1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,560
Thank you, ma'am.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,720
We are recording us there.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,680
Have you watched Group one flip grade?

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,440
Have we improved on acting?

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,960
I just got back from the
from my home town.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,120
I was busy somewhere else.

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,320
Will watch these your videos now

8
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,520
as a long while in muscle and muscle

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,960
animal. So

10
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,520
you guys can also start following me.

11
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,120
I was trying to find Java basics
rap on guitar, but I could not find it.

12
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,640
Is it? Yes, it is still there.

13
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,440
But we have made it private.

14
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,400
So those who are invested in in the code,

15
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,400
you guys can send me your

16
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,240
username for the gear tab and I will add

17
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,240
you as collaborator to that repository.

18
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,520
They are private now so that only

19
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:31,920
you guys can access it.

20
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,960
So create a new project

21
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:39,880
thinking

22
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,760
it's fine.

23
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:51,040
Dennis Or should we send you
your GitHub username and password? No.

24
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,000
Simple one.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,920
No, no, no.

26
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:58,560
The simple project.

27
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,840
What becomes private on an on GitHub,

28
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,800
something that was public
became private on GitHub.

29
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,880
Now so groovy. No, no, no, no.

30
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,200
Simple simple Java project

31
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,400
then Dennis

32
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,040
it's the it's the or almost
all the repositories.

33
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,800
We will make them private.

34
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,040
Guys, give me a thumbs up.

35
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,640
Once you are done creating the project

36
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,520
and that we will discuss
on some other class,

37
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:45,600
you'll get to, or
maybe you guys can google it or ask them.

38
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,960
I only have command line app option.

39
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,680
Yes, that is fine.
I have installed some extra plugins.

40
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,960
That's why I see all of the other options.

41
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,440
It's fine.

42
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,040
We will not be using the sale in idle
or a simple one.

43
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,600
We will be adding command line app.

44
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,680
What should we name it?

45
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,240
Namely on the name of your wife.

46
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,120
She will be happy

47
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,920
the time near me.

48
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,320
What should I do?

49
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,720
Dawn's housing

50
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,800
if I don't have a wife? You.

51
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,920
You are the best man on earth, man.

52
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,520
That's

53
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,520
nice.

54
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:58,280
And then click on Finish,
start from the elder

55
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,680
one and

56
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,680
well, by the way,
before we start the class,

57
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,320
guys, tell me honestly,
what did you do to my last server?

58
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,560
Ordered it.

59
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,600
I saw the video

60
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,040
and Diego shared
the admin username and password with you.

61
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,840
Right.

62
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,360
And I know if you guys have the admin
privileges, what happens with that

63
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,800
next piece of thing?

64
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,520
Right.

65
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,360
So he shared the actually

66
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,600
this was the this, this was the admin one

67
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,400
who use this username and password
we just followed.

68
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,800
Know you guys are not that gentle

69
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,160
means
that you will only follow the instructor.

70
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:57,840
I know.

71
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,080
Definitely
you will try everything that is possible.

72
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,200
And then because it is simple, you get the

73
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,120
guy. I'm just kidding.

74
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,160
I was just checking what happened.

75
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,360
Maybe I can find some.

76
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:15,800
I'm sorry.

77
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,240
Just a dump project
and just a Java project.

78
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:27,400
Sebastian, are you guys good?

79
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:40,920
Everyone has a Java project
now, so let's start from here.

80
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,120
Guys, If I have a website

81
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,680
like, for example, Amazon or Facebook,

82
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,040
why don't I use my personal laptop

83
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:56,080
to host that website
to store all the code that is executed?

84
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,760
And you guys see the those web pages.

85
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,240
Why, why, why,
why not use the local computers

86
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,720
like for example
when we're here WW dot Amazon dot com

87
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,560
that the code for that
website is stored somewhere right

88
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,320
that code executed and you guys see

89
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,080
the output

90
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,000
do you guys know how to create
a simple website

91
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:29,240
how does the code look
like for a simple website. No

92
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,560
let me show you

93
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:53,760
maybe let's take this one.

94
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,880
You guys don't need to follow me.

95
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,960
You guys can watch the video later on
because I have this to show you.

96
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,080
A lot of things.

97
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,000
So then I will say,

98
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,720
then you guys have to follow me. Okay?

99
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,760
Otherwise, just focus in here.

100
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,280
I named my project Stephen Jenkins.

101
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,120
Is that okay? Yep.

102
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:48,480
So let me extract the code
for this website.

103
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:55,440
So once I extracted that,
this is how it looks like.

104
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,120
So if I add this index dot edge
demo, you see,

105
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,520
this is how this website
looks like from my local computer.

106
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,160
And this is how these websites
are structured usually.

107
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,040
So if I write it can open it with
and maybe we just showed

108
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:18,560
you poor.

109
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,040
This is the code behind this web page
that you guys are seeing.

110
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,400
So is most of is now right now HD, HTML

111
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,880
and CCed.

112
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,200
So for example

113
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,360
what is

114
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:48,000
the title.

115
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
So for example
if I want to change may be about us

116
00:08:52,520 --> 00:09:06,080
because something goes.

117
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,840
If I save this

118
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,080
and reload

119
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:17,080
this page, you see about match 11.

120
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,640
So it's, it's like any other program.

121
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,680
It's not right.

122
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,880
There is a great humor on SD email
being called as a programing language.

123
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,520
So this is just

124
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,320
markup language.

125
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,720
So all those things that you guys see on

126
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,640
a web page, they are also coded

127
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,880
in some kind of languages, for example,

128
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,040
who have that look and feel.

129
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,080
We use SD, email and C
CST to have a behavior.

130
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,720
For example,
when I am when I click on somewhere

131
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,760
and when it takes me to the other pages,
all those things, they are all coded

132
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,280
in other programing languages like Java
or maybe using JavaScript

133
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,360
and then to store
the data related to that website.

134
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:06,880
We use

135
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,680
database programing languages like school

136
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,520
and other.

137
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,880
So this is how things look like.

138
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,520
So what happens in the industry?

139
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,880
Developers,
they will be changing this code to

140
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,920
meet the requirements
of the clients, right?

141
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,360
Once they make all the changes,
they will show those changes

142
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,200
to the applied and once the

143
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,840
before they the show this to the end users

144
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,880
they actually don't store

145
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,640
that copy that they show to the end user
on their local computers.

146
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,040
Yes because they are developing something
definitely they will be having a copy

147
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:50,680
working copy on their computers,
but they create

148
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,000
a computer on the Internet,
on some kind of

149
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,440
cloud.

150
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:01,480
They put all of this code that you guys
see in here inside that computer,

151
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,840
and then they share their
dentures for that computer

152
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,280
in the form of these

153
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,560
two. The developers did that.

154
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,240
Let's declare next. Those are shared.

155
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,720
Then they

156
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,320
register these domains

157
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:24,120
which will once some end user
will type in that domain.

158
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,000
For example, WW dot, Facebook, dot com.

159
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,160
So there is a very big register

160
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,440
that all the internet providers have.

161
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,840
They will look for the server

162
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,160
from that you are l for example right now
I'm using the internet as strong fiber

163
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,040
so they have
that I have access to that register

164
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,000
once I hit WW dot Facebook dot com.

165
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,520
They will check the actual server
behind that link

166
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,320
and it will take your request

167
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,720
in the form of

168
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,280
executing most of the form.

169
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,720
But most of the time
I should keep the request to their server

170
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:06,800
and this web page will be loaded
inside your browser.

171
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,440
So once the developers they keep
on developing, adding new features,

172
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,440
keep on pushing that code to that machine
and the end users

173
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,600
can see those changes right away.

174
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,680
For example, the clients.

175
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,080
So so they all the developers,

176
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:29,960
they also use a lot of a lot of the tools
that look similar.

177
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,040
For example, an idea to manage discord

178
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,080
and repository management system,

179
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,560
to give the history of the code

180
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,560
and then other tools
to build their projects.

181
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,440
Maybe one, for example, of Gradle
or something like that.

182
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:51,520
So once you have this website,

183
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,680
once that website is posted to that link,

184
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:01,880
then the job of best stocks
we will need to we just want let know.

185
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,680
You guys don't need.

186
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,600
So once you have that link.

187
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,240
So for example then the job of like that's
the stock support example

188
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,760
client asked that maybe he wants to

189
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,280
once we are on the about this page

190
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,800
so maybe I don't know
client wants to see about batch 11

191
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,600
when we are on the home page
and when we are on our clients page, then

192
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:37,440
clients want to see if that about batch
1110 is too bad about us or not.

193
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,240
So this is the requirement that
you guys have, so you will take this link

194
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,040
and then just start

195
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,240
about testing the and then

196
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,240
that that that Bob Bob on that website.

197
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:56,320
But why we don't use our local computers
to do all of this

198
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:13,800
because we have a lot of issues
with the local computers.

199
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,080
So first of all they are

200
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,520
limited in system resources.

201
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:30,640
For example,

202
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,280
Abram base

203
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:41,160
processor, Internet bandwidth.

204
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:41,400
All right.

205
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:46,560
So, so the normal Internet that we use
in our homes is

206
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,560
it's not that good at that that great.

207
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,840
Imagine the traffic to Amazon, right?

208
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,000
There are millions of requests.

209
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:59,320
So we need very high speed Internet,

210
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,280
huge amounts of disk space,
RAM and all that.

211
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:12,720
And this is how the servers look like.

212
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,000
They are very big giant computers.

213
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,600
They are not like teeny tiny computers
or laptop

214
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,440
that we have in our homes
and they are very small history.

215
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,680
Granted, no one is allowed
to enter these buildings.

216
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:31,400
They are all connected to gigabytes
of gigabytes per second.

217
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,080
And in the internet,
speed is very, very high.

218
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,360
These they have special

219
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,120
equipment to pull down all the systems,

220
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,160
3 to 4 layers of security,

221
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,920
physical security,
cyber security and all that.

222
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,160
Because imagine the Jeff Bezos has Amazon
website

223
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:53,760
hosted on his laptop
and maybe I don't know and let's just

224
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,680
say is the laptop of Jeff Bezos
and now he is the owner of Amazon.

225
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,920
So they have very good security,

226
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,240
physical security, cyber security, and now

227
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,360
huge, huge beams,
technical teams to manage all lots.

228
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,040
Even if I show you

229
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,760
this. So

230
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,800
this is Microsoft servers.

231
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,920
The Microsoft even have developed
a container.

232
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,080
They put all of these computers
inside these big, big giant containers

233
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,480
and they place these containers
under the sea

234
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,360
because it's easier to pull down.

235
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,840
Under the sea, he dissipates
than dissipation is easy for us.

236
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,000
These computers, they are very sensitive,

237
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,760
will be dark matter and all those U.V.

238
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:51,640
radiations
that we receive from the open, open

239
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,240
sky. So they have to protect that as well.

240
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,160
So they put this under the sea

241
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,160
and they observed huge

242
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,840
performance gains and all huge

243
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,680
benefits in other areas as well.

244
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:15,080
For example, the computers that they use
inside these containers, usually

245
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:23,520
the computers, they fail on a daily basis
because there are lot of.

246
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:31,680
So if you guys watch it carefully,
there are multiple computers

247
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:36,560
that are connected
in areas of the servers.

248
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:40,320
They are nothing but multiple computers
connected and added. So

249
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:47,400
it's very frequent that on a daily basis,
maybe one or two computers, they fail

250
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,240
and then they have to replace them
with the other computers on maybe

251
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,320
hard disk
that are connected to these computers.

252
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:57,720
They fail or they have replaced some other
equipment inside of those computers.

253
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,160
So but, but the results were impressive.

254
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,480
And now they are extending this project.

255
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,200
But still, I will not

256
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,480
recommend to use
any services from Microsoft

257
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,080
because you guys, you and you guys know

258
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,160
why, right?

259
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:19,520
This is

260
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,640
so that's why

261
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,280
we have these systems.

262
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,120
We had a room for server in our company
in there about this watchmen working there

263
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:34,080
as we were mentioning it, server rooms
all the time.

264
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,720
One day this poor guy asked me,
Who is this server?

265
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,320
Why he is not coming outside.

266
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,120
I want to see him

267
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,840
because half of the index lasted five
plus exponential.

268
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:47,800
There

269
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,240
he is.

270
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,280
You guys know those who are aren't asking

271
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,160
why Try to upgrade your windows
to Windows 11?

272
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,840
40 years of experience.

273
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:05,080
They have been working in this sector
for 40 plus years

274
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,760
is one of the top
ten biggest companies in the world

275
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,800
and still you cannot drag

276
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,640
and drop things in Windows 11.

277
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,760
That's why that's why you should not use
any services from make this up.

278
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,480
If someone cannot build a good Windows
in 30, 40 years,

279
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,160
why would someone want to buy
services from that company?

280
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,160
Because then why do you make fun of Mac
users?

281
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,240
They are because one step ahead

282
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,800
from that Microsoft guys,

283
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,760
they took the kernel from Linux.

284
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,840
They didn't build anything on their own.

285
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,720
They do all the underlying structure
from Unix and Linux.

286
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,680
They just gave them the UI.

287
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,800
And now you guys see the Mac

288
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,480
and you have to pay thousands of dollars

289
00:19:52,480 --> 00:20:02,400
to buy that.

290
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,400
So if we if we have to

291
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:11,280
if we use our personal laptop or computer,
we have limited of system resources.

292
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,600
We have to

293
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,040
keep it up all the time.

294
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:21,600
Right?

295
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,640
It needs

296
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,040
to be connected to

297
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,560
our supply

298
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,880
because imagine

299
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,000
guys that you are hosting your website

300
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,080
on your local computer and

301
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,760
you only turn
it on in the morning and then

302
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,760
turn it
off in the evening before you go to sleep.

303
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,880
Right? Imagine the website like

304
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,600
I think their revenue is millions
or at least thousands

305
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,040
per second

306
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,240
each Second it's $4,722.

307
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,520
So we have to make sure that all
those laptop computers are servers.

308
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,800
They are up all the time

309
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:28,080
because even if they are not on
for a single second,

310
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:34,280
it can cost you thousands of dollars.

311
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,520
And then you have to make sure
for the security,

312
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,280
then you have to make sure
that that thing is accessible everywhere.

313
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,200
So that's the reason we want to put
everything inside those servers

314
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,640
and then we share those resources
with everyone.

315
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,120
I think Elon Musk started
going in on his own

316
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,360
computer and running server
during the day and ordered at night.

317
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,400
It was

318
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,440
in nineties before we went,
even before that nineties global,

319
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:06,440
you know, the internet Sweden
that in those days I remember at least

320
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,400
first I have to dial a mobile number
to connect to the internet

321
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,680
and then I have to wait
for like 15 minutes before

322
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,640
I can get speed of like
three cables per second.

323
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:21,400
So it was fine in those days,
but not today.

324
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:26,400
If this I remember, I used to buy packages

325
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,360
like for example,
I don't know, a package for three,

326
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,400
three, maybe, or five,
maybe or ten maybe on mobile phones.

327
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:41,400
So it was okay in those days, even
in early 2000, it was okay, but not today.

328
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:50,160
It's so that's why we

329
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,000
want to put

330
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:05,520
everything on servers.

331
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,720
I used to play Counter-Strike with 36.

332
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,080
Gave you back in the old days? Yes.

333
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,040
Do you guys know about this?

334
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,400
So you guys know
all about the SDLC software?

335
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,880
The development lifecycle.

336
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,600
Right.

337
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,840
But do you guys also know about this
software deployment

338
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:32,040
lifecycle?

339
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,080
So how software is deployed?

340
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,400
Okay, you guys don't know.

341
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,440
Okay.

342
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,680
Is it okay if I take like one extra hour
today from you guys?

343
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,760
Maybe those who know something,
you guys can watch

344
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,960
the recording, those who can stay.

345
00:23:47,960 --> 00:24:01,400
Please, please try to steps.

346
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,560
So what do you guys think
once the website is developed?

347
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,320
I was in Internet shop. Internet cafe.

348
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:12,720
I turn it on and go to my bed and a cup
of tea outside to open the browser. Yep.

349
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,640
What was the browser?

350
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,640
Internet Explorer.

351
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,520
You knock

352
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,440
and then yes,

353
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:27,640
I believe you. Or.

354
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,200
And by the way, after 15 minutes

355
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,200
there,
it takes 15 minutes to load that web site.

356
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,000
And after 15 minutes,

357
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,480
once the website is about to load,
we get an error from Internet Explorer.

358
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,680
That Internet Explorer has crashed

359
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,600
and now
we have to redo all of those things.

360
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:51,560
I have personally observed
that experience that.

361
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,280
So as as we have a software

362
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:59,280
development lifecycle, we have software
deployment lifecycle as well.

363
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,600
For example once.

364
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,280
So this is from where
all of these things start.

365
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,320
Like for example, if someone say,

366
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,440
I want to build a a website,

367
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:16,160
so developers will build that website
as well, test that web size

368
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,440
I do team will deploy that website
and all the prompts,

369
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,560
but from the editor starts
every from where everything starts

370
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,480
planning or idea, right?

371
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,240
Maybe there is a client
who has an idea of something

372
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,080
and they want to build
build those things, right?

373
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,800
So it starts from an idea
and the first step is idea, right?

374
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,440
And then definitely they have the budget.

375
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:46,160
So offer to the idea they, they, they,
they go to the

376
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,400
some kind of companies who provide

377
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,560
the development services

378
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:57,880
and then they tell them the idea

379
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:02,480
and they start working on Mark designs
right after the idea.

380
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,560
So second thing, we have multiple designs
in which the look and feel and all of

381
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:12,920
those features are discussed,
what the mock designs are, the final

382
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,920
graphic designers, they build these things
over the client, say, okay, maybe

383
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:20,560
this button should love, shouldn't
have this color, it should look like this.

384
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,360
We should have these tracks in here
and in here and all those things.

385
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,920
It's kind of a blueprint.

386
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,280
And with this mock design, they also

387
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,400
produce a document, the

388
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,720
from client side.

389
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,400
We have some team members
and from the companies

390
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,120
who are providing services,
we call them as business analysts.

391
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:46,600
They have good knowledge of technical
things and a good knowledge of

392
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,160
business domain as well. So

393
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,080
do you guys know the

394
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,400
name of that document
which the beard develops

395
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:02,520
after having the meetings
with the clients?

396
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,880
Yes, It's very important for Jenkins

397
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:11,120
that you guys first understand.

398
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:15,320
So it is called SRT
Software Requirement document.

399
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:26,280
Yeah. If,

400
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,200
for example, if I can show you

401
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:49,360
how does it look like?

402
00:27:49,360 --> 00:28:15,840
It's a very ugly document, by the way.

403
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,680
So these are how it looks like

404
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,720
for all the all the features.

405
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:28,480
We have a feature ID, for example,
if someone wants to have a payment system,

406
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,960
they will give it
that payment system and ID

407
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:35,760
and then they will describe, okay,
this is the number, this is the future ID

408
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,720
and this is what we want
inside this feature.

409
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,080
So they will discuss.

410
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,280
They will write all the basic flaws.

411
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,080
For example, once they click on a button,

412
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,400
what's going to happen next
once they enter the current information?

413
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,800
What should happen next?
And all those steps, right?

414
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:53,720
If basic steps,
how to go with the alternate

415
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,440
steps and all that,
what should be the preconditions?

416
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,680
For example, a user must be logged in
before he can pay the money, right?

417
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,280
And then the post conditions
and all and all that.

418
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:08,240
So it happens for
with all the features that

419
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,040
are that

420
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,920
that, that they need to be developed
in their website.

421
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,400
Look, Michel, this thing

422
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,880
so this is the second thing

423
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,040
that is developed

424
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:28,560
it will help you greatly once
you start your job.

425
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:33,240
So every time I teach Jenkins,
I give at least 30 minutes.

426
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,680
Overview on all the process
and how everything works.

427
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,400
I'm shocked to learn
so that you guys can understand from

428
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,240
start learning how the flow looks.

429
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,400
So once the study is developed,
the next step is that that study is handed

430
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:58,200
over to the architects.

431
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,600
So architects,

432
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,360
by the way,
these are the software architects,

433
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,360
software architects, A,

434
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,520
s, R, D,

435
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:20,280
and the developer SRS.

436
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,760
It is then another document that both the

437
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,560
that discusses
how much RAM we will be needing,

438
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,720
how much hard disk

439
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,320
we will be needing, how much processors
we'll be needing to build this,

440
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,880
which kind of tools will be used,
which programing languages will be used,

441
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:43,720
which ideas will be used, which
all of the tools, softwares, programing,

442
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:48,120
languages and everything that is needed
to produce this application.

443
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:52,440
They are discussed in this document
by software architects,

444
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:57,920
and then they also design the glasses.

445
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:02,080
For example, the developers will develop
maybe 15 glasses.

446
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,120
These will be the names of the glasses.

447
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,720
Inside all those glasses,
these will be the meters.

448
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,640
They will contain this functionality.

449
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,640
Once this method will be called,
this will happen and all there.

450
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,800
So all those teeny tiny details other than

451
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,520
the actual code are mentioned inside.

452
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:22,720
This SRS is software development
lifecycle part of software dev lifecycle,

453
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,880
just like SDLC. Yes. Yes. Mohammed

454
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:12,520
So once
they have this SRS, the actual developers,

455
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:17,760
they start coding those classes of meters
and start building the code base.

456
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,760
So from here the coding starts

457
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,760
software requirements

458
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,840
specification, you'll get that.

459
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,240
So from here the developers will start
developing the code.

460
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:41,280
So the developers

461
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:44,640
big SRS and start the code.

462
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:50,480
Meanwhile, in the same time,
the best as they

463
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:55,360
they'd be s, r d and start

464
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,680
designing the test cases.

465
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,160
The code is yet to develop,

466
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:07,120
but because you guys will be having
the requirements so you get you guys

467
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:11,040
can start writing all those scenarios
and all those test cases

468
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,280
right?

469
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,360
And then you will take help from B as
if something is not clear

470
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,680
or from your test
layers are from architects as well.

471
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,320
So this is

472
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,320
from where you guys will start working.

473
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,080
Yeah. So lots of the code is developed.

474
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:41,760
Then the actual software

475
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,360
deployment lifecycle

476
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:51,600
starts from here.

477
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,840
Is it clear guys, all of these six points

478
00:33:55,400 --> 00:34:02,640
before
we're jumping to the actual lifecycle?

479
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,840
So first

480
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:09,960
developers will develop the code

481
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:14,040
on the local computers and

482
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:20,280
will push it to the

483
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,880
dev servers.

484
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:35,600
It's the deployment and deployment.

485
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,480
So do you guys know

486
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,680
about the type of servers
that companies have, like for example,

487
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,680
dev server
for us out of Australia and server

488
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,440
and then production server

489
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:56,880
or yes,
they are called environments as well.

490
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:00,360
Yep. Yep.

491
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,560
So you guys know about environments,
right?

492
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,680
Okay, perfect.

493
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,640
So deaths are servers

494
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,000
and worse
the is deployed to their servers.

495
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Then they will check if everything is
working fine on the server as well

496
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,800
because on your local computers
you might have a different version

497
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,520
of Windows or different operating system,
different hardware requirements.

498
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:24,600
So some things that work on your computer
might not work on a server,

499
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,720
so they make sure

500
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:30,360
before they hand over the code to you,
before they hand over the actual web

501
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:34,640
app to you, they make sure that it works
good on the dev servers.

502
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,360
So once it works,
it works good on the server, then that

503
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,680
thing is deployed

504
00:35:41,680 --> 00:36:05,040
on the US server.

505
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:05,440
Okay.

506
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,320
And then you guys can start the testing,
right?

507
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,000
So here you guys will be needing Jenkins.

508
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,160
Okay, so what do you guys think?

509
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,680
If I have to pass to something again

510
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:25,280
and again, for example,
regression testing,

511
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,760
the companies,
they test all the existing features

512
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,360
before they deploy them
to the production servers.

513
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,400
So what do you guys think?

514
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,160
Is it a good idea
to automate that as well, or

515
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,160
we should do it manually

516
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,640
before each release?

517
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:53,840
We have to test the existing features
right?

518
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:57,800
And there is a team involved in here guys.

519
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,920
Did either team involved
and here, for example, their team

520
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,920
make sure that something is deployed
on the Dempster world and

521
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,000
that same thing is also deployed on

522
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,040
the server.

523
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,000
Then same is deployed
on the spreading server

524
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,000
and then the

525
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,680
same is deployed on the production server.

526
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,400
So can you guys imagine the time
it takes something from this

527
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,800
dev server or dev environment
to reach this production server?

528
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:36,560
And how many employees are involved
in these deployments?

529
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,520
It depends on the size of the company,
but usually

530
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:44,760
3 to 5 persons

531
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,200
are involved

532
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:59,600
even in a very basic web
just for the deployment.

533
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,280
Yes, it depends on the product,

534
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:07,560
but at least 3 to 5 persons on
or even in a very, very basic, simple.

535
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:11,280
And by basic,
I mean, let's say the hello world.

536
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:16,200
Okay, you guys,
do you guys know the Helloworld?

537
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,240
They are called dev ops guys.

538
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:24,520
The so this is the Helloworld.

539
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:28,840
Even if they have got deployed,
the helloworld,

540
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,760
this is the most
widely developed application

541
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,480
on planet out.

542
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,160
So at least 3 to 5%.

543
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:44,680
So who manages all these servers
and all these deployments and everything.

544
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,960
So Jenkins with Will will

545
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,920
actually replace these 3 to 5 persons.

546
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,320
Once we've set up a Jenkins
we will not be needing this

547
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:58,600
3 to 5 persons,
maybe one person will be enough

548
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:04,280
who will take care of the servers
and the Jenkins as well.

549
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,040
Right.

550
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,720
And everything will be automated
if we don't use Jenkins, what happens?

551
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,960
Developers send an email to the devil guy

552
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,080
and then they ask him to deploy
that application.

553
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:20,760
Then the professionals
have to do the same.

554
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:25,080
Once you have to deploy that same thing
on staging duty and all those servers,

555
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,800
you have to repeat that process again
and again, taking approvals

556
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,440
from your manager,
the team leader and all that.

557
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:38,360
For me, it used to take weeks before,
even if I am just adding a single

558
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:43,240
line of code, it used to take weeks
to get that line to the production server.

559
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:46,280
It's that slow and a lot of approvals.

560
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,400
A lot of my emails

561
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:51,000
to other teams are involved
to make sure that everything looks good.

562
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:54,880
So Jenkins
helps us in this, this, this pain point.

563
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:59,240
Once we have Jenkins set up,
I will just click a button

564
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,720
that will be deployed
automatically on the dev server.

565
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,840
It will be tested

566
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:08,080
automatically on the server
it once their traffic issues are passed,

567
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:11,480
that same will be deployed
automatically on the QC server

568
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,640
and on the US server.

569
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,480
The Jenkins that you guys
will be setting up.

570
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,920
The best guess is existing test
cases will also be executed

571
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,240
automatically if all the cases boss

572
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,560
their thing

573
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,320
be deployed to the staging server,
automatically,

574
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,800
the production automatically,
and all those test cases

575
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,720
that you guys will specify
will be executed on those servers.

576
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:42,840
Yesterday I was dreaming about this
spool and review and job.

577
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:55,800
I woke up and a big headache
like I was in battle.

578
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:59,160
So let's start from the very basic

579
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,200
Hello world.

580
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:04,600
Yeah.

581
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,560
So let me write or I

582
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,400
Yeah so and let me actually

583
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,960
it will be super super fast so let me put

584
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,600
but I don't sleep and let's say maybe

585
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:41,600
I don't know 2 seconds.

586
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,920
So this is very, very simple. Yes.

587
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:49,280
Now you guys should follow me. Yes.

588
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:54,160
Jenkins, do the deployment
and best execution of your best case

589
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,520
is automatically on a server

590
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,720
which you are doing of Java.

591
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,480
You are using

592
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:11,840
now, Will.

593
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,680
Why? You want to know that I'm using
Java nine to

594
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,360
you guys can use any word and

595
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:21,520
but if you guys use Java eight
it will be good

596
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:26,280
because I think the maximum version
that Jenkins response

597
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,360
is Java online
to make sure everyone of you have Java

598
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:29,960
eight

599
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,360
mind don't give

600
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:45,400
four look it's intelligent not Java.

601
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:49,240
Login loops are available
in almost all the Java games.

602
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:55,720
Offer them 1.5.

603
00:42:55,720 --> 00:43:00,160
So you guys have been executing everything
inside the till now, right?

604
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,840
You contribute ten,
then you see the output

605
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:09,120
but this is not how it works
on the actual production servers.

606
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,440
On the actual production server.

607
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:17,160
This code is compiled
and then is deployed on the server

608
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:20,560
and then the command to execute
that server is sent.

609
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,440
So for example, if I have to

610
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,280
execute

611
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:34,520
discord, so let me,

612
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,440
let me copy this main or Java

613
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,320
and look for the third file in here

614
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,360
and let me copy this address.

615
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:04,200
So why is your Windows DART team?

616
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,680
But Intermediate is like

617
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:13,440
so you want to know the actual reason.

618
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,080
SIMON So for example, if I

619
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,360
if I do that,

620
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,360
for example, if I chain this,

621
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:27,440
you see my color, it it now
changes, right?

622
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,200
I don't look great,

623
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:34,080
but if I change it to light team,
it reflects good light on my face.

624
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,560
You see, now I look pretty.

625
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:38,320
There's the reason
I use the light team and

626
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:48,760
I got.

627
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:51,160
I have also learned some tricks
from ladies.

628
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:54,640
Right. So nice.

629
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,360
When you sit in front of interviews,

630
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,720
please make sure you have
good light on your face as

631
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,320
so once I have that

632
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:13,960
on my computer, for example,
I can use that light

633
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:23,360
for kickoff.

634
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:27,360
So for example,
most of the most of the things,

635
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,040
this is how they are compiled
and deploy it.

636
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:35,760
So for example, if I see a silly

637
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,160
do you know why

638
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:44,360
when I write my scenario in feature
file step which are not implemented

639
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:47,240
or not highlighted here,
so it is not related to the class

640
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:52,800
for how to plug in and intelligent
that we need to install.

641
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,960
Maybe you can send me a direct message.

642
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,440
Let a student ready

643
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,200
by the hand of the game

644
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,400
next time and

645
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,800
you guys not need to follow me
in here as well.

646
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:55,480
Okay.

647
00:46:55,560 --> 00:47:13,080
Just I just wanted to show you
this is how things are compiled.

648
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:19,520
So, for example, if I have to do that
ranting, this is what I have.

649
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:23,000
So the Java compiler is called Java.

650
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,520
See, this is an application
that will be compiling 40

651
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,680
and then we specify the

652
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:36,880
name of the class.

653
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,720
So you guys see now we have this
main dart class.

654
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:41,280
Main dart class.

655
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:45,280
So discord
that was there in this main dart,

656
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,320
Java has been compiled to be bytecode.

657
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:51,840
And if I want to run this bytecode

658
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:57,600
on my computer, then I can simply say Java

659
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:00,720
and then me.

660
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,320
Well, let me check.

661
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:08,040
What was the name of the package?

662
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:32,320
Oops, give me one

663
00:48:32,320 --> 00:49:32,160
one page.

664
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,600
Capital M

665
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:35,920
Okay,

666
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,680
so we have

667
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,920
we have moved to this directory.

668
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:43,480
Now, if I want to compile this, I say

669
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,720
man or Java.

670
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:48,960
It is compiled now.

671
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:53,440
I will see the compile code
and if I want to run that I see

672
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:57,720
and I see my output right.

673
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:02,560
So on production servers on your life,
this is how your code will be compiled

674
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:05,320
and this is how it because that executed
on production servers,

675
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:08,920
there are no ideas on production servers.

676
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:21,720
It is only in your local computers.

677
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,520
So you guys see and now I see the output.

678
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,640
So this is how the code is compiled
and executed.

679
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:31,080
Now let's try to do the same with Jenkins.

680
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:47,680
So are you guys logged in in Jenkins?

681
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,520
Okay,
follow me, guys. Log in to the Jenkins

682
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:55,800
as element.

683
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,680
No, I have revoked the privileges for you.

684
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,040
You guys don't have any access.

685
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:06,120
Now, you guys can create the project
and execute it.

686
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:10,240
I don't want to be doing the same thing.

687
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:14,640
And yes, I am definitely afraid of you

688
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:18,120
and the companies who will be hiring you.

689
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:25,920
They should also upgrade from you.

690
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:31,080
Please, please write in your resume
and that you are an adventurer as well.

691
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:35,560
You take risks,
you can destroy the self, etc.

692
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:39,440
and you can delay the production

693
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:54,440
release maybe by weeks.

694
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,440
I missed the last class
worth the Gardasil.

695
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:59,480
Or should we register then if they are
available in post announcement?

696
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:11,480
Yes. So this could take a little little.

697
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:12,160
Let me know guys.

698
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:16,440
Once everyone of you are logged
in and you see this page

699
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:22,800
five plus years in this point

700
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:31,160
it looks different.

701
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:38,960
I am better due to the latest work done.

702
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,920
I actually had to do it.

703
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:45,960
I was planning this to do it
for a long time, but you guys forced me

704
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:49,120
forcibly to delete

705
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:59,000
something.

706
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,400
Yeah, but

707
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:05,680
then I need.

708
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:11,880
So let's create a very simple project
and let's try to learn

709
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:15,760
how everything works from the very basics.

710
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,760
So this is how is very simple
Job is created.

711
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:24,800
Okay, so let's see a bit of a guide.

712
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:28,680
When you name a project in Jenkins,
put your name as well

713
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:32,040
with the project so that you guys
don't mess up the other projects.

714
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:34,680
All you guys can remember
the name of their project

715
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,960
so you can give any name to your project.

716
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:53,000
I clicked on new item

717
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:02,560
and click on this

718
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:08,360
freestyle project.

719
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:09,600
Click on this freestyle.

720
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:12,160
What is the username and password

721
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:15,480
you're signing course and down to?

722
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:29,400
I could not find it, I think.

723
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,280
Are you guys good?

724
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:37,440
Can I move to the next step?

725
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,480
So if you can. Okay.

726
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:41,280
So this is how I'll do it.

727
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:46,400
By the way,
the projects are called jobs in Jenkins.

728
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:49,840
So if you guys hear this terminology,
don't be afraid.

729
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,560
So they are called jobs.

730
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,960
And now let's see, maybe

731
00:54:58,280 --> 00:54:59,880
if I want to execute that

732
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:02,520
for pipeline, I will teach you later.

733
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:07,840
So now let me push

734
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:14,040
push this code

735
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:17,440
and you guys can use the same board

736
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:20,800
from me.

737
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,680
You guys don't need to follow me here.

738
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:34,960
I will share building.

739
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,560
I created a simple project

740
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,160
like for me to build

741
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:14,160
a repository.

742
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:18,400
You guys don't need to follow me,
so I am just creating a new repository.

743
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:22,040
So let's say I am starting from the ready.

744
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,360
Ready, start.

745
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:26,640
So batch 11

746
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:31,800
Jenkins

747
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:35,160
I create the repository.

748
00:56:35,160 --> 00:57:35,760
So this is how you guys will put your pass
if you are starting from scratch,

749
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,040
send me a picture of it. It's

750
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:45,400
so now if I refresh this page,
I should see my project in here.

751
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:48,280
Okay.

752
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:51,840
So the things, once
they are developed on the local computer,

753
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:57,080
they will be posted to the YouTube
and from the GitHub,

754
00:57:57,080 --> 00:58:00,360
the Jenkins
installer will fetch that code.

755
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:03,880
And if you want to do that, you have to

756
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:07,960
go inside this source
for the management system.

757
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,760
Now you guys should follow me.

758
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:13,680
So inside the source code
manager system, if we click on gate

759
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:19,000
and if we paste, here is the link.

760
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:21,120
If we paste this link

761
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:25,320
now, Jenkins will effectively data
from this repository

762
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:28,080
and it will create a job

763
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:31,600
in here. Okay.

764
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:35,400
So for example,
if I click on Apply and Save

765
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:40,640
you guys also see this

766
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:49,160
same page.

767
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,360
Oh right.

768
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:53,760
So click on build. Now

769
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:01,160
and once you click on building now

770
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:08,160
and click on Console output

771
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,600
model, what are you doing

772
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:14,360
backwards selection, backwards,
backward selection in your keyboard.

773
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:14,960
Okay,

774
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:18,240
so you guys see that Jenkins has already

775
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,640
fetch the code from the GitHub

776
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:26,640
and it has stored
all the code inside its project.

777
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:29,000
So if we go back

778
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:40,080
and if we click on Workspace,

779
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,800
so you guys will see that. Now

780
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,400
you have all the folders

781
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:50,760
and everything
that you had on your local computer

782
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:54,640
which you push later on to your new tab.

783
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:58,840
Now it is not slow.

784
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:11,240
It should not be slow this time. Yes.

785
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:15,720
So all the folders code
and everything has been pushed

786
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,240
to the Jenkins and it has fetched

787
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:24,320
all the information from the YouTube
and it has created

788
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:28,840
a directory, a repository,
as you see on your local computer.

789
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:33,320
So for example, if I go inside seen tags,
I see main door down the door.

790
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:43,600
So everything is first
from that repository.

791
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:44,080
Yeah.

792
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:47,320
And now anything that I can do

793
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:50,600
on my computer, on my local computer,

794
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:54,440
I can also do that on Jenkins server.

795
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:59,040
All the commands that I want to execute
on my local computer,

796
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:02,360
I can execute those commands
in here as well.

797
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:05,280
So for example, if I click on configure

798
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:08,480
something,

799
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,880
I can, for example,

800
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:18,560
write,

801
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:21,960
I can click on Build

802
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:24,440
and if I click on Execute Shell

803
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:30,680
so I can write any command

804
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:35,320
to do anything with this project
on the Jenkins server, for example,

805
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:40,160
I can compiled this code and I can execute
this code on this Jenkins server.

806
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:43,200
So for example, I can see

807
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:50,880
what was the main package name.

808
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,920
So Java C

809
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:56,720
and then Main or Java

810
01:01:57,120 --> 01:02:00,520
and then I can execute

811
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,360
this code

812
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:06,120
using the same command that I did

813
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:11,320
on my computer.

814
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:14,080
They're going to send you
these commands as well

815
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:19,400
that we know
once you guys have written these commands.

816
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:23,400
So you have to go to build a section
and then you have to click

817
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:30,840
on Execute Shell
and then you have derived these numbers.

818
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:32,480
So click on Apply and Save

819
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:35,160
and let's click on

820
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:50,840
Get It. Now.

821
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:53,000
So this this day is not capital.

822
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,360
Give me one.

823
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:57,480
So go back to project,

824
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:59,720
click on Configure

825
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:04,000
and change this

826
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,360
to low look

827
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:11,160
and click on big.

828
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:14,080
Now again for

829
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:19,200
I don't know if the Java Sea
or not on this computer

830
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,080
that is but

831
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,280
yep we need to install

832
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:35,800
the Java compiler as well.

833
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:37,400
Okay.

834
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,880
I don't see the console
when I click build now.

835
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:42,360
It would not take me to the next page.

836
01:03:43,040 --> 01:04:01,280
Are you guys clicking on console output?

837
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:05,120
So if we go back to the

838
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:08,480
let me go to go back to the dashboard.

839
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:11,280
So you guys have put it
in all of your projects, right?

840
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:15,240
And if I search for my

841
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:19,960
project, I see my project

842
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:23,360
enter

843
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:27,360
and then
have you guys clicked on this builder?

844
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:32,880
Now? Okay,

845
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:35,920
so after that,
you guys have to click on in here

846
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:37,320
and here

847
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:43,160
to get to that console

848
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:52,960
like this.

849
01:04:52,960 --> 01:05:04,640
Yes, that means there is
there was an error, not there.

850
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:07,480
Now, did you click on Builder?

851
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:11,360
Now. Yes.

852
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:12,480
Affiliated.

853
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:26,480
Okay.

854
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:30,680
It says file not found,
which means Which means

855
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:32,920
we have to specify the directory.

856
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:36,080
So go back to project

857
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:45,600
side B workspace.

858
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:46,400
Give me one moment.

859
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:49,360
This.

860
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:51,480
Let me fix it

861
01:05:52,160 --> 01:06:07,080
and then you guys can follow me.

862
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:09,800
Did you delete your package
name on your intelligent?

863
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:15,600
Yes. Yes,

864
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:17,040
I did. That

865
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,120
and now should work.

866
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:28,040
So we have to navigate to that folder
as so you see on Jenkins.

867
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:30,160
I see my output as well.

868
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,920
Yeah. The code is executable.

869
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:38,040
It was compiled and executed on Jenkins
as well and it is successful this time.

870
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:39,840
So let me send you the updated commands

871
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:44,920
and we have to navigate to

872
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:49,840
that folder as well
before we can execute to.

873
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:54,840
So update your projects
in the configure session section

874
01:06:55,640 --> 01:07:00,360
and then click on Apply and Save.

875
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:04,040
And now click on Build Now
and let me know if it works this time.

876
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:08,320
Log on why my workspace is empty near you.

877
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:11,920
Execute your report so
and then you click on building.

878
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:23,640
Now. Okay.

879
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:28,280
Do you guys see your output?

880
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:30,000
How many of you see the output?

881
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,080
Like, for example, if I click on this

882
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:36,240
learning, I'm getting

883
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:38,760
good enough

884
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:42,720
votes works

885
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:48,000
branding and new.

886
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,120
Okay, let me change the number of execute
as we are doing.

887
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:52,000
It is

888
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:23,240
let me make the number of executables 50

889
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:25,720
wide.

890
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:28,040
The idea will be

891
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:47,400
the there is one two.

892
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:51,520
Now you guys should be able to execute
your code in parallel still pending.

893
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:53,000
None.

894
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:53,680
There are.

895
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:57,000
There are I there 50 executables now

896
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:00,400
so you guys can execute 50 parallel jobs.

897
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:04,640
So you see Java project Nicolae executing

898
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:09,200
you'll get us better projects
like our project failed

899
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:14,360
and there are a lot of ideal execute those
now I missed that part where.

900
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:16,880
Do I play the code? You just send it

901
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:20,800
lady code.

902
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:22,680
Apply the code

903
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:28,760
like playing music.

904
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:31,040
Where should we put the code? Yeah.

905
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:33,840
So this is where you guys should.

906
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:38,000
Oh, do so.

907
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,280
Go inside your project

908
01:09:50,440 --> 01:10:01,200
and then click on configure.

909
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:04,640
Once you click on configure,
do you guys see this page?

910
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:06,800
Those who are having issues?

911
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:12,240
Do you guys see this page?

912
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:15,000
Now you have to scroll down,

913
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:18,360
scroll down, scroll down,
and then you will see build

914
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:23,560
section, have to click on that.

915
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:28,280
So and this is what you guys will see
if you have not done this before,

916
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:32,840
this is you will see build
and then you will see and build a step.

917
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:35,480
Do guys see this option

918
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:43,680
add, build, step?

919
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:47,120
So you have to click on this
and then you have to click on execute

920
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:54,880
Shell. So

921
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:08,840
click on Execute Shell

922
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:12,680
and then copy and paste code

923
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:17,160
are you go now.

924
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:22,240
So this is a very simple script
in which I am moving to a directory, then

925
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:26,600
compiling the code, using Java compiler
and then running the code using Java.

926
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:27,920
Here.

927
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:32,440
Now click on apply and see.

928
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:32,960
That's it.

929
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:35,760
Now you guys should be able to build
and see your output.

930
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:40,600
How many of you still don't
see your output?

931
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:48,120
Once you click on this console?

932
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:57,760
Are you getting any errors or issues?

933
01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:58,720
What is the error?

934
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:06,360
Send me a screenshot.

935
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:22,360
How many of you are getting errors?

936
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:24,600
I don't see the console.

937
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:28,120
You have to click on build
now before you guys can see the console.

938
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:33,840
And also you have to click in here.

939
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:35,320
So first you have to click on build.

940
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:37,400
Now then click on the

941
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:40,720
output in here

942
01:12:40,800 --> 01:13:17,000
and then you guys will see the console.

943
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:20,520
So you guys see, I am I told you guys,

944
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:23,600
even when I tell you

945
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:28,120
how one times
that you guys have to follow me

946
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:31,400
or still made his on repository

947
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:35,080
new tab dot com lot more simple product

948
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:38,280
and now who didn't push anything
to that repository

949
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:41,560
and he don't see the output
so you see that's why I don't believe

950
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:45,000
why you didn't use my link man

951
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:49,320
then that's why you get that

952
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:54,520
is because you don't follow.

953
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:56,640
Let me tell you the repository now

954
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:39,280
does not.

955
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:40,640
It is mine

956
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:46,120
gone to due to a source second or syntax.

957
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:49,800
So let me show me your project
configuration.

958
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:51,920
Write the execution.

959
01:14:51,920 --> 01:15:03,680
Come on.

960
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:05,920
And you guys click on Execute Shell.

961
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:07,800
Okay.

962
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:11,240
How many of you are getting errors
in Jenkins First?

963
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:11,760
What is this?

964
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:14,560
Jenkins First,
tell me the name of your project

965
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:28,480
then is what is the name of the project?

966
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:31,560
And you see,
I told you then if you have to

967
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:34,640
give, you have to write your name as well
in your project.

968
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:37,840
That's why it is not working, man

969
01:15:39,080 --> 01:16:22,920
Okay, You did it for that project.

970
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:24,960
Come on, man.

971
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:32,560
I was fixing that project for you.

972
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:33,880
Then what is this behavior?

973
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:34,520
And then

974
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:40,760
do you guys want me to revoke

975
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:47,720
the delete privileges as well for you?

976
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:50,520
All right, guys.
So this was a very simple project.

977
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:54,720
We created a very simple

978
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:58,440
Java project we posted to get Hub.

979
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:01,520
Then we created a Jenkins job,

980
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:03,520
which fetched

981
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:05,880
the code from that great repository,

982
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:10,200
compiled the code
and executed that code for us.

983
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:11,320
It's good.

984
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:15,760
It's good, but it's not that good, right?

985
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:18,480
If I have to do it manually

986
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:22,240
by clicking on that link,
then what is the point?

987
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:23,800
This automation, right?

988
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:26,400
So we will go next step in the automation.

989
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:32,280
What we will do, we will now make Jenkins
automatically detect

990
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:36,600
if there are new changes in the code.

991
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:39,960
Jenkins should automatically detect it.

992
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:45,520
It should of first fetch
the fresh board should execute,

993
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:50,240
it should be tested and we should see
the output automatically.

994
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:51,600
Okay, so good.

995
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:52,760
Do that

996
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:57,440
we have to go back to the project?

997
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:00,640
Like for example, this was my project

998
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:07,080
and again we have to click on configure.

999
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:09,200
So I would fix that.

1000
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:14,520
Then in check, if someone is available
in this sports channel.

1001
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:18,880
So once we are inside
the configure project window

1002
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:32,160
and if we go inside, this

1003
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:40,480
builder triggers
a section, do go see this section.

1004
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:43,080
So we have to click on the spool. ACM

1005
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:48,600
and then we have to put

1006
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:54,920
five staff in here.

1007
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:57,360
So what is this pole ACM?

1008
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:59,240
What are these stars?

1009
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:02,960
So Jenkins uses a special language.

1010
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:06,120
It's called cron job.

1011
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:09,960
And using that language, it's

1012
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:13,520
like the regular
that you guys learned in Java.

1013
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:16,280
Yes, we had spaces in between.

1014
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:22,120
It's a special syntax in which you can
almost specify any type of in parallel.

1015
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:29,040
For example, what I am doing in here
right now, I am saying to Jenkins that,

1016
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:32,160
Hey Jenkins, after each minute,

1017
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:35,200
go and check of the repository.

1018
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:40,080
Go and check this repository
for any new changes.

1019
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:44,560
If there are any new changes
to the fresh code

1020
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:49,320
and compile it and execute it. Now

1021
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:54,720
once we specify this cron job,
what does my project

1022
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:58,600
deleting by itself
Can't find it Now by Niccolo.

1023
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:01,280
Someone else is deleting your project now.

1024
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:04,000
I will reveal
all the permissions from you.

1025
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,280
If you guys are doing this,

1026
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,480
you will only be able to see,
Please don't do this.

1027
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:10,560
Don't delete the project.

1028
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:11,720
So for those

1029
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:16,800
okay, it will waste more time

1030
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:18,600
of this class.

1031
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:23,040
So in here I am specifying

1032
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:29,040
doing that after each minute
to go and check of that repository.

1033
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:33,360
If there are new changes,
fetch the fresh code and execute it

1034
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:37,720
automatically
and we can specify any interval.

1035
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:40,800
For example,
let's say your company releases

1036
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:45,200
the new features on every Monday
or any or every Tuesday.

1037
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:49,760
Or maybe let's say you want your record
after each hour

1038
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:53,080
or after every hour,
every minute, every second.

1039
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:58,960
So you guys can specify all of these
things maybe on the first of every month

1040
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:02,680
or maybe in the first week of every month
or maybe first day of every week.

1041
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:06,480
So instead of learning this
all new language,

1042
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:10,400
we can do the same that we did
for the regular expression.

1043
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:13,800
Let's say, for example,
if you have to specify that my code

1044
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:17,400
should execute on every day at 7 p.m.,

1045
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:22,320
this is what you can do.

1046
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:23,880
Cron job to

1047
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:27,640
execute the

1048
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:28,440
code.

1049
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:34,600
Let's say maybe I don't know, every Monday

1050
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:42,360
so you guys can specify

1051
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:45,440
zero zero or both start and then Monday.

1052
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:47,760
So you guys don't
have to learn this language

1053
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:52,240
because it's like it will take next

1054
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:56,200
six months just to learn this language.

1055
01:21:56,200 --> 01:22:04,360
This in 400am on line

1056
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:07,560
one expecting to follow zero weird days.

1057
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:12,320
We have to specify

1058
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:14,160
jenkins as well

1059
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:17,280
so the syntax can be slightly different.

1060
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,120
So instead of this, we should say

1061
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:23,720
Jenkins to execute the code every word.

1062
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:24,440
Okay.

1063
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:28,440
So most probably on the

1064
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:31,280
IRS, I can check, but I will it later.

1065
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:31,920
Okay.

1066
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:38,600
I will check the logs.

1067
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:46,920
Order this one.

1068
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:51,760
So for example, by setting the schedule
period two 1513 and three stars,

1069
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:56,040
you tell Jenkins to schedule
build every day of every month.

1070
01:22:56,040 --> 01:23:01,040
So if we go and specify that in here.

1071
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:06,280
So it also tells you spreads
load evenly by using edge three.

1072
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:10,320
So it's a better syntax
if we use that too, but we're

1073
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:14,280
have so this is Jenkins is sending you

1074
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:19,720
that this code should be executed
last on Thursday

1075
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:23,160
March 24 at this time

1076
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:28,360
and the next
it will be executed on Friday, March 25th.

1077
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:29,600
At this time.

1078
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:34,800
So tomorrow you guys can specify
maybe you want to execute it

1079
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:39,600
on the next month, next year,
every 15 days or something like that.

1080
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:42,360
So all the code,
instead of learning these dogs,

1081
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:45,600
you guys can Google it
and can most probably like

1082
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:49,080
you guys will find the answer
on Straggler Flow

1083
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:53,680
somewhere else.

1084
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:58,520
So let's try the one minute thing
so that we can test it quickly.

1085
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:01,800
So I am specifying five stars.

1086
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:04,960
How do we get

1087
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:09,200
commands on their

1088
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:13,800
SO do you guys see

1089
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:16,200
this would have last executed on

1090
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:20,120
March 21st, blah blah blah
and we execute this.

1091
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:23,120
So if we specify a five stars,

1092
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:26,520
it should execute after each minute.

1093
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:30,480
So now, after specifying these five

1094
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:33,160
stars, don't
do anything, click on Apply and Save

1095
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:39,120
and observe this.

1096
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:41,040
Guys observe this.

1097
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:43,320
I go inside my project

1098
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:49,520
and I change the code maybe from 10 to 5

1099
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:52,720
in here clicking on

1100
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:56,080
Give the option all yes policy
and then mute.

1101
01:24:56,680 --> 01:25:06,920
So if I change the record
and if I push it.

1102
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:13,680
So if I go in here, no,

1103
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:17,120
I'm committed.

1104
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:21,080
So don't wait and push.

1105
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:24,440
So are you guys done three

1106
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:28,160
putting those five stars
because all of your projects

1107
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:31,360
will be executed
automatically after I push this.

1108
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,080
Okay Observe this, guys.

1109
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:41,640
I put I say commit and push.

1110
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:44,160
The code has been pushed.

1111
01:25:44,160 --> 01:25:48,440
Let me check
if we see that on GitHub. Yes.

1112
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:50,600
12 seconds ago.

1113
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:56,880
And now you see it automatically scheduled
the build number five.

1114
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:58,080
I didn't click build it.

1115
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:01,120
Now, do you guys see that
all of your projects,

1116
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:04,800
they are started automatically.

1117
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:07,680
So as a developer or as a tester,

1118
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:11,160
we don't need to do any of the things.

1119
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:14,320
We will develop the code once

1120
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:17,680
code looks good, once the task
this is looks good,

1121
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:23,480
we just need to push the code
and the rest of the things will be done

1122
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:26,440
automatically by Jenkins
compiling the code,

1123
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:31,240
checking for the errors, running
that code, executing all of their test.

1124
01:26:31,240 --> 01:26:33,680
This is everything will be done
by Jenkins.

1125
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:35,440
Just need to push your code.

1126
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:41,200
And you guys can also do this your builds

1127
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:44,720
and you will be working on larger
applications. It

1128
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:50,080
might take hours to complete so you don't
need to sit in front of your computer.

1129
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:52,560
You can configure Jenkins.

1130
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:55,520
Jenkins We will, we will execute

1131
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:58,440
all the code
will fetch the code automatically

1132
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:04,040
and if you get any errors, it will also
it can also send you an email there.

1133
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:10,080
Tasker I was executing a project
and while executing all the test

1134
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:11,120
cases, maybe, I don't know,

1135
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:14,760
let's say all the desk is his boss
or maybe some best guess is failed.

1136
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:16,440
This this was the issue.

1137
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:22,280
This is this was the error.

1138
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:24,800
We have to delete package name
before pushing always.

1139
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:26,480
No, no, not always. You just.

1140
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:31,200
Well I am just doing it so that the code,
the script looks simpler.

1141
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:33,920
No, but we don't need to delete anything.

1142
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:35,880
We can write any script or anything.

1143
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:38,160
I'm just making it simple.

1144
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:41,720
So now let's try to push the project.

1145
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:44,520
Or the MAVEN project. Right. That's it.

1146
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:48,840
That is the actual thing
that you guys will be working with.

1147
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:50,640
This was a very simple project.

1148
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:54,040
Now let's move to the actual thing,
the things that you guys will be doing.

1149
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:56,280
Okay, so you guys understand now?

1150
01:27:57,320 --> 01:27:59,680
Jenkins Once we make

1151
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:03,480
changes, it
fetches the code from your local computer

1152
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:06,240
right after reporting,
it will be pushed to the gear tab.

1153
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:09,880
And from that tab everything else.

1154
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:12,120
After that, they'll pushing your code

1155
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:15,000
to the production
server will be taken care of by Jenkins.

1156
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:21,080
I don't have number five.

1157
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:22,440
It's fine.

1158
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:27,560
You don't have number five
because you execute your code 18 times.

1159
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:30,200
Now, how can you have number five?

1160
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:33,360
Come on guys,
you are about to leave Syntax

1161
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:40,520
a go back

1162
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:44,160
and you will see number five as well,
which

1163
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:53,280
do you guys want to have a break before
we start with the actual things, maybe

1164
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:56,360
fix your issue with if you are a guy,
if you are getting any issues

1165
01:28:56,360 --> 01:29:02,080
or anything.

1166
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:03,840
Okay, guys, please fix your issues.

1167
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:05,480
Posting Discord Channel.

1168
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:09,760
There is no one available in this port
channel, so expect that other solutions

1169
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:10,880
will help you out.

1170
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:13,560
And I will take rest for 15 minutes
and we'll see you

1171
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:23,200
after that.

1172
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:25,920
Can anyone help? No, I'm super,
super tired.

1173
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:27,120
Help each of the base

1174
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:31,560
graduation

1175
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:38,440
should be configure.

1176
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:38,760
Okay.

1177
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,880
So most of our it is going

1178
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:48,600
after each minute,
but because there are no non new changes,

1179
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:51,720
that's why
it is not executing it again and again.

1180
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,480
We didn't say a Jenkins to execute it
again and again again

1181
01:29:55,480 --> 01:29:59,160
we said that
hey Jenkins, if there are new changes

1182
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:03,000
then execute the code but keep on checking

1183
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,520
after each minute, after every minute.

1184
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:09,960
That's what we said.

1185
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:12,200
Can you spend one more time
the Blade Command.

1186
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:16,040
So the first line is we are moving

1187
01:30:16,040 --> 01:30:20,400
to this repository, which is bombs.

1188
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:22,000
I saw second person bags.

1189
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:26,800
So the folder in which we are moving
with the help of the command,

1190
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:32,520
then we are compiling the file main door
Java inside that repository

1191
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:37,920
and then we are executing that code
with the help of Java application.

1192
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:39,320
Sebastian Good. Now

1193
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:53,720
show me

1194
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:59,240
you guys can see my configurations,
You guys can also see my configurations.

1195
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:07,200
Then if you can see me,
see it on your own,

1196
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:11,960
these are my configurations.

1197
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:13,120
All I see them. Good stuff.

1198
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:13,600
That's it.

1199
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:15,720
Then click on Appliances next

1200
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:24,480
work line is same.

1201
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:36,720
Are we on break? Yes.

1202
01:31:36,720 --> 01:45:21,240
I will be back in 2 minutes, guys.

1203
01:45:21,240 --> 01:45:30,360
I hope you guys are back.

1204
01:45:30,360 --> 01:45:33,920
So everyone is good now.

1205
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:34,720
All right.

1206
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:38,320
So you guys see that
the code is automatically fetched

1207
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:42,040
and as is executed by Jenkins.

1208
01:45:42,040 --> 01:45:46,920
And so the next thing you guys will
be doing on your jobs is related to the

1209
01:45:47,480 --> 01:45:49,240
movement project.

1210
01:45:49,240 --> 01:45:52,400
So almost everyone is good except El-Enany

1211
01:45:54,120 --> 01:45:57,720
and Simple Java Project. One

1212
01:45:57,720 --> 01:45:58,320
elevator.

1213
01:45:58,320 --> 01:46:00,840
What what are the issues? You are?

1214
01:46:00,840 --> 01:46:03,440
We are two saved.

1215
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:08,120
That is.

1216
01:46:08,120 --> 01:46:10,960
And this morning, best of all, you.

1217
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:29,800
All of you guys will Good.

1218
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:35,280
It should be
Java Sea, not Java, but Lightsail

1219
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:38,280
will now

1220
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:49,080
you are good.

1221
01:46:49,080 --> 01:46:51,640
Now is there anyone else
who is getting any issues?

1222
01:46:52,680 --> 01:46:53,760
We are to see it.

1223
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:56,400
That is the that it is updating.

1224
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:59,800
So once we go back

1225
01:47:01,640 --> 01:47:02,360
in here.

1226
01:47:02,360 --> 01:47:05,160
So this is the project we are all in here.

1227
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:09,000
So you you will,
you will see that the build will trigger

1228
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:12,680
automatically in here
and you can also delete from the numbers

1229
01:47:12,680 --> 01:47:16,400
and the date and time as the neck
and new build was triggered.

1230
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:23,280
Indeed, when the changes were pushed.

1231
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:27,920
And so guys is Jenkins the way to automate
without saying the browser

1232
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:29,680
opening and going through the commission?

1233
01:47:29,680 --> 01:47:32,160
Yes that's what we will do next.

1234
01:47:32,160 --> 01:47:36,560
What we will do now.

1235
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:39,800
So click on new item and

1236
01:47:41,120 --> 01:47:44,280
MAVEN project us

1237
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:48,480
the give your names and the next time
initial announcement. But

1238
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:52,760
and this time click on MAVEN project
and start

1239
01:47:52,800 --> 01:48:00,760
instead of freestyle project.

1240
01:48:00,760 --> 01:48:01,520
Are you guys done?

1241
01:48:01,520 --> 01:48:05,040
Let me know if someone is still doing it

1242
01:48:12,760 --> 01:48:15,000
then this time Maven project

1243
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,400
give it a name and and your name

1244
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:23,160
or. Or use this name someone already.

1245
01:48:23,640 --> 01:48:25,200
Guys. Come on guys. Why?

1246
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:36,200
Why are you using my same
same name as mine?

1247
01:48:36,200 --> 01:48:42,600
Please use your name.

1248
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:43,040
Come on.

1249
01:48:43,040 --> 01:48:46,760
That is five years of experience

1250
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:54,560
and this is what you guys will do.

1251
01:48:54,560 --> 01:49:00,120
So make sure you have your own project,
okay?

1252
01:49:00,120 --> 01:49:04,200
Now we will make some changes
in the MAVEN project

1253
01:49:04,200 --> 01:49:07,200
and the changes

1254
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:10,360
I have made those changes already,
but I will tell you

1255
01:49:10,360 --> 01:49:14,640
what are those changes
and why we why I have made those changes.

1256
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:18,520
So the first change
that I did in your project

1257
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:21,720
was to because

1258
01:49:21,720 --> 01:49:24,400
on servers on Jenkins, there are no

1259
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:29,320
yes, there are browsers,
but they are like they don't have screens.

1260
01:49:29,480 --> 01:49:34,080
We don't see the outputs of browsers or
videos that we play on the servers, right?

1261
01:49:34,440 --> 01:49:38,240
Unless we are connected to the server
from our computers.

1262
01:49:38,240 --> 01:49:42,520
So what we do instead of like for example,

1263
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:45,680
this is what happened,
what what you guys have been doing allow

1264
01:49:58,080 --> 01:50:01,200
the let's for example
on your local computers let's say,

1265
01:50:01,200 --> 01:50:05,440
I don't know, maybe if I have to
the smoke test I will click on this

1266
01:50:05,880 --> 01:50:12,840
run button, then the code will be compiled

1267
01:50:12,840 --> 01:50:16,880
and the execution will start right
and it will open a browser

1268
01:50:17,960 --> 01:50:20,520
on come to the right

1269
01:50:20,520 --> 01:50:26,280
and I will see the actual visual as well
how the test cases are being executed.

1270
01:50:27,560 --> 01:50:28,720
But on Jenkins, we

1271
01:50:28,720 --> 01:50:32,320
don't need it, right, because that
that's the whole purpose of Jenkins.

1272
01:50:32,640 --> 01:50:36,440
We want to start the execution
automatically.

1273
01:50:36,440 --> 01:50:37,240
We want to last.

1274
01:50:37,240 --> 01:50:38,080
We want to sleep,

1275
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:42,040
we want to it and we want
we are interested in the end results.

1276
01:50:42,040 --> 01:50:46,160
Now we have done all the debugging,
testing and everything on our local

1277
01:50:46,160 --> 01:50:50,920
computers, everything is working fine
and now we are automating it right?

1278
01:50:51,120 --> 01:50:55,200
We are not right now
fixing the errors in test scenarios.

1279
01:50:55,200 --> 01:50:56,160
Everything is done.

1280
01:50:56,160 --> 01:50:59,200
We are now moving that well,
testing the code.

1281
01:51:00,240 --> 01:51:02,400
Yes that that is the had left browser.

1282
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:04,800
Do that for now.

1283
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:09,120
We don't need to see how to disable
this chrome opening.

1284
01:51:09,120 --> 01:51:11,720
This is how we disable it

1285
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:14,120
inside. Go inside. Your command matters

1286
01:51:15,240 --> 01:51:18,000
now you guys can follow on your own.

1287
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,440
You can make changes to your project

1288
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:26,400
or I will push these changes
to the Cucumber framework.

1289
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:29,440
Batch 11 repository
and you guys can copy paste.

1290
01:51:29,440 --> 01:51:31,000
From there.

1291
01:51:31,320 --> 01:51:36,560
I will suggest you to just watch me
and then maybe later on you can follow me

1292
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:39,840
if you are not that fast or good enough

1293
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:43,800
to make changes and all that.

1294
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:47,440
So if I don't want to see that
browser opening,

1295
01:51:48,080 --> 01:51:50,320
there is this class that is called

1296
01:51:52,160 --> 01:51:53,080
Chrome option.

1297
01:51:53,080 --> 01:51:55,000
So we have to create the objects.

1298
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:59,440
I'm commenting on the simple code
in which we create the in which we created

1299
01:51:59,440 --> 01:52:03,240
the object of chrome driver
and we set up it and then we assign

1300
01:52:03,240 --> 01:52:04,800
it to the driver variable.

1301
01:52:06,320 --> 01:52:08,080
Now I am creating an

1302
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:11,600
object of the Chrome option class
and I can

1303
01:52:12,160 --> 01:52:16,920
the properties for the Chrome browser
using this class.

1304
01:52:16,920 --> 01:52:19,520
So for example,
there is this property that is called

1305
01:52:19,960 --> 01:52:22,920
headless.

1306
01:52:22,920 --> 01:52:24,400
Yes, yes.

1307
01:52:24,400 --> 01:52:28,240
We're going to
and have this headless property.

1308
01:52:28,640 --> 01:52:32,400
Once I have set up,
I am forcing those options.

1309
01:52:33,080 --> 01:52:35,520
So the constructor of Chrome Driver

1310
01:52:36,080 --> 01:52:38,920
and once I do that guys,
once I do that, I'm done this.

1311
01:52:39,800 --> 01:52:41,960
If I now

1312
01:52:41,960 --> 01:52:44,120
go and and execute,

1313
01:52:44,120 --> 01:52:50,840
let's add the smoke.

1314
01:52:50,840 --> 01:52:51,800
You guys will see.

1315
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:53,920
Everything will happen.

1316
01:52:54,160 --> 01:52:56,200
All the is will be executed.

1317
01:52:56,200 --> 01:52:58,600
But no will be open.

1318
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:01,640
You see when user did you see.

1319
01:53:01,800 --> 01:53:06,400
All the steps are executing right now
but no browser is open right now.

1320
01:53:06,640 --> 01:53:10,400
Do you guys see the same effects
on your computers now as

1321
01:53:12,920 --> 01:53:16,280
command of the existing code

1322
01:53:16,280 --> 01:53:18,400
inside your common methods?

1323
01:53:18,840 --> 01:53:22,200
And replace
or replace that code with quote

1324
01:53:24,280 --> 01:53:27,720
and this time, yes,
all of your test cases should be executed,

1325
01:53:27,720 --> 01:53:32,040
but you should not see Chrome
browser opening on your computers.

1326
01:53:32,640 --> 01:53:36,320
You give me a thumbs up once you guys get

1327
01:53:36,360 --> 01:53:38,160
the same readers

1328
01:54:05,400 --> 01:54:06,960
same but failed.

1329
01:54:06,960 --> 01:54:10,760
I so you can use my my project

1330
01:54:10,760 --> 01:54:13,200
and you can use my failing
is something different.

1331
01:54:13,200 --> 01:54:15,360
Maybe your best guess is failing.

1332
01:54:16,120 --> 01:54:29,880
Just make sure that the browser
is not opening this time.

1333
01:54:29,880 --> 01:54:31,720
So let me push.

1334
01:54:31,720 --> 01:54:33,360
This changes

1335
01:54:37,360 --> 01:54:40,080
and let's

1336
01:54:44,800 --> 01:54:50,120
let me share the link with you.

1337
01:54:50,120 --> 01:54:53,080
So this is the riposte
in which I am making changes. Nice.

1338
01:54:53,080 --> 01:54:58,200
Those who are unable to follow me
or are getting any issues on your projects

1339
01:54:58,200 --> 01:55:05,880
Please use this in this project.

1340
01:55:05,880 --> 01:55:11,160
So this I'm now back to
the MAVEN project job in here

1341
01:55:13,120 --> 01:55:14,960
I go to

1342
01:55:14,960 --> 01:55:18,840
source code management,
I click on Gate and then paste this.

1343
01:55:18,840 --> 01:55:20,000
You are all

1344
01:55:26,720 --> 01:55:29,520
so this time
because we created in MAVEN project.

1345
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:34,400
If you go inside of the build section,
you guys should see the bombed out

1346
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:37,160
XAML automatically popped up

1347
01:55:38,040 --> 01:55:40,800
and you guys should see this new

1348
01:55:42,600 --> 01:55:43,880
X box

1349
01:55:43,880 --> 01:55:49,200
that says Golden Options.

1350
01:55:49,200 --> 01:55:51,760
Do you guys see this option

1351
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:33,160
window?

1352
01:56:33,240 --> 01:56:51,480
Once all of you are done?

1353
01:56:51,480 --> 01:56:56,720
So if you are unable to follow me
because we have to cover more stuff,

1354
01:56:57,120 --> 01:56:59,440
you can do the practice later on

1355
01:56:59,880 --> 01:57:02,480
and you can just watch the video
right now.

1356
01:57:03,080 --> 01:57:06,440
Since the desktop does not open,
the browser will still screenshot

1357
01:57:06,680 --> 01:57:08,160
everything will be happened.

1358
01:57:08,160 --> 01:57:12,560
Mohammad All the features
screenshot has not to do nothing

1359
01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:15,760
to do with the things I like opening
the browser.

1360
01:57:15,760 --> 01:57:18,240
It is done
automatically behind the scenes,

1361
01:57:18,240 --> 01:57:20,880
even if you minimize your browser
during the test.

1362
01:57:20,920 --> 01:57:23,240
This application
still these screenshots will be taken

1363
01:57:28,560 --> 01:57:34,040
so do you guys see this bomb drop?

1364
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:35,080
Example

1365
01:57:35,600 --> 01:57:38,120
Now to execute the Runners

1366
01:57:39,240 --> 01:57:42,160
project, we have different parameters,

1367
01:57:42,160 --> 01:57:45,240
so to execute those runners
we have to write this command.

1368
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:47,040
It is built in.

1369
01:57:47,040 --> 01:57:49,920
You guys know how to execute
MAVEN projects

1370
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:54,720
with command line.

1371
01:57:54,720 --> 01:57:57,240
So you guys are already familiar
with this command, right?

1372
01:57:57,880 --> 01:58:00,280
Been installed

1373
01:58:00,280 --> 01:58:01,000
right

1374
01:58:02,360 --> 01:58:04,800
minus D is equal to test

1375
01:58:05,200 --> 01:58:08,560
and then now we have to specify the runner

1376
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:14,600
that we want.

1377
01:58:14,600 --> 01:58:14,960
Right?

1378
01:58:15,120 --> 01:58:18,120
So let's say, for example,
I want to execute this smoke

1379
01:58:20,680 --> 01:58:23,360
machine, send you this to install

1380
01:58:26,400 --> 01:58:27,920
inside the golden option.

1381
01:58:27,920 --> 01:58:28,960
Guys, write this.

1382
01:58:28,960 --> 01:58:29,360
Come on.

1383
01:58:29,360 --> 01:58:30,440
As it was

1384
01:58:40,440 --> 01:58:41,160
and let me know

1385
01:58:41,160 --> 01:58:55,440
what you guys are done.

1386
01:58:55,440 --> 01:58:59,280
And now click on apply

1387
01:58:59,280 --> 01:59:02,600
and yeah,

1388
01:59:03,200 --> 01:59:08,800
and click on the.

1389
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:17,600
So right now we will see all the execution
from this so we can control output.

1390
01:59:17,600 --> 01:59:21,680
So for faster to effect
all the required dependencies,

1391
01:59:22,320 --> 01:59:25,440
then it will set up your project
and then it will execute

1392
01:59:25,480 --> 01:59:39,360
execution.

1393
01:59:39,360 --> 01:59:43,040
So guys,
can you please not take one building out?

1394
01:59:43,040 --> 01:59:44,920
But I think you have already done there.

1395
01:59:44,920 --> 01:59:49,800
So it might take some time now
because all, all of you are fetching

1396
01:59:50,160 --> 01:59:55,440
all of your projects
and patching this thing now.

1397
01:59:55,440 --> 02:00:02,880
Okay, stop it now. So

1398
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:07,880
yes, you guys, can

1399
02:00:07,880 --> 02:00:10,680
I give you the privilege
to cancel something

1400
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:35,280
so maybe you guys can cancel?

1401
02:00:35,280 --> 02:00:36,480
Yes, it's fine. Finished?

1402
02:00:36,480 --> 02:00:52,440
Almost.

1403
02:00:52,440 --> 02:00:55,000
Silva,
please don't send me the same logic.

1404
02:00:55,760 --> 02:00:58,400
My poor server and not handle

1405
02:00:58,400 --> 02:01:01,520
50 plus projects all completed.

1406
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:02,600
Build the sandbox.

1407
02:01:02,600 --> 02:01:03,840
It's fine.

1408
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:06,040
It's.

1409
02:01:06,040 --> 02:01:07,560
I didn't build it.

1410
02:01:07,560 --> 02:01:10,320
I didn't configure it to be super,
super fast

1411
02:01:10,920 --> 02:01:13,880
because it cost law and

1412
02:01:16,720 --> 02:01:18,520
I think your signal's

1413
02:01:18,960 --> 02:01:19,640
funding.

1414
02:01:21,120 --> 02:01:22,360
So, guys, this server is

1415
02:01:22,360 --> 02:01:25,800
set up for you
to have some lightweight practice,

1416
02:01:25,800 --> 02:01:28,880
and that's why we set up the server

1417
02:01:28,880 --> 02:01:32,080
to have like only four gigabytes of.

1418
02:01:32,080 --> 02:01:32,680
Right. Okay.

1419
02:01:32,680 --> 02:01:35,480
So on your jobs,
you guys will be having much better.

1420
02:01:35,480 --> 02:01:38,880
So it's fine for now.

1421
02:01:38,880 --> 02:01:42,160
Hopefully it's not going to be trashed
before we understand the concepts of

1422
02:01:43,240 --> 02:01:47,400
No, no, you guys will see the output.

1423
02:01:47,400 --> 02:01:49,200
And let me just give me one moment.

1424
02:01:49,200 --> 02:01:54,240
I recorded already.

1425
02:01:54,240 --> 02:01:56,360
I will miss you so good.
I will miss you guys guys.

1426
02:01:56,480 --> 02:01:58,200
But I'm working on with batch.

1427
02:01:58,200 --> 02:02:02,040
Well, they are not that funny right now,
but I think I will make them funny.

1428
02:02:03,480 --> 02:02:08,480
I So the smoke is being

1429
02:02:08,480 --> 02:02:21,160
is running right now.

1430
02:02:21,160 --> 02:02:24,080
Maybe the morning is bad today.

1431
02:02:24,080 --> 02:02:26,280
How many students are there?

1432
02:02:26,280 --> 02:02:31,320
There are 177 students in Best Barstow.

1433
02:02:32,560 --> 02:02:37,120
If they don't laugh at your dogs,
they need to see the doctor.

1434
02:02:37,120 --> 02:02:38,160
Then they do laugh.

1435
02:02:38,160 --> 02:02:41,280
But because there are
a lot of the lot of students,

1436
02:02:41,840 --> 02:02:45,160
that's why they kind of have this issue.

1437
02:02:45,880 --> 02:02:48,760
The management is not that good.

1438
02:02:48,760 --> 02:02:51,360
So Chrome driver was successfully started

1439
02:02:51,360 --> 02:02:54,680
and and there
was two or three classes. The

1440
02:02:56,560 --> 02:02:58,480
I don't know

1441
02:02:58,480 --> 02:03:02,520
the men were testing class
I guess they they had some kind of issues

1442
02:03:02,520 --> 02:03:07,520
so they didn't feel that good
but I hope they are good now.

1443
02:03:07,680 --> 02:03:08,560
How many students?

1444
02:03:08,560 --> 02:03:13,920
I heard there's like 200 in the start
there were like 200 or ten I guess

1445
02:03:14,280 --> 02:03:18,120
then or five students.

1446
02:03:18,120 --> 02:03:20,200
And right now 177.

1447
02:03:20,200 --> 02:03:21,880
So these these are the numbers.

1448
02:03:21,880 --> 02:03:24,240
These weren't some of the seven.
They will stick at the end.

1449
02:03:24,360 --> 02:03:28,320
So they are almost done with Java
for the classes remaining with Java,

1450
02:03:28,320 --> 02:03:33,360
they have already started Selenium,
so maybe two or 2.5 months

1451
02:03:33,360 --> 02:03:34,320
they will be

1452
02:03:42,800 --> 02:03:45,200
by new dude and pencil, you know,

1453
02:03:45,200 --> 02:03:48,240
they can see it.

1454
02:03:48,240 --> 02:03:51,520
You see one, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight.

1455
02:03:52,160 --> 02:04:13,280
So let me, let me cancel it.

1456
02:04:13,280 --> 02:04:16,000
Okay. So the best guess is being executed
right now.

1457
02:04:16,040 --> 02:04:19,320
The best bars, they are going to use it
in successfully logged in.

1458
02:04:19,680 --> 02:04:22,720
So you see all the test cases
they are executing,

1459
02:04:23,160 --> 02:04:26,160
but we don't see any browser
or something like that.

1460
02:04:26,160 --> 02:04:28,720
Right.

1461
02:04:28,720 --> 02:04:30,880
They will do later
when no one else is online

1462
02:04:35,960 --> 02:04:37,560
and blended successfully.

1463
02:04:37,560 --> 02:04:40,040
So we see all the output in here. Okay

1464
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,720
guys,
maybe you can follow the video later,

1465
02:04:45,040 --> 02:04:47,800
but try to just watch, try to just

1466
02:04:48,960 --> 02:04:51,840
see what I am doing
and then maybe you guys can do it in

1467
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:55,400
in your free time
on some new pencil. Mine.

1468
02:04:55,400 --> 02:04:56,040
I don't know.

1469
02:04:56,040 --> 02:05:12,600
I just canceled randomly.

1470
02:05:12,600 --> 02:05:14,400
Had to make a moves.

1471
02:05:14,400 --> 02:05:16,160
So you see, I see a success.

1472
02:05:16,160 --> 02:05:18,320
Everything that you did, all the best.

1473
02:05:18,320 --> 02:05:20,520
This is boss, and everything looks good.

1474
02:05:20,520 --> 02:05:24,120
But then if I go back to project.

1475
02:05:24,120 --> 02:05:25,960
Does anyone make fun of you?

1476
02:05:25,960 --> 02:05:29,520
Only a few students
feel, Feel means or not

1477
02:05:29,520 --> 02:05:33,480
that someone is messing with.

1478
02:05:33,480 --> 02:05:35,280
I got finished unstable.

1479
02:05:35,280 --> 02:05:37,920
So this is how the MAVEN projects are. Go.

1480
02:05:38,400 --> 02:05:44,960
And if we go back
and if we click on configure,

1481
02:05:44,960 --> 02:05:48,680
you guys know about the cucumber
reports, right?

1482
02:05:49,120 --> 02:05:53,960
We can also generate those reports
on on Jenkins.

1483
02:05:53,960 --> 02:05:58,000
For example,
if I go inside the boss to build

1484
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:03,000
actions,

1485
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,920
the fourth option is cucumber reports.

1486
02:06:06,360 --> 02:06:07,600
If I click on that

1487
02:06:08,760 --> 02:06:11,560
and click on Advance

1488
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:16,760
in here, I can specify the pattern.

1489
02:06:16,760 --> 02:06:17,520
For example,

1490
02:06:17,520 --> 02:06:21,880
there can be multiple JSON files
from which your report is being generated.

1491
02:06:21,920 --> 02:06:25,400
So I can specify right now
I am saying, Hey Jenkins,

1492
02:06:26,400 --> 02:06:29,280
hey, whatever
the plugin is, that is the report.

1493
02:06:29,280 --> 02:06:32,040
I think it's called Cucumber Report
generating plug in.

1494
02:06:32,040 --> 02:06:35,880
So right now I'm saying don't care
about any of the folders

1495
02:06:37,080 --> 02:06:40,360
and don't care about any of the subfolders
inside.

1496
02:06:40,400 --> 02:06:41,600
Inside of those folders.

1497
02:06:41,600 --> 02:06:46,720
Just look for the file
that ends with the dot JSON extension.

1498
02:06:47,200 --> 02:06:49,800
If you find that file leak that

1499
02:06:50,240 --> 02:06:53,280
and generate a report report
using that file.

1500
02:06:53,520 --> 02:06:57,080
Okay.

1501
02:06:57,080 --> 02:07:00,160
And you guys can add
more possible actions.

1502
02:07:00,160 --> 02:07:04,800
For example, if you want to build
other projects when this project is done

1503
02:07:05,240 --> 02:07:07,800
or if you want to publish things, or

1504
02:07:07,800 --> 02:07:11,160
maybe if you want to trigger
other projects.

1505
02:07:11,760 --> 02:07:18,840
And there is one more thing,

1506
02:07:18,840 --> 02:07:22,400
I can also set up email notifications.

1507
02:07:22,400 --> 02:07:26,280
For example, if the desk this is a pass
or failed, I will get an image.

1508
02:07:26,280 --> 02:07:27,440
So let me try that.

1509
02:07:27,440 --> 02:07:31,640
Last time I allowed
these folders to do that,

1510
02:07:32,160 --> 02:07:35,360
they assigned the presence of to

1511
02:07:36,640 --> 02:07:39,000
two other
email addresses and Google blocked us.

1512
02:07:39,840 --> 02:07:45,520
So I disable that.

1513
02:07:47,160 --> 02:07:49,600
So we can specify the emails in here

1514
02:07:50,640 --> 02:07:53,760
and I can just show you
how the emails will look like.

1515
02:07:53,760 --> 02:08:06,960
So for example,
you guys will get an email like this.

1516
02:08:06,960 --> 02:08:16,360
No, what was my email?

1517
02:08:16,360 --> 02:08:20,520
I think this one. Yes.

1518
02:08:22,160 --> 02:08:24,320
So all the things that

1519
02:08:26,440 --> 02:08:28,000
yes, we need to build again.

1520
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:32,720
So you see
this was telling us the testing pipeline.

1521
02:08:32,720 --> 02:08:36,040
So Jenkins sends you an email containing

1522
02:08:36,040 --> 02:08:39,480
all the information
that you see on your console output.

1523
02:08:39,920 --> 02:08:43,320
It sends
you all that output inside an email.

1524
02:08:43,680 --> 02:08:47,880
And from that email you can check
if the desk gives you that pass

1525
02:08:47,880 --> 02:08:50,400
fail divide. They are fairly wide.
They are pass.

1526
02:08:50,800 --> 02:08:54,040
So you really get these kind of emails
one month's considered.

1527
02:08:54,120 --> 02:08:57,400
Okay, so if I click on to now

1528
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,400
not launch this one.

1529
02:09:01,680 --> 02:09:03,560
Yes this one actually.

1530
02:09:03,640 --> 02:09:06,480
So the second build build has triggered

1531
02:09:12,440 --> 02:09:15,480
guys can you please stop your products

1532
02:09:16,080 --> 02:09:20,280
from then you cancel the execution
so that we can quickly see that.

1533
02:09:20,760 --> 02:09:25,040
Otherwise it will take a lot of time.

1534
02:09:25,040 --> 02:09:28,120
No, I can also cancel your Dennis.

1535
02:09:28,120 --> 02:09:31,960
I can cancel all of your projects
plus delete all of your projects

1536
02:09:31,960 --> 02:09:36,000
plus block you from log in to Jenkins.

1537
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:43,560
So can you please cooperate with me?

1538
02:09:43,560 --> 02:09:44,640
Why are you building again?

1539
02:09:44,640 --> 02:09:54,200
To show you how the report looks like.

1540
02:09:54,200 --> 02:09:59,800
So the project has been built,
and if I go back to the project now,

1541
02:09:59,800 --> 02:10:03,000
this time
you guys will see this report option

1542
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:06,160
as well if I click on that.

1543
02:10:06,160 --> 02:10:09,080
So the same report that you guys see
on your Web,

1544
02:10:09,080 --> 02:10:11,920
you guys will see
all those reports in here as well.

1545
02:10:12,360 --> 02:10:15,560
You can also configure Jenkins
to send these reports

1546
02:10:15,560 --> 02:10:19,800
to any of the images for your managers.

1547
02:10:19,800 --> 02:10:21,760
All do their best years of yourself,
right?

1548
02:10:21,760 --> 02:10:24,440
So I can go add employees.

1549
02:10:24,440 --> 02:10:28,680
I can see 11 best bars, how much time
they took and how everything.

1550
02:10:28,680 --> 02:10:34,440
Later you will tell us what is freestyling
job three side jobs mean that

1551
02:10:34,440 --> 02:10:39,280
whatever you want to do with that project,
you can write your custom scripts alone.

1552
02:10:39,280 --> 02:10:42,440
Now that project can be anything.

1553
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:46,600
When we create a MAVEN
project, Jenkins starts

1554
02:10:46,600 --> 02:10:49,840
automatically
a lot of things for us, for example,

1555
02:10:51,400 --> 02:10:53,880
and MAVEN
project management projects then.

1556
02:10:54,320 --> 02:10:58,080
So it will, for example,
fetch the bomb file automatically.

1557
02:10:58,080 --> 02:11:00,760
It will set up all the directories
automatically.

1558
02:11:00,960 --> 02:11:04,400
It will do a lot of things
automatically when we create a project.

1559
02:11:04,640 --> 02:11:08,480
But if we create a ceasefire project,
none of this will be done for us.

1560
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,840
So freestyle
projects are like, for example,

1561
02:11:11,840 --> 02:11:15,520
if you are using your custom builder
tools, custom scripts and all that, most

1562
02:11:15,520 --> 02:11:19,240
probably 99% of the time on your jobs,

1563
02:11:19,440 --> 02:11:27,360
you will use MAVEN projects
or GRADLE projects.

1564
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:32,840
So this is how we can generate reports,
We can execute MAVEN projects,

1565
02:11:32,840 --> 02:11:37,760
we can build the trigger, we can build the
we can trigger the builds automatically.

1566
02:11:38,160 --> 02:11:43,720
Now, there is one more thing
that every time we execute discord,

1567
02:11:43,720 --> 02:11:47,800
we have to go inside the configure.

1568
02:11:47,800 --> 02:11:51,600
Let's say this time
I want to execute the regression

1569
02:11:52,800 --> 02:11:55,360
so I have to manually go and change

1570
02:11:55,360 --> 02:11:58,840
the configuration inside in on jobs,
you will not

1571
02:11:58,840 --> 02:12:01,160
maybe want to give out

1572
02:12:02,680 --> 02:12:04,440
anyone everyone

1573
02:12:04,440 --> 02:12:07,680
the access of this configure tab.

1574
02:12:07,680 --> 02:12:11,400
So how do, how can they specify this?

1575
02:12:11,400 --> 02:12:16,520
The the test where they want to run
without messing up your configuration?

1576
02:12:16,520 --> 02:12:19,400
So there is this option

1577
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
that we can select.

1578
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:26,960
It is called this
if says this project is parameterized

1579
02:12:27,080 --> 02:12:32,040
so we can pass the parameters
to this project while running

1580
02:12:32,520 --> 02:12:34,960
instead of changing things at run

1581
02:12:35,480 --> 02:12:38,160
before running during the configuration.

1582
02:12:38,160 --> 02:12:39,920
So we don't want to share.

1583
02:12:39,920 --> 02:12:42,600
We don't want anyone, everyone

1584
02:12:42,600 --> 02:12:46,160
to have access
to this configuration tab as well.

1585
02:12:46,160 --> 02:12:48,120
We can limit that as that.

1586
02:12:48,120 --> 02:12:51,840
And if limit that,
we should have a mechanism to post

1587
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:54,960
external information
to the project to during execution.

1588
02:12:54,960 --> 02:12:57,680
So we can also do that
with the help of parameters.

1589
02:12:58,200 --> 02:13:00,080
So for example,
if I click on this project,

1590
02:13:00,080 --> 02:13:04,240
this parameter, identify
people on parameter and let's say maybe

1591
02:13:05,920 --> 02:13:09,400
let's create a twice parameter.

1592
02:13:09,400 --> 02:13:09,760
Okay?

1593
02:13:10,520 --> 02:13:13,640
So let's say

1594
02:13:15,720 --> 02:13:17,560
let's call it runners.

1595
02:13:17,560 --> 02:13:21,360
And the choices
that I want to give to the end user are,

1596
02:13:21,960 --> 02:13:23,360
I don't know

1597
02:13:26,920 --> 02:13:27,400
what kind of.

1598
02:13:27,400 --> 02:13:29,280
Werner if you guys have

1599
02:13:29,960 --> 02:13:33,320
a pattern of selecting a period on the

1600
02:13:34,560 --> 02:13:37,440
empty first option,

1601
02:13:37,440 --> 02:13:41,640
then filter down those and second option

1602
02:13:46,520 --> 02:13:48,840
regression. Now

1603
02:13:51,600 --> 02:13:55,200
how we can send these reports
that matter that I will not tell you

1604
02:13:55,560 --> 02:14:00,440
otherwise you guys will get blocked again
from Google.

1605
02:14:00,440 --> 02:14:04,200
Just specify the email
in the email notification tab

1606
02:14:04,200 --> 02:14:10,200
and the email
will be sent back to my copy.

1607
02:14:10,200 --> 02:14:15,720
So I have added the parameters and
the name of the parameter is a random Yes.

1608
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:17,880
I don't trust you guys.

1609
02:14:17,880 --> 02:14:21,840
It took me more than two weeks
to reinstall set up.

1610
02:14:21,880 --> 02:14:24,480
Best to configure everything please.

1611
02:14:24,840 --> 02:14:27,800
I don't want to trust you anymore.

1612
02:14:27,800 --> 02:14:29,560
I don't have two more weeks.

1613
02:14:30,600 --> 02:14:32,920
Okay. It's

1614
02:14:36,800 --> 02:14:42,000
so in

1615
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,840
the Google section

1616
02:14:46,200 --> 02:14:47,200
in here.

1617
02:14:47,200 --> 02:14:50,640
Instead of hard coding this small,
this time

1618
02:14:50,640 --> 02:14:55,400
we will use the dollar sign
and then we will write the name.

1619
02:14:55,400 --> 02:14:58,200
The parameter that we want to connect

1620
02:14:58,600 --> 02:15:01,560
to are the this this in this project.

1621
02:15:01,560 --> 02:15:07,800
So if I click on Apply and Save this time,
so this time

1622
02:15:07,800 --> 02:15:11,800
you guys will see a new option
It says you just need to was saying build

1623
02:15:11,840 --> 02:15:15,560
now now would say now just saying
build it with the parameters

1624
02:15:17,880 --> 02:15:21,400
So anywhere in your script
where where do you want

1625
02:15:21,400 --> 02:15:25,200
to post external information
you can do that.

1626
02:15:25,200 --> 02:15:27,800
And if I click on Build with now,

1627
02:15:27,800 --> 02:15:31,880
I see all the options
that I specified in that box.

1628
02:15:32,160 --> 02:15:34,280
And let's say I want to smoke.

1629
02:15:34,280 --> 02:15:36,520
I select that option. I click on Build

1630
02:15:38,280 --> 02:15:41,640
and now the information will be passed

1631
02:15:41,640 --> 02:15:45,960
externally and we can use that information
anywhere inside our job.

1632
02:15:46,160 --> 02:15:48,480
We want to wait another two weeks
just to learn.

1633
02:15:48,480 --> 02:15:51,520
Jenkins We should, guys.

1634
02:15:51,520 --> 02:15:58,440
Don't press build now.

1635
02:15:58,440 --> 02:16:18,520
So yes.

1636
02:16:18,520 --> 02:16:20,560
Oh, by the way.

1637
02:16:22,680 --> 02:16:24,680
So these are called

1638
02:16:24,720 --> 02:16:27,000
Jenkins with parameters

1639
02:16:33,880 --> 02:16:34,520
as conditions

1640
02:16:34,520 --> 02:16:37,280
still show us how to do everything
automatically

1641
02:16:38,560 --> 02:16:40,000
woke us up.

1642
02:16:40,320 --> 02:16:43,800
I will show you. But

1643
02:16:43,880 --> 02:16:46,080
not right now, maybe.

1644
02:16:46,080 --> 02:16:46,440
Yeah.

1645
02:16:46,520 --> 02:16:50,680
I just want to make sure
that you guys are ready for your jobs.

1646
02:16:51,120 --> 02:16:55,520
And then maybe after you guys are done
with the regiment, prep prep

1647
02:16:55,560 --> 02:16:58,600
and all of the things we can host, I can
I will

1648
02:16:59,960 --> 02:17:02,120
arrange another session

1649
02:17:02,120 --> 02:17:06,320
to discuss the things in detail
for the Jenkins.

1650
02:17:06,320 --> 02:17:06,600
Okay.

1651
02:17:06,600 --> 02:17:11,320
But right now I want you to start
applying on the jobs as soon as possible,

1652
02:17:11,320 --> 02:17:15,800
because right now a lot of it is super,
super hot batch and students

1653
02:17:15,840 --> 02:17:18,800
getting three of our five qualifiers
each student.

1654
02:17:19,040 --> 02:17:20,120
I mean, it's crazy.

1655
02:17:20,120 --> 02:17:22,320
It never happened before.

1656
02:17:22,320 --> 02:17:24,920
Three offers past
five offers is still much.

1657
02:17:25,520 --> 02:17:28,720
We are also surprised so want you guys

1658
02:17:28,720 --> 02:17:32,240
to jump in the market as soon as possible.

1659
02:17:33,480 --> 02:17:35,040
Yeah so we see our output

1660
02:17:35,040 --> 02:17:38,320
and this time we build the project
with Barenaked us.

1661
02:17:39,680 --> 02:17:40,080
Right

1662
02:17:44,680 --> 02:17:47,760
now there is one more thing.

1663
02:17:47,880 --> 02:17:50,120
Do they care about interviews? Yes.

1664
02:17:50,480 --> 02:17:51,360
No bigger.

1665
02:17:51,360 --> 02:17:52,920
But they will be lenient.

1666
02:17:52,920 --> 02:17:55,440
They will be
and they will be relaxing you. Right.

1667
02:17:55,440 --> 02:17:58,920
And the interviews will not be not,
not will not be that hard.

1668
02:17:59,360 --> 02:18:02,400
When there is a shortage of developers
or testers

1669
02:18:02,400 --> 02:18:06,120
in the market,
they they are not that straight.

1670
02:18:06,280 --> 02:18:10,520
It's our this market actually slowing down
because of the law.

1671
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:14,040
No, no. US market is is not slowing down.

1672
02:18:14,040 --> 02:18:15,840
It's opposite for the US.

1673
02:18:15,840 --> 02:18:19,400
Companies are moving from Russia
and Ukraine where they will go.

1674
02:18:19,400 --> 02:18:23,840
They have to keep their business,
they have to keep their running.

1675
02:18:23,880 --> 02:18:26,000
Right. They will look for other markets.

1676
02:18:26,320 --> 02:18:30,000
Yes, it's bad for maybe Russian students
and Ukraine renaissance,

1677
02:18:30,440 --> 02:18:33,240
but all of the students, it's good
right now.

1678
02:18:33,240 --> 02:18:35,880
And actually it's not bad
for Russian students as well,

1679
02:18:35,920 --> 02:18:41,320
because you guys can start you can guys
you guys can start applying on U.S.

1680
02:18:41,320 --> 02:18:42,440
jobs as well.

1681
02:18:42,440 --> 02:18:46,400
And There are 15 companies,
more than actually 15 companies

1682
02:18:46,400 --> 02:18:50,240
which are interested in the talent
from everywhere.

1683
02:18:50,240 --> 02:18:53,400
So I will share those links
for all of those companies.

1684
02:18:53,760 --> 02:18:58,200
And the only thing they do
is they hire investors

1685
02:18:58,200 --> 02:19:00,840
or developers for the companies

1686
02:19:01,320 --> 02:19:03,680
that are working in the United States.

1687
02:19:04,120 --> 02:19:06,840
So you guys can also be working
from anywhere

1688
02:19:06,880 --> 02:19:09,560
and the company
and the salaries will also be good.

1689
02:19:10,320 --> 02:19:14,000
Not that good for the for example,
if the student is living right now

1690
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:17,280
in the United States, not that good,
but they will be compatible.

1691
02:19:18,080 --> 02:19:18,720
Yeah. Yep.

1692
02:19:18,720 --> 02:19:24,480
From Turkey as well.

1693
02:19:24,480 --> 02:19:27,200
So guys on on your actual jobs.

1694
02:19:28,080 --> 02:19:30,200
Yes you guys will be

1695
02:19:30,680 --> 02:19:34,720
might a good thing
only one project on your Jenkins

1696
02:19:34,720 --> 02:19:40,880
but Jenkins also offers
you flexibility that you can gain multiple

1697
02:19:42,080 --> 02:19:43,480
for example

1698
02:19:43,480 --> 02:19:46,320
if the test cases are passed
from on the U.S.

1699
02:19:46,320 --> 02:19:49,440
servers, then maybe you want to trigger

1700
02:19:49,440 --> 02:19:52,880
the test cases on spreading
or on the unity server.

1701
02:19:53,400 --> 02:19:57,000
Once everything looks good on those
servers, maybe then you want to trigger

1702
02:19:57,000 --> 02:20:01,520
the deployment on production server
and the testing on on production server.

1703
02:20:01,840 --> 02:20:05,520
And you guys can also divide your things
in multiple projects.

1704
02:20:05,720 --> 02:20:09,680
Then one, because let's say for example,
if a project is taking five logs,

1705
02:20:10,520 --> 02:20:15,240
so can execute that project in parallel
or you can chain those projects.

1706
02:20:15,320 --> 02:20:18,120
This is,
these are called pipelines in. Jenkins

1707
02:20:18,680 --> 02:20:21,400
So now I will show you how to build
pipelines in.

1708
02:20:21,400 --> 02:20:27,240
Jenkins So once you are on your dashboard,

1709
02:20:27,240 --> 02:20:31,320
if we don't pass the mock interview,
can we still go on the market?

1710
02:20:31,320 --> 02:20:33,360
If we want, you guys can go.

1711
02:20:33,680 --> 02:20:38,560
And the chances for this audience
to pass the mock interviews,

1712
02:20:39,480 --> 02:20:41,560
those who will be posting the interviews,

1713
02:20:41,920 --> 02:20:45,600
there will be higher chances
of those students.

1714
02:20:45,600 --> 02:20:50,160
Actually companies will companies
will realize, okay,

1715
02:20:50,160 --> 02:20:52,800
they are also good students
because of you,

1716
02:20:52,920 --> 02:20:55,960
because you will be making
a lot of mistakes in the interviews

1717
02:20:56,360 --> 02:21:00,600
and they will realize, okay, maybe
if someone is at least doing something

1718
02:21:00,600 --> 02:21:04,120
better than you,
then they should quickly hire that person.

1719
02:21:04,560 --> 02:21:06,840
So You will be beneficial for others.

1720
02:21:06,920 --> 02:21:09,400
Silver, please go in the market right now

1721
02:21:13,480 --> 02:21:16,200
without forcing the mock interview

1722
02:21:16,200 --> 02:21:19,320
so that others can get jobs quickly.

1723
02:21:20,240 --> 02:21:25,320
If definitely, man, if the mock interviews
fail, it means you are not ready.

1724
02:21:25,640 --> 02:21:28,840
If you cannot answer those questions,

1725
02:21:28,840 --> 02:21:30,440
it's worth the point of.

1726
02:21:30,440 --> 02:21:33,600
Going in the actual market

1727
02:21:34,280 --> 02:21:35,320
am going to find out.

1728
02:21:35,320 --> 02:21:35,880
And you

1729
02:21:37,320 --> 02:21:39,160
tired of this

1730
02:21:41,200 --> 02:21:41,560
bias?

1731
02:21:41,560 --> 02:21:45,360
If you find me missing,
maybe in next 2 to 3 weeks,

1732
02:21:45,360 --> 02:21:49,680
please tell police
that they should contact Silver.

1733
02:21:49,680 --> 02:21:55,920
Yes, Index will arrange mock interviews,
so let's create these pipelines.

1734
02:21:56,160 --> 02:21:56,640
Yeah.

1735
02:21:56,920 --> 02:21:57,920
So if I.

1736
02:21:57,920 --> 02:22:01,040
If I am on dashboard
and if I click on this plus button,

1737
02:22:02,160 --> 02:22:05,080
I can give the pipeline here,
I will helper

1738
02:22:07,320 --> 02:22:09,480
Silver, Aisha

1739
02:22:12,680 --> 02:22:13,960
pipeline.

1740
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:17,120
Okay. So

1741
02:22:19,560 --> 02:22:22,280
please
explain pipeline one more one more time.

1742
02:22:22,280 --> 02:22:27,600
So for I have you ever seen how the
cars are built in factories

1743
02:22:51,600 --> 02:22:52,560
you see

1744
02:22:52,920 --> 02:22:58,120
so so tell me this fraud why
why don't they put all of the equipment

1745
02:22:58,120 --> 02:23:02,320
on a single index
and do all of the things on a single? Why?

1746
02:23:02,360 --> 02:23:03,840
They have multiple machines

1747
02:23:03,840 --> 02:23:07,760
in a pipe, in a
in a line that are going individual task.

1748
02:23:07,760 --> 02:23:13,040
Why not put everything on a single machine
and make that machine build

1749
02:23:13,040 --> 02:23:20,760
the God of all you?

1750
02:23:20,760 --> 02:23:23,840
Everyone is doing the part they know,
but they can also put

1751
02:23:23,840 --> 02:23:26,880
all of the things right on a single line.

1752
02:23:27,160 --> 02:23:29,280
Why install so much equipment?

1753
02:23:29,400 --> 02:23:35,600
Why not program
a single robot to do all of the things?

1754
02:23:35,600 --> 02:23:37,960
Make it faster? Yep.

1755
02:23:38,480 --> 02:23:40,880
So guys, what happens

1756
02:23:41,520 --> 02:23:43,080
if I do that?

1757
02:23:43,080 --> 02:23:45,280
It will slow down the process. What?

1758
02:23:45,720 --> 02:23:49,360
Once a car is built from start to end,

1759
02:23:50,160 --> 02:23:52,920
no new car will enter that assembly line.

1760
02:23:53,520 --> 02:23:56,920
If I make a single machine,
do all of the things.

1761
02:23:57,360 --> 02:23:58,960
It will be complicated.

1762
02:23:58,960 --> 02:24:01,000
First, it will be complicated.

1763
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:02,440
It's not manageable.

1764
02:24:02,440 --> 02:24:03,800
We can not do it.

1765
02:24:03,800 --> 02:24:07,960
In all these scenarios, it's not possible
to put everything on a single dex

1766
02:24:07,960 --> 02:24:12,240
and programable to do all of the things,
sequencing the entire thing.

1767
02:24:12,600 --> 02:24:15,560
Unless and until one complete
car is finished,

1768
02:24:15,920 --> 02:24:18,960
I can not start manufacturing
the next car.

1769
02:24:19,120 --> 02:24:23,880
If I set up multiple pipelines,
I can build things in parallel.

1770
02:24:23,880 --> 02:24:26,640
Right. So that's why we create pipelines.

1771
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:30,200
That's why we don't put everything
in a single project

1772
02:24:30,600 --> 02:24:33,000
so that it's more manageable.

1773
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,120
It's to repair it.

1774
02:24:35,120 --> 02:24:37,080
It's like creating modules.

1775
02:24:37,080 --> 02:24:39,080
One module is doing your things.

1776
02:24:39,080 --> 02:24:44,200
If that module is not working,
we can either modules can still continue.

1777
02:24:44,200 --> 02:24:44,680
Yeah.

1778
02:24:44,920 --> 02:24:48,400
So there's the same,
the same logic happens with the pipelines.

1779
02:24:48,560 --> 02:24:50,440
Yeah. So for example,

1780
02:24:52,200 --> 02:24:52,520
once I

1781
02:24:52,520 --> 02:24:56,480
created
this pipeline, I can say maybe build

1782
02:24:56,520 --> 02:25:00,840
pipeline and I can create it.

1783
02:25:00,840 --> 02:25:06,840
So I am saying,
let's say maybe start this pipeline.

1784
02:25:06,840 --> 02:25:10,760
The first project should be
let's say this, you'll get a project.

1785
02:25:12,240 --> 02:25:12,880
Okay, Yeah.

1786
02:25:14,120 --> 02:25:19,400
And I can say number of beers, maybe two.

1787
02:25:19,400 --> 02:25:20,720
Okay, maybe one will be good.

1788
02:25:20,720 --> 02:25:24,480
So this number of two,
I will tell you once I see their name.

1789
02:25:24,480 --> 02:25:29,400
So refresh frequency one,
which means we should be okay.

1790
02:25:29,480 --> 02:25:33,440
Let let me first build it and then I will
show you are these two options.

1791
02:25:34,080 --> 02:25:35,680
But jokes aside, we will fail.

1792
02:25:35,680 --> 02:25:37,760
Are fossil three real interviews, right?

1793
02:25:37,760 --> 02:25:39,080
No, no, no.

1794
02:25:39,360 --> 02:25:42,800
You guys will not fail
to go to the interviews.

1795
02:25:42,800 --> 02:25:46,040
You guys will fail
at least 10 to 15 interviews.

1796
02:25:47,200 --> 02:25:49,200
Are we following you?

1797
02:25:49,200 --> 02:25:59,760
Yes. You guys can follow me if you want.

1798
02:25:59,760 --> 02:26:01,840
So if been good.

1799
02:26:03,480 --> 02:26:05,880
So this is the name of my pipeline.

1800
02:26:05,880 --> 02:26:09,280
Don't touch anything.

1801
02:26:09,280 --> 02:26:13,800
Just make sure that you guys please don't
make your guitar as your first product.

1802
02:26:13,920 --> 02:26:17,760
Otherwise all of your beers
will be triggered if I trigger this.

1803
02:26:17,760 --> 02:26:21,160
Your guitar, please do something else.

1804
02:26:21,160 --> 02:26:23,160
You skip my question now.

1805
02:26:23,160 --> 02:26:28,680
Can you please reposted?

1806
02:26:28,680 --> 02:26:29,400
Don't worry.

1807
02:26:29,400 --> 02:26:32,320
You will have at least five interviews
in a yes.

1808
02:26:32,320 --> 02:26:33,160
Four are.

1809
02:26:33,480 --> 02:26:37,360
Yep. You are right.

1810
02:26:37,360 --> 02:26:40,400
Previous bachelors
they are now making making excel

1811
02:26:40,400 --> 02:26:43,520
sheets then are they are special.

1812
02:26:43,840 --> 02:26:46,680
They don't even remember
on which company have applied

1813
02:26:46,920 --> 02:26:49,760
and in which state they are right now are
they are dealing

1814
02:26:49,760 --> 02:26:52,760
with each are interviews are technical
so they make associates.

1815
02:26:52,760 --> 02:26:55,520
Okay I am on in on second

1816
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,640
with this company,
third round on this company.

1817
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,560
This is the name of the person
who contacted me.

1818
02:27:01,600 --> 02:27:03,520
This is the name
of the company and all that,

1819
02:27:04,480 --> 02:27:05,640
both creating a

1820
02:27:05,640 --> 02:27:08,400
project and company investors.

1821
02:27:08,400 --> 02:27:12,480
You guys will be creating the pipelines?

1822
02:27:12,480 --> 02:27:15,280
Yes, You guys
will be creating the pipelines there.

1823
02:27:15,280 --> 02:27:16,200
So you want to divide.

1824
02:27:16,200 --> 02:27:18,000
Your best guess is

1825
02:27:18,160 --> 02:27:20,800
you will be deciding which

1826
02:27:20,800 --> 02:27:22,760
pipelines public

1827
02:27:25,680 --> 02:27:27,600
list and the best tool
to market with this.

1828
02:27:27,600 --> 02:27:31,040
So can we get BP and get the job quickly?

1829
02:27:31,040 --> 02:27:41,080
Okay.

1830
02:27:41,080 --> 02:27:43,240
So if you can apply and then you

1831
02:27:46,320 --> 02:27:49,160
so right now
there is only one project in my pipeline.

1832
02:27:49,320 --> 02:27:53,880
Yeah, but if I go back and if I say

1833
02:28:00,880 --> 02:28:01,560
if I,

1834
02:28:01,560 --> 02:28:09,000
if I select that project, then I will say
and what does that mean?

1835
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,520
So if I consider

1836
02:28:14,880 --> 02:28:16,800
have you guys gone, gone

1837
02:28:16,800 --> 02:28:18,960
through the slides of Jenkins

1838
02:28:24,440 --> 02:28:29,520
or and G, Okay,
I will share the slides as well.

1839
02:28:31,280 --> 02:28:33,240
So if we go

1840
02:28:33,240 --> 02:28:35,280
and pause to build actions,

1841
02:28:36,920 --> 02:28:39,720
you guys will see
there is this option, build

1842
02:28:39,720 --> 02:28:42,960
other projects.

1843
02:28:42,960 --> 02:28:46,080
And if I specify in my project in here

1844
02:28:46,800 --> 02:28:50,160
what was the name of my project, XYZ

1845
02:29:09,480 --> 02:29:13,280
and we can.

1846
02:29:13,280 --> 02:29:17,160
Yes, you guys need more practice
or trigger only if the bill is stable,

1847
02:29:17,160 --> 02:29:22,880
which means the first project
is the project from your meetup.

1848
02:29:22,880 --> 02:29:27,480
Once Jenkins execute that project
and if there are no issues,

1849
02:29:27,960 --> 02:29:33,360
then only start executing this second.

1850
02:29:33,360 --> 02:29:36,200
And I if I click on Apply and Save,

1851
02:29:36,200 --> 02:29:39,000
and if I refresh this page,

1852
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:39,920
you guys will see.

1853
02:29:39,920 --> 02:29:42,360
Now I have two projects in Pipeline

1854
02:29:43,200 --> 02:29:46,360
and if I want to add more project
to this pipeline

1855
02:29:46,360 --> 02:29:49,200
now, I can go to my project

1856
02:29:50,320 --> 02:29:53,520
and I can link projects to this pipeline.

1857
02:29:53,800 --> 02:29:59,280
For example, configure

1858
02:29:59,280 --> 02:30:02,320
and then build other projects.

1859
02:30:03,280 --> 02:30:07,920
And then you guys tell
me the name of your simple Java project,

1860
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:16,120
which is working fine, but

1861
02:30:22,920 --> 02:30:47,400
yes, for hard,

1862
02:30:47,400 --> 02:30:50,560
I click on Apply and Save

1863
02:30:50,640 --> 02:30:53,400
and if I refresh yet again.

1864
02:30:53,400 --> 02:30:55,840
So now I have three projects in Pipeline.

1865
02:30:56,120 --> 02:31:00,280
And the beauty of this pipeline is
I only need to trigger this project.

1866
02:31:01,200 --> 02:31:06,040
Okay, So if I click on this first,
this project will be executed.

1867
02:31:06,160 --> 02:31:09,320
Once it passes
the it will trigger the next project.

1868
02:31:09,320 --> 02:31:11,680
When that passes,
it will trigger the next project.

1869
02:31:12,240 --> 02:31:15,120
And I can also add

1870
02:31:16,280 --> 02:31:28,760
a things in parallel.

1871
02:31:28,760 --> 02:31:31,680
So for example, if I go

1872
02:31:31,680 --> 02:31:32,880
as good

1873
02:31:38,280 --> 02:31:43,240
to the project of next pipe
in the same next block.

1874
02:31:43,440 --> 02:31:46,160
Yes weekend, yes we can.

1875
02:31:46,360 --> 02:31:50,920
Yes we can.

1876
02:31:50,920 --> 02:31:54,960
So for example,
if I put comma and let's say

1877
02:31:56,240 --> 02:31:57,360
I, if I use the

1878
02:31:57,360 --> 02:32:02,120
project from Emmett,

1879
02:32:02,120 --> 02:32:05,160
I click on Save and apply

1880
02:32:05,160 --> 02:32:07,280
and if now I refresh it again.

1881
02:32:07,960 --> 02:32:12,000
So you see, after
this second project is executed,

1882
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,640
it will trigger all projects in parallel.

1883
02:32:15,800 --> 02:32:17,640
Okay, offer this

1884
02:32:17,640 --> 02:32:20,640
and you guys can create any branch
in here.

1885
02:32:21,120 --> 02:32:21,640
Yeah.

1886
02:32:22,200 --> 02:32:24,960
Things will be executed
in parallel in sequence,

1887
02:32:24,960 --> 02:32:28,440
whichever configuration
you guys want to have in your projects.

1888
02:32:29,080 --> 02:32:32,040
And what,
what will happen once I click on this one?

1889
02:32:32,240 --> 02:32:34,400
All all of this will be triggered.

1890
02:32:34,960 --> 02:32:39,200
Yes, the parallel is faster yep.

1891
02:32:39,200 --> 02:32:42,520
So if I now click on Run.

1892
02:32:42,520 --> 02:32:44,840
So right now
this project is being executed.

1893
02:32:44,880 --> 02:32:48,160
Okay, we see the output. Yes,
it means job.

1894
02:32:48,360 --> 02:32:53,040
It means job.

1895
02:32:53,040 --> 02:32:56,080
So it has triggered the next project.

1896
02:32:57,120 --> 02:33:01,360
If I click on this slash right now,
this project is being executed

1897
02:33:03,120 --> 02:33:04,800
and this job.

1898
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:08,560
Yes, in parallel, in sequence,
in any configuration

1899
02:33:08,560 --> 02:33:12,440
that you guys want.

1900
02:33:12,440 --> 02:33:15,720
Is there a relation between what you said
there, done or not?

1901
02:33:15,800 --> 02:33:17,960
So you name that.
It is totally different thing.

1902
02:33:18,200 --> 02:33:23,680
It is something that Selenium provides you
if you want to execute your tests.

1903
02:33:23,720 --> 02:33:29,760
This is on with multiple projects
like for example in Firefox, Google Chrome

1904
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:34,200
or you want to split if they feature
their selenium provides in.

1905
02:33:34,200 --> 02:33:39,000
Here is something that a Jenkins provide.

1906
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,400
So do you guys understand
the purpose of pipeline

1907
02:33:42,960 --> 02:33:45,880
execution in parallel in sequence,

1908
02:33:46,600 --> 02:33:49,320
multiple configurations

1909
02:33:49,320 --> 02:33:52,000
that will help us select, say maybe,

1910
02:33:52,760 --> 02:33:54,600
maybe let's say

1911
02:33:55,200 --> 02:33:57,000
B this, this,

1912
02:33:57,000 --> 02:34:00,240
this thing contains
the important test cases.

1913
02:34:00,320 --> 02:34:05,440
Once this justice is passed,
maybe you want to test for two branches.

1914
02:34:06,160 --> 02:34:08,640
Yeah, one will deploy decode.

1915
02:34:08,720 --> 02:34:12,240
Once all the test cases are passed,
one will deploy the code on a server,

1916
02:34:12,240 --> 02:34:15,360
the other will deploy the code
on staging server so you can

1917
02:34:16,040 --> 02:34:18,840
and do things in parallel
on multiple servers.

1918
02:34:19,400 --> 02:34:22,480
Yeah.

1919
02:34:22,480 --> 02:34:25,760
So this is how we can build pipelines
with Jenkins.

1920
02:34:26,640 --> 02:34:31,080
Now let me check
if we are missing something.

1921
02:34:31,080 --> 02:34:59,520
So there are slides of Jenkins
that I would share with you.

1922
02:34:59,520 --> 02:35:04,920
So I have tried to put all the scenarios,
all the advantages, and this advantages

1923
02:35:05,400 --> 02:35:09,280
and everything inside the slides
with pictures and screenshots

1924
02:35:09,880 --> 02:35:20,560
with all the steps that I followed.

1925
02:35:20,560 --> 02:35:23,240
These are actually the same things
that I even just showed you

1926
02:35:37,320 --> 02:35:40,160
about the ground of

1927
02:35:41,200 --> 02:35:42,240
That's it.

1928
02:35:42,480 --> 02:35:44,480
So pretty much everything is cleared now.

1929
02:35:44,760 --> 02:35:48,360
And now you guys
should be good with Jenkins.

1930
02:35:49,120 --> 02:35:53,560
So the things which are related to theory
and your interview questions,

1931
02:35:53,560 --> 02:35:57,720
they are presented in slides and the steps
are also pleather and sliders.

1932
02:35:58,400 --> 02:36:01,680
And if let's say something still confuses

1933
02:36:01,680 --> 02:36:05,400
you, you guys can contact me.

1934
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:07,560
Actually, I was busy with Batch.

1935
02:36:07,560 --> 02:36:10,080
Well,
that's why I could not make you a Jenkins.

1936
02:36:10,080 --> 02:36:11,280
Otherwise I am.

1937
02:36:11,280 --> 02:36:15,200
I was teaching Jenkins
for the last four batches 3 to 4 batches.

1938
02:36:16,080 --> 02:36:17,560
So that's all that happened.

1939
02:36:17,560 --> 02:36:21,720
And accidentally
I don't know the ago shared the admin

1940
02:36:21,760 --> 02:36:24,920
potentials with you and you guys.

1941
02:36:25,160 --> 02:36:25,840
Oh, my God.

1942
02:36:25,840 --> 02:36:27,360
Having destroyed everything,

1943
02:36:27,360 --> 02:36:30,000
there are some other important things
that I want to show you.

1944
02:36:31,240 --> 02:36:34,480
You guys will not be able to see them

1945
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:35,920
because you are.

1946
02:36:35,920 --> 02:36:40,360
You do not have the admin
username password, but now you guys

1947
02:36:40,640 --> 02:36:44,040
might need them on your jobs
if you are hired for a

1948
02:36:45,280 --> 02:36:47,840
better position,

1949
02:36:47,840 --> 02:36:49,960
let's say a technical

1950
02:36:49,960 --> 02:36:54,240
test lead
or a senior test or something like that.

1951
02:36:54,240 --> 02:36:57,720
Yes, I have done this intentionally
not because

1952
02:36:57,720 --> 02:37:01,080
I want you
to start applying on the jobs right now.

1953
02:37:01,480 --> 02:37:05,800
And we can we can do another session
on Jenkins later on, maybe.

1954
02:37:06,120 --> 02:37:12,160
Yeah, but if you guys watch the recording
and if you go to the slides, I hope

1955
02:37:12,400 --> 02:37:16,200
now you guys are good enough
that everything will make

1956
02:37:17,400 --> 02:37:21,880
everything you make sense.

1957
02:37:21,880 --> 02:37:24,560
Has even. Yes, you guys will be able
to find your colleague. It'll

1958
02:37:26,560 --> 02:37:28,680
slides I will share on canvas. Yep.

1959
02:37:29,360 --> 02:37:31,560
Actually I can do that

1960
02:37:38,840 --> 02:37:41,040
now. I want you, every one of you,

1961
02:37:41,040 --> 02:37:43,680
to practice with them and projects

1962
02:37:46,320 --> 02:37:49,800
and create pipelines

1963
02:37:49,800 --> 02:37:51,360
as anyone created by Bernard.

1964
02:37:51,360 --> 02:37:52,520
Do we have access? Yes.

1965
02:37:52,520 --> 02:37:54,760
Do you guys have new guys?
See the option? Yes.

1966
02:37:54,760 --> 02:37:56,240
You guys should see the option.

1967
02:37:56,240 --> 02:37:58,720
And you guys please confirm quickly.

1968
02:37:58,720 --> 02:38:00,840
If you guys see the option

1969
02:38:03,920 --> 02:38:04,760
for creating

1970
02:38:04,760 --> 02:38:11,080
pipelines. Yes.

1971
02:38:11,240 --> 02:38:24,960
You guys should have.

1972
02:38:24,960 --> 02:38:30,600
Your slides are now also available.

1973
02:38:30,600 --> 02:38:35,280
So these are some of the settings all
although almost all the companies,

1974
02:38:35,280 --> 02:38:38,960
they hired a separate team members,
separate teams

1975
02:38:39,960 --> 02:38:43,200
install and set up
all of these things for you.

1976
02:38:43,200 --> 02:38:45,080
It's not your job,

1977
02:38:45,080 --> 02:38:48,600
but it's good to have this
knowledge as well so that you can guide.

1978
02:38:48,640 --> 02:38:49,920
Maybe your team.

1979
02:38:49,920 --> 02:38:53,840
Later on months you guys will be promoted,
you will be dealing with a lot

1980
02:38:53,840 --> 02:38:54,360
of things.

1981
02:38:55,920 --> 02:38:57,720
Please share the notes that you wrote.

1982
02:38:57,720 --> 02:39:04,080
Thank you.

1983
02:39:04,080 --> 02:39:09,840
So I have pushed that or on this
this project to get proper discipline

1984
02:39:10,360 --> 02:39:17,440
for notes and sample.

1985
02:39:17,440 --> 02:39:19,840
So the most important thing is this manage

1986
02:39:19,840 --> 02:39:23,960
plugins as we have plug ins for the clips
and embedded gear

1987
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:27,760
that adds new features
to our core software.

1988
02:39:28,160 --> 02:39:30,200
We also have this option in Jenkins.

1989
02:39:30,200 --> 02:39:33,400
We can install plug ins
that gives us more functionality.

1990
02:39:33,400 --> 02:39:37,000
For example, these are these reports
that you guys have seen.

1991
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:40,760
It's because of this Cucumber report
plugin

1992
02:39:40,760 --> 02:39:43,760
that I installed in Jenkins

1993
02:39:44,080 --> 02:39:49,680
and I even saw so many other plugins.

1994
02:39:49,680 --> 02:39:50,160
Sure.

1995
02:39:51,960 --> 02:39:53,440
So all of these plug ins,

1996
02:39:53,440 --> 02:39:56,680
they are installed
to make this Jenkins work.

1997
02:39:57,440 --> 02:39:59,880
So if you guys want to install
the plug ins.

1998
02:40:00,200 --> 02:40:03,520
You guys can also do it.

1999
02:40:03,520 --> 02:40:05,200
Just click on in here.

2000
02:40:06,320 --> 02:40:07,880
Let's say maybe, I don't

2001
02:40:07,880 --> 02:40:10,440
know, pipeline for pipelines,
we have multiple

2002
02:40:12,960 --> 02:40:15,000
So for example is looking for this

2003
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,400
this pipeline is also

2004
02:40:17,880 --> 02:40:21,280
this pipeline feature
is also because of this really

2005
02:40:21,280 --> 02:40:24,840
the pipeline is not available
in the port of Jenkins.

2006
02:40:25,560 --> 02:40:28,640
These reports will give them the reports

2007
02:40:28,640 --> 02:40:31,760
that are being generated
are also with the help of a plug.

2008
02:40:31,760 --> 02:40:33,080
The GitHub

2009
02:40:33,680 --> 02:40:36,080
is also possible with the help of plug in

2010
02:40:36,960 --> 02:40:40,200
and this maven is also installed
with the help of plug in.

2011
02:40:41,160 --> 02:40:43,200
So Jenkins. Do not provide these.

2012
02:40:43,200 --> 02:40:46,200
It's all because of these plug ins.

2013
02:40:46,440 --> 02:40:46,960
Yeah.

2014
02:40:47,520 --> 02:40:50,480
And you guys can also install it
as we have

2015
02:40:52,040 --> 02:40:56,440
a repository like for example
Maven Central for hosting dogs.

2016
02:40:56,440 --> 02:41:02,920
We have a repository for Jenkins as well
a special repository in which

2017
02:41:04,360 --> 02:41:07,160
you guys will find a lot of

2018
02:41:07,160 --> 02:41:10,640
plug ins related to all of those things

2019
02:41:11,520 --> 02:41:14,200
security email credential,
a lot of plug ins,

2020
02:41:14,200 --> 02:41:19,200
a lot of plug ins.

2021
02:41:19,200 --> 02:41:24,360
So you guys can introduce
so many things in your Jenkins

2022
02:41:24,360 --> 02:41:26,520
You can customize in many, many different

2023
02:41:28,440 --> 02:41:30,480
and this is how you make it work.

2024
02:41:30,480 --> 02:41:34,160
This configure system is very,
very technical

2025
02:41:35,920 --> 02:41:40,080
and there are very, very few chances
that you guys will deal with.

2026
02:41:40,080 --> 02:41:43,200
This number of executable
simply means how many projects

2027
02:41:43,240 --> 02:41:46,560
you can run in parallel
if your hardware supports it.

2028
02:41:46,560 --> 02:41:47,320
Why, period?

2029
02:41:47,320 --> 02:41:48,560
How much time?

2030
02:41:48,560 --> 02:41:53,880
Jenkins should do nothing
before starting the next job.

2031
02:41:53,880 --> 02:41:59,280
This is the you are told that is appearing
in here, the domain that we registered?

2032
02:41:59,640 --> 02:42:04,520
Yes. It is something very, very advanced.

2033
02:42:04,920 --> 02:42:09,360
You cannot predict who you will
manage of this.

2034
02:42:09,360 --> 02:42:10,960
This you guys might need it

2035
02:42:11,960 --> 02:42:12,960
the manage plugins,

2036
02:42:12,960 --> 02:42:15,720
but other of these things they are
they are not your job

2037
02:42:16,720 --> 02:42:22,520
and you guys, if your task
if you are executing slowly

2038
02:42:22,520 --> 02:42:31,560
you guys can check the system information
and the load statistics in here.

2039
02:42:31,560 --> 02:42:36,240
So this is the big where we started
executing all of the things,

2040
02:42:36,240 --> 02:42:45,840
the graph that you guys see,
these are the system resources.

2041
02:42:45,840 --> 02:42:48,360
So this is the machine
that is being installed in here,

2042
02:42:48,600 --> 02:42:51,400
the Java Environment API, Java

2043
02:42:51,400 --> 02:42:57,560
specification.

2044
02:42:57,560 --> 02:42:59,160
This is a Linux system.

2045
02:42:59,160 --> 02:43:06,080
It has the architecture of AMD for 64.

2046
02:43:06,080 --> 02:43:10,080
These are the environment variables
that we selected, all the plug ins

2047
02:43:10,440 --> 02:43:12,600
that are installed,

2048
02:43:13,200 --> 02:43:18,960
all that information.

2049
02:43:18,960 --> 02:43:22,920
Now if you guys want to dig deeper,
I it's possible

2050
02:43:22,920 --> 02:43:26,600
to install Jenkins on your local computer,
your laptops as well.

2051
02:43:27,360 --> 02:43:31,520
If you guys are interested,
I will suggest you to install it

2052
02:43:32,040 --> 02:43:36,720
on your local computers
to learn all about Jenkins

2053
02:43:37,880 --> 02:43:38,320
wiring.

2054
02:43:38,320 --> 02:43:42,280
Coding is something you don't need, but

2055
02:43:48,720 --> 02:43:50,560
there are multiple formats in

2056
02:43:50,560 --> 02:43:52,560
which all of the files are encoded

2057
02:43:53,640 --> 02:43:56,280
for you would be a duty of 17.

2058
02:43:56,280 --> 02:44:02,760
So you guys remember everything is
converted to bits, ones and zeros, right?

2059
02:44:03,160 --> 02:44:08,760
So there must a mechanism
who tells us that if let's say

2060
02:44:08,760 --> 02:44:13,960
and then ones are stored in
computer memory, what does that mean.

2061
02:44:13,960 --> 02:44:14,640
Right.

2062
02:44:14,640 --> 02:44:18,840
If there is a combination of five
0 to 5 ones, what does that mean?

2063
02:44:19,480 --> 02:44:23,680
All of this information
is coming from that encoding.

2064
02:44:23,680 --> 02:44:26,280
All of these rules
are written in that encoding.

2065
02:44:26,280 --> 02:44:29,520
So what does those ones and zeros means?

2066
02:44:29,800 --> 02:44:31,440
It is it is written in encoding.

2067
02:44:31,440 --> 02:44:34,760
Your computer reads that information
from that, encoding

2068
02:44:35,880 --> 02:44:39,240
that you provide
and then converts back to your ones

2069
02:44:39,240 --> 02:44:43,040
and zeros to characters
like ABC or Special

2070
02:44:43,520 --> 02:44:46,920
that you see on your keyboard
and it draws all those things on you.

2071
02:44:48,160 --> 02:44:49,480
There is right now there is

2072
02:44:49,480 --> 02:44:54,880
UTF 16 that sports, sports
all the human languages that we use,

2073
02:44:55,200 --> 02:44:58,240
it has all the alphabets for Chinese,
Arabic and English.

2074
02:44:58,320 --> 02:44:59,760
UTF eight is simple one.

2075
02:44:59,760 --> 02:45:01,640
It has less, not less options.

2076
02:45:01,640 --> 02:45:04,560
UTF 16 contains the information

2077
02:45:05,440 --> 02:45:09,160
that what does those ones and zeros
means on your computer

2078
02:45:09,160 --> 02:45:13,840
and your computer takes help from that
encoding to convert back of the data

2079
02:45:14,080 --> 02:45:17,480
to correct the emoji,
the special symbols and all that.

2080
02:45:18,040 --> 02:45:20,240
This is how important words are.

2081
02:45:20,320 --> 02:45:22,080
So give me access to jobs code.

2082
02:45:22,080 --> 02:45:24,720
But it does not work in my P.C..

2083
02:45:24,720 --> 02:45:28,840
Are there any any other questions, guys?

2084
02:45:28,840 --> 02:45:32,520
How to find out who delivered something
like your project, for example?

2085
02:45:32,800 --> 02:45:35,400
You guys don't need to do it. You have to

2086
02:45:36,400 --> 02:45:39,600
do you have to check the logs.

2087
02:45:39,600 --> 02:45:41,680
Also the when you were born

2088
02:45:46,880 --> 02:45:52,760
guys, you guys going to follow this video?

2089
02:45:52,760 --> 02:45:57,360
If you want to explore Jenkins more,
you can install it on your computer

2090
02:45:57,840 --> 02:45:58,840
and play with it.

2091
02:45:58,840 --> 02:46:00,480
But it is not required.

2092
02:46:00,480 --> 02:46:03,240
It is not required at Max from testers.

2093
02:46:03,240 --> 02:46:04,320
This is what they expect.

2094
02:46:04,320 --> 02:46:06,880
You should know how to create a job.

2095
02:46:06,880 --> 02:46:12,440
You should know how to create
a pipeline project and how to pull ACM.

2096
02:46:12,440 --> 02:46:18,000
And no, not that much.

2097
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:22,280
Are there other questions guys?

2098
02:46:22,280 --> 02:46:23,920
How many years are you learning?

2099
02:46:23,920 --> 02:46:27,240
I started learning in 2013.

2100
02:46:27,600 --> 02:46:30,080
It's seven, eight,

2101
02:46:30,360 --> 02:46:33,920
nine nine.

2102
02:46:33,920 --> 02:46:34,760
When is dividing?

2103
02:46:34,760 --> 02:46:36,800
In September on 22 September.

2104
02:46:37,720 --> 02:46:40,400
And give me our regular moment project
that we created.

2105
02:46:40,400 --> 02:46:42,320
Is it only me? Yes.

2106
02:46:42,320 --> 02:46:42,680
I see.

2107
02:46:42,680 --> 02:46:54,040
It is only you you.

2108
02:46:54,040 --> 02:46:56,880
You guys will be rich not only next week,

2109
02:46:57,600 --> 02:47:00,200
but in the not in the next month.

2110
02:47:00,200 --> 02:47:04,240
But in the you guys will start
getting rich in May or June

2111
02:47:06,360 --> 02:47:08,800
will use
all my issue with my cucumber for hot.

2112
02:47:08,840 --> 02:47:13,480
Tell me the name of the project.

2113
02:47:13,480 --> 02:47:13,760
Yeah.

2114
02:47:13,920 --> 02:47:27,440
Shallow.

2115
02:47:27,440 --> 02:47:30,600
Well, you mean your intelligence

2116
02:47:31,920 --> 02:47:33,760
or you still remember it?

2117
02:47:33,760 --> 02:47:36,160
I use this spring so that students forget.

2118
02:47:36,160 --> 02:47:40,800
So I tell them, You guys remind me at the
end of the class and everyone is super.

2119
02:47:40,800 --> 02:47:44,040
They just go to sleep,
they forget and they never bother me.

2120
02:47:44,280 --> 02:47:48,360
But you still remember, man.

2121
02:47:48,360 --> 02:47:54,040
Yeah.

2122
02:47:54,040 --> 02:47:59,520
Danny Jack, Maven, Austin Project.

2123
02:47:59,520 --> 02:48:03,000
And it works right then, but I don't know,

2124
02:48:03,120 --> 02:48:06,320
maybe Farhad now know

2125
02:48:06,320 --> 02:48:13,240
that after restricting us,
you see who we know?

2126
02:48:13,240 --> 02:48:14,880
Your tricks? Not guys.

2127
02:48:14,880 --> 02:48:26,520
Please don't tell.

2128
02:48:26,520 --> 02:48:34,600
Actually,
all the teachers are doing it in here.

2129
02:48:34,600 --> 02:48:35,080
Method.

2130
02:48:35,080 --> 02:48:37,000
Learn them. Tell

2131
02:49:21,520 --> 02:49:23,080
you. Yeah, I will.

2132
02:49:23,080 --> 02:49:25,000
I will show you later. Means never

2133
02:49:29,280 --> 02:49:32,160
one syntax Syntax
and I will come back to the question.

2134
02:49:32,160 --> 02:49:34,520
And the session ended
and they never answered.

2135
02:49:35,280 --> 02:49:39,240
Sometimes the answer right away though

2136
02:49:40,720 --> 02:49:44,040
it depends on the question
if that is useless question

2137
02:49:44,560 --> 02:49:47,280
and you should know the answer.

2138
02:49:47,920 --> 02:49:49,960
That's one instructor usually

2139
02:49:51,280 --> 02:49:54,040
responds like this.

2140
02:49:54,040 --> 02:49:56,520
It happened with me too

2141
02:49:57,080 --> 02:50:00,920
along the out of next week.

2142
02:50:00,920 --> 02:50:02,480
It's not about complication.

2143
02:50:02,480 --> 02:50:03,400
I don't think so.

2144
02:50:03,400 --> 02:50:08,200
In syntax there is someone who do not have
the proper knowledge to teach.

2145
02:50:08,200 --> 02:50:10,760
It's not about knowledge, I guess.

2146
02:50:10,760 --> 02:50:12,480
At least it's not the case with me.

2147
02:50:12,480 --> 02:50:15,000
I don't think I have. You guys have.

2148
02:50:15,040 --> 02:50:16,600
Have you guys ever?

2149
02:50:16,600 --> 02:50:19,040
Have I ever not answered your question?

2150
02:50:19,040 --> 02:50:22,240
Have you ever seen me
that I said, let's say

2151
02:50:22,240 --> 02:50:25,320
maybe I don't know the answer
or maybe I will tell you later.

2152
02:50:25,640 --> 02:50:26,680
It's very rare.

2153
02:50:26,680 --> 02:50:29,040
But then the question is super,
super dumb.

2154
02:50:29,800 --> 02:50:35,120
Then you actually start to do this. But

2155
02:50:37,600 --> 02:50:39,120
it's happening right now too.

2156
02:50:39,120 --> 02:50:48,000
You see,

2157
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:51,600
sometimes I think maybe when we are tired,

2158
02:50:52,680 --> 02:50:55,240
then then all all is being recorded.

2159
02:50:55,240 --> 02:50:56,840
Why am I why am recording this?
