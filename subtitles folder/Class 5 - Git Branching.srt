1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,560
Okay, guys.

2
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,640
So let's begin today's lecture

3
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,320
and today's topic is going to be

4
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,400
good practice.

5
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,560
Okay. So

6
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,600
have you ever seen a piece

7
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,720
of this line about just getting though?

8
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,760
There are a lot of crunches right?

9
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,560
And all those boxes

10
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,160
demolished together,

11
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,160
forming the trunk of the tree.

12
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:57,880
Right.

13
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,040
That's how trees are formed.

14
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,080
And so you get

15
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,480
branches are very similar to

16
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,800
those kind of branches with the pre has

17
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,920
the merge in the end
to form a single trunk,

18
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,680
a single high plane, are you going
see a single dry top?

19
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,440
Okay.

20
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,080
So first

21
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,000
let's have one question
that why do we need

22
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,960
branches in the first place?

23
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,400
So who is going to accept that
body, this thing?

24
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,040
Why do we need branches

25
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,560
to avoid most conflict? No.

26
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,440
Even if you create branches,
you are still going to face most conflicts

27
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,920
in order to work separate the

28
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,720
and spread information
so we do not mess up the mean.

29
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,680
Yes. Has some very good

30
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,880
to have leaves obey

31
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,040
the no word on mean is good.

32
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,840
Okay so guys

33
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,240
this scenario is that let's let's tackle

34
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:33,080
this question to a very practical example.

35
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,440
We all use Facebook right?

36
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,080
We are always using Facebook.

37
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,400
So let's assume that the production

38
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,480
code of the Facebook is in the main branch

39
00:02:47,600 --> 00:03:01,200
are the last of us.

40
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,720
So this is basically the code
which is being run on our mobile phones.

41
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,840
This is the actual application code.

42
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:18,040
So let's see now, Nasser is one of the
engineers and Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg

43
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,800
just called us and say, Hey, now,
so can you just update one feature?

44
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,440
This emoji needs to be updated.

45
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,720
Let's just assume that.

46
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,320
So do you guys think that

47
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,040
this particular code in the Mean branch

48
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,240
Nazir is going to work on the same code

49
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,280
to edit that Moji?

50
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,360
What if he does that?

51
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,080
What are the chances?

52
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,800
What are the risks involved?

53
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,200
What will happen

54
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,000
did not do that

55
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:09,720
well, exactly.

56
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,600
He should not be doing that
because there is a possibility that he can

57
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,520
he may make some mistake

58
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,840
and affect the rest of the code also.

59
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,400
And, you know, his book loses
billion dollars

60
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,200
and Nasr is fired immediately.

61
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,600
So he is going to stay away
from this particular

62
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:38,400
branch, make sense.

63
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:38,800
Okay.

64
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,440
So now what he wants to do is he
still wants to work on that feature.

65
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,280
And it's going to be a combination
of the code one over here.

66
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,320
So he's just going to go ahead

67
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,800
and copy this branch

68
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,720
and create his own personal branch.

69
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,440
He can name a

70
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,600
edit in

71
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:08,720
the emoji.

72
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,480
In here.

73
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,400
He will write down the additional code

74
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,480
which is required to

75
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,720
update that particular emoji.

76
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,240
And once he has tested that,

77
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,240
then he can open up a pull request
to merge this plot with the main branch

78
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,760
so that the production crew
can have the updated

79
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,640
why when the project team

80
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,520
wants to do that being starting,
what's separate down the folder?

81
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,520
Well, there were branching,
but when they went down

82
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,760
actually
this was most probably due to the servers.

83
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,960
I believe it was not some kind of update.

84
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,160
It was even if it was updated,
then it must be a hardware

85
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,880
level update because of the level up.

86
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,920
It didn't require your applications

87
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,440
to be done.

88
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:35,040
Okay, so do you guys understand
the need of branches?

89
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,360
Okay,

90
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,280
so we are going to spend some more time
on this because this is important

91
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,080
to understand that.

92
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,080
Why do we need lots in the first place?

93
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,680
So I'm going to give you
some more examples.

94
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:46,920
Okay.

95
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:51,720
So you mean branch or in
lots of rocks is your default branch.

96
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,400
It is

97
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,240
also called Master
and it is also calling me, but now it is.

98
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,080
GitHub is updating everything
and it says that it should be called

99
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,840
main.

100
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,800
So your main branch is supposed
to have your production code

101
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:15,400
or the file code, but

102
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,280
and let's assume

103
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,160
that on this particular means you have

104
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,960
some good some comments.

105
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,080
So this is going to be RC one

106
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,000
that me URL of

107
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,400
these circles are going to represent

108
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,120
our comments, but

109
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,680
let's call it c1c to

110
00:07:50,920 --> 00:08:01,760
C tweet.

111
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:09,000
Okay.

112
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,280
Now let's say that
there is a new feature coming in

113
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,880
and we want to work on that
particular feature.

114
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,520
Let's assume that it's an automation

115
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,960
script for some application

116
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:28,800
and it's in it's in the production
there it is be used in real time.

117
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,720
But there is an other feature

118
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,800
that needs to be tested
and it would have to be written yet.

119
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,120
So what do you guys suppose?

120
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,720
What should happen?

121
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:45,000
Let's say Mike is responsible
for working on that feature.

122
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
What should Mike do now?

123
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,080
Mike should create a new branch, right?

124
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,640
He should create a new branch.

125
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:02,320
So when he's going to create a new boss,
the new branch is going to be created

126
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:17,400
from this one.

127
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:24,560
And he will say, that's a new feature.

128
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,560
Okay, what do we mean
by saying that the branch is going to be

129
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,040
made at this point?

130
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:36,800
It means that all the code which is MCP

131
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,600
is going to be copied in new feature

132
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,120
form belief system. Yes,

133
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,240
it's going to be there in the new field

134
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,320
and then he's going to start
working on updates

135
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,960
and start making new comments.

136
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:04,160
Let's say he's working on a new feature
and the commit is that C?

137
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,840
C for the numbers don't matter

138
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,040
and just for the ID,

139
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:16,440
I mean C five and cc6

140
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,920
and whatever updates he is doing,

141
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,560
they are obviously not affecting

142
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:43,200
the main.

143
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,240
Now let's assume that the
new feature has been tested

144
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:48,800
and it's

145
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,800
working perfectly fine.

146
00:10:52,800 --> 00:11:00,000
I think we let the loop was the team.

147
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,800
Mike is going to

148
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,680
tell you, Hey look, I'm

149
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:13,520
done with the new feature.

150
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,520
Can we review it?

151
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,800
Bloomberg is going to say yes, why not?

152
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,840
So Loop was going to go
into the new feature branch on GitHub.

153
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,640
He's going to review the code that Mike
has written as he's the team B, right?

154
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,320
So he needs to review it.

155
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,320
Once he is satisfied,
then he would say, okay, now

156
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,600
the code is good, everything seems fine.

157
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,440
I think now it's
okay to merge it into the mean

158
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:48,400
so that our production code can also
have this new feature and make use of it.

159
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:53,320
So then he's going to merge it
into the main branch.

160
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,560
How this merging happens.

161
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,760
We will discuss that in detail,
but for now just

162
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:03,960
the concept is important.

163
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,760
Okay, so all of you acted as with me
till this point.

164
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:14,160
Any confusion or question?

165
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:14,840
Okay.

166
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:20,200
Everyone is good, right?

167
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:20,480
Okay.

168
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:26,160
Now I'm going to speak about some
terminologies that you may

169
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,440
listen
when you are working on such a project.

170
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,960
So people,

171
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,480
these terminologies
do vary from country to country.

172
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,760
Okay, So some companies may use different
native terminology

173
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,440
and other one different type, but
I'm going to just give you a hint of that.

174
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,040
So let me open up this.

175
00:12:49,520 --> 00:13:00,040
Okay,

176
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,240
So let's say that
if a new feature is there

177
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,720
and for that purpose,
a new branch has to be made.

178
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:11,800
So this branch can be called
a topic branch because it's a new topic,

179
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:18,120
it's a new feature, but it may vary
depending upon the company.

180
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:23,760
Okay, so just for an insight
that if you ever hear some topic branch,

181
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,040
you should not be like,
okay, what's a topic words?

182
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,680
So if a new feature is being

183
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,000
worked
on, we can call that particular branch.

184
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,520
I talked to French.

185
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:38,440
Okay, so we already know that mean R.M.

186
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,520
is the at true blotch on

187
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,880
in which all we want is

188
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,000
and then we have

189
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,440
one more scenario.

190
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,200
Okay.

191
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,280
Now let's say that

192
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,400
in this topic what when Mike was working
on the new feature

193
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,640
after at this point in the commit six

194
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,960
he faced some issues he found a bump

195
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:21,480
and his own goal.

196
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,080
This call was quite lengthy.

197
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:28,840
Everything was working fine, but there was
still bugs that were still there.

198
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,400
He wants to resolve them,
but he also does not want to mess up

199
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,240
with the code that he has with it.

200
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,920
So what should he do at this point?

201
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:58,280
What can he do?

202
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:03,000
Okay, so I'm going to repeat the question
again and then you'll

203
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,800
come to the solution and wait.

204
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,680
You would be the person.

205
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,360
The question is that
after making the six commit,

206
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,440
this particular commit still has some bugs

207
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,480
that needs to be resolved.

208
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,760
Everything else is working fine,
but there are few bugs

209
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,840
that needs to be resolved.

210
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,400
This code is quite lengthy
so he made the permit

211
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,720
not used the correct to

212
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,920
because that was important.

213
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,600
He did not want to lose this process
and now he wants to resolve that bug also.

214
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,320
But he does not want to mess up
his own branch

215
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,480
with individual comments
because it is to the most to after.

216
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,480
All right,

217
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,320
it is going to be merged to master.

218
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,640
So he does not want to have
unnecessary comments on this box.

219
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,960
He wants to keep it very clean
and the history he wants to

220
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,640
maintain it smoothly. Yes.

221
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,400
So in order to have that,
what he's going to do is

222
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:07,240
he is going to create
a new branch at this point

223
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,600
and he can simply name it resolving.

224
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:23,280
But in there

225
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,480
he can start working on

226
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,840
the solution of this bug

227
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,880
and makes make comments if you want to.

228
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:42,840
And once he has completely resolved
his job, then he can merge

229
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,440
the correct go back to

230
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:54,560
topic branch.

231
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,280
Okay.

232
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:00,800
So did you see that how the creation of
branches is going to save him?

233
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,280
A lot of hassle.

234
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,760
It's going to make his life very easy
in order to save his progress

235
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:11,680
and maintain a complete clean history.

236
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,320
Because remember,

237
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:15,480
I told you guys that it's very important
to maintain a clean history.

238
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:20,160
The irregular commit should not be there
because at the end of the day,

239
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,520
if someone new joins in on the project
are really

240
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,920
it has to be made you might have to go to
some previous commit.

241
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,760
So it's very important to maintain
a good clean history.

242
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,880
That's actually how

243
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,840
that we serve

244
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:38,680
the purpose of using get.

245
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:42,280
Okay now the question I'm asked about
can you go to see five?

246
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,200
No, no, I cannot go to see five,

247
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,040
although we can, but we should not.

248
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,400
Why would we go to a previous commit?

249
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:52,720
Okay.

250
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,840
See 60, correct?

251
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,760
Yes, this is right now
everything that we have,

252
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,760
everything that we are talking about,
it's in the local repository.

253
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:07,280
We are not talking about GitHub of yet.

254
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:07,920
Okay.

255
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:12,240
So if you find that a bug and see it
then will create a new branch, right?

256
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,200
Okay. So this is a very good question.

257
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,560
Another thing
that if he finds a new bug in seed,

258
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,880
he is going to create
should he create a new branch.

259
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,120
So what do you guys think?

260
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:31,800
Should he be grieving
then he brought or not?

261
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,240
Okay, so let's look at this. Let's look at

262
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,400
the rest
of the questions that I have missed.

263
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,440
Like you have read them
because they are not.

264
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:44,040
But for now, let me just

265
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,680
explain. Okay.

266
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,920
So even if you now he finds

267
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,200
a new bug in seed,

268
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,280
he should not be creating a new branch.

269
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,560
Why is that?

270
00:18:54,560 --> 00:19:00,960
So let me explain to you.

271
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,960
Because this particular broad new feature,

272
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,080
this is the only branch
which is going to be merged

273
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,280
to make the right Resolving bug
is not going to be most of master.

274
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,200
Do you guys approved that?

275
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,560
It is going to be merged to puppet much.

276
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:25,800
So what he can do, he does not need
to actually create a new branch over here.

277
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,920
This is all Bloomberg is dedicated

278
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,400
to resolving bugs, although he can.

279
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,680
No one is going to stop him
from creating this branch.

280
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,800
But why do we have so many unnecessary
branches?

281
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,200
Right? This is not required.

282
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,920
You can also
actually resolve the bug at this point

283
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,760
because he thinks
that the bug is quite small

284
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,680
and he will be able to locate it
immediately.

285
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,760
But usually when you are working on
quite lengthy codes and you know

286
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,680
you are not sure whether it's solving
that particular bug

287
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,800
is going to affect the rest of your code.

288
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,960
You need to do some experimentation
like deletion of a class

289
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,960
and you should have a
class are making some changes in your pol

290
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,920
or any any other thing
and you do not want to affect

291
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,080
your rest of code
which is already written.

292
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,120
Then you create a new branch
that's the whole purpose.

293
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,280
So it's not that whenever
you are trying to resolve something,

294
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,480
you just create a new branch.

295
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,320
Rather, it's
more of the sense that you know that

296
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,200
if you will be
making some edits in your code,

297
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,480
your code might be affected

298
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,600
and you do not want it to be affected.

299
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,160
You not want to lose the previous progress
at that point of the merge.

300
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:39,480
Okay.

301
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,200
So now Mohammed is saying
he can make a branch only he murders

302
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,320
bugs to make that

303
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,920
he can make a branch
obviously murders, but

304
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:57,240
to make that for the license
and then we know Mohammed that's not that

305
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,040
even if he has not merged it,
he can still create a branch over here.

306
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,800
We have not merge it yet,
but he can create a much

307
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,880
as long as you are not covered by

308
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:16,680
no need for creating a branch,
as long as you are not copied branch.

309
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,840
No need to click.

310
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,360
No, no, I said that's not the you.

311
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,840
If you want to work on some new feature,
you have to create a new branch.

312
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,480
You are now going to work on Master

313
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,520
Alex.

314
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,760
He can just come in the pool.

315
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,800
We are

316
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,760
what I talk about. Alex

317
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:40,800
Okay.

318
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:50,200
Any of the questions that you guys may
have?

319
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,840
Let's say he created a new topic
and it is all about is he now committed

320
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:07,800
to the main
or he has to commit first in the future?

321
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,960
Okay, so how do I just say that

322
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,800
he created a new type of branch
and then he

323
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,800
he created a new branch to resolve, Right.

324
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,880
And after that,
he is going to commit directly to master

325
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,280
or he is going to commit the topic branch.

326
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,360
He is never going to commit.

327
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,880
Okay, This is not the question.

328
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,840
Then what

329
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,720
if you add another type of mind?

330
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,400
Okay, so let's create
another topic. Right?

331
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,240
So which one do you want to create about
the branch at sea?

332
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:45,920
Three are

333
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,560
sea two Where where

334
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:52,320
do you want to create it?

335
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,960
See seven

336
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,280
You cannot create a thousand branch
at sea.

337
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:01,200
Seven That that is not like that
doesn't make sense.

338
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,000
You are resolving above over here
and while creating a new type of branch

339
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,120
at this point

340
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,000
this is all in about
what do you want to do with this branch?

341
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:37,080
You want to create a new branch at seven?

342
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,080
Yes, you can create, but not required.

343
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,920
Okay, let's let's do this.

344
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,200
It's not required,
but let's assume that he did.

345
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,200
Okay.
So he created a new branch over here.

346
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,600
Okay, then what?

347
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,320
Let's call it Arbi.

348
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,040
He has new
commit are going to be right here.

349
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:59,520
Right.

350
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,120
Okay.

351
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:03,760
So now he needs to commit to this branch

352
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,320
and then this branch is going to be
my topic branch.

353
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:11,680
You should not directly merge this project
over here because at this one

354
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:15,480
these particular commits are going to be
skipped and the history will be missing.

355
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:32,000
So that is going to create a problem.

356
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,040
Okay, Now it's very simple.

357
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:42,600
Don't worry,

358
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,720
you guys just
I'm just explaining the need right now.

359
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:55,440
When you go over the example, it's
going to be very clear to all of you.

360
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,960
Okay, So let me show you this slide.

361
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,480
Okay, guys.

362
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:11,960
So let's have a look at this.

363
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:15,920
So over here, what is happening
is that this particular John,

364
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,160
he has the idea of a new feature,
as we discussed earlier.

365
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,960
So he just created a new feature.

366
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,840
Branch
started working on this. And when this was

367
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,200
completed demoted back to the mean

368
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,600
and that's it simple
what are we have discussed

369
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,400
in the simulation

370
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,440
so remember one thing
whenever you want to work

371
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,360
in a group project,
the rule of thumb is that

372
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:46,240
you will never be working on the massive
branch.

373
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,720
Okay, Is that clear to everyone?

374
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:53,200
Never work on the mean
or the master branch.

375
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,360
Always create your own new branches.

376
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,520
Okay,
Now let me explain to you a little bit

377
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:04,240
that how you will be proceeding at work.

378
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,200
So let's say that this is a master branch

379
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:14,040
that you have at work.

380
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:18,760
This is our master branch
and it contains some comments.

381
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,400
Bananas going to simply

382
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:37,000
want to present this.

383
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:44,280
So anything you
what is it just for one member?

384
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:49,640
No, no, I said that's not a scenario.

385
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,760
I went to this plant.

386
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,640
And when was that?

387
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,160
Just. Just made just for your purposes.

388
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:59,520
Okay, so this is the scenario
that this is the master, right?

389
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,680
That we have of work.

390
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,880
Okay.

391
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,800
And this code is running fine.

392
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,240
It's in front of

393
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,120
the. Now let's take action.

394
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,720
I say as one of the employer, the company,
and he's a brilliant person

395
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,960
who has to work on

396
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:27,120
two different features,

397
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,520
which are one

398
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,400
and future do

399
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,040
so I say have to work on two features.

400
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,120
We can one and two.

401
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:48,120
Now, remember
one thing, guys, it's your choice.

402
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,440
How long number of branches
you want to create.

403
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,520
It's your twice.

404
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,720
No one is going to come to
you and tell you, Hey,

405
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,160
why did you create two branches here?

406
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,760
Why did you create one branch
at the end of year?

407
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:05,560
What they are going to require from you
is at least one branch

408
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:09,840
that has that particular feature added
and a code is working fine.

409
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,360
That's it.

410
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:14,960
No one cares about how your branch of this
structure is for your own sense.

411
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,280
It's for your own ease
that I'm trying to develop this sense.

412
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,320
Okay, so now what should I look?

413
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,200
Is if I were, I showed what I would do.

414
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,680
I would say that,
okay, create a new branch

415
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,840
at this point and name it

416
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,160
future one,

417
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,760
and also create a newborn for this one.

418
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,840
A name a 3 to 2,

419
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,040
and then work on this branch

420
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,840
and parallel

421
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:53,720
on both different features.

422
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,840
Let's say at the time the I'm done

423
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,640
with working in Branch F one,
so my feature one is complete.

424
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,880
I will tell my team that hey,
it's done, can be merged.

425
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,040
He will say, okay, I merged feature.

426
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,640
One will be added

427
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,360
over the time I'm working on project two.

428
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,000
As soon as the future
two is going to be out of the

429
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,120
hey can be merged, you'll say Why not?

430
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,720
It's working out much
so it will merge the master and the master

431
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:26,040
is going to have feature one
and you could do both.

432
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,000
And let's assume that in parallel

433
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,760
what is
going to work will be a mark in parallel.

434
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:41,120
Amanda is also working on feature pre.

435
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:48,520
So what he is going to do,
it is also going to create one branch here

436
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,840
named Feature Tree

437
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,680
and will start

438
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:58,640
working on that particular feature.

439
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,480
And at any point in time

440
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,480
this feature is completed here, merge it

441
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,520
back to the master

442
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,880
after the team need has reviewed.

443
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,600
Obviously those conditions are

444
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:15,800
the same time.

445
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,320
Master. Lucky to work.

446
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:22,680
Yes, Master will be working and
as soon as the feature is called he did.

447
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,640
The code is merge after the check so
the master is not going to be effective.

448
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:32,240
So now is this to everyone?

449
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,640
Pretty simple, right?

450
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,560
Let them come to get it in writing.

451
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:38,640
It's just creating your own branch
and doing stuff over there.

452
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:39,840
And as it

453
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,560
now, it's your first choice.

454
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,520
How many branches do you want to me?

455
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,320
But we very vigilant about it.

456
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:50,560
Okay.

457
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:56,440
Do not unnecessary branches.

458
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:01,120
Mohammad Yes that is going to this
now you for that we have a separate class

459
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:07,440
tomorrow dedicated
to how to resolve those conflicts.

460
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,000
How will need view it
if you cannot committed

461
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,760
permit how much movement
I think you want to say

462
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,040
merge it

463
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,720
you can you get
you are making so much in your right.

464
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:35,720
These are the permits that you are making.

465
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,480
Okay.

466
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,560
So now

467
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,640
the rest of your questions
are going to be answered.

468
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,520
Then you will be doing the actual
examples.

469
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,200
Okay.

470
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,720
But this was just giving you

471
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,760
a brief scenario of the need

472
00:31:53,800 --> 00:32:30,880
and use if this applies.

473
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,240
Okay.

474
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:35,240
So let's
go ahead and do one basic example.

475
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,400
But that what I want is

476
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:43,080
I want you guys to open up to intelligent

477
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,320
because you are going to be moving
very slow.

478
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:54,600
So I really want all of you to be in sync.

479
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:59,280
So let me know when anything is confusing
because this topic is really important.

480
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,880
This is what
you will be using in your project.

481
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,960
And if you guys do not understand
this, it's going to be very hard

482
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:10,120
for you to do the actual project
because the doubt we have

483
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:15,840
you can all work in collaboration,

484
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,200
so all your attention should be here to do

485
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,520
this project.

486
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,800
That's that will be

487
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,160
okay.

488
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:46,920
Name name.

489
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:59,120
It's Solar System.

490
00:33:59,120 --> 00:33:59,720
Okay. Sure.

491
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:03,120
We will start at 1045.

492
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:03,440
Yeah.

493
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,080
Meanwhile, I just write down the request.

494
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:14,840
So basically
we are going to be doing a good project.

495
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,760
Okay.

496
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,720
With the name of the
project, one sort of distant

497
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:45,960
said.

498
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,040
One thing that I want

499
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,720
to mention before we jump into learning
branches and gifts and stuff.

500
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,480
So stuff

501
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,640
I'm going to take

502
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:58,080
very simple, good examples.

503
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:03,280
I'm not going to use any examples
from your test engine.

504
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,480
The framework, because

505
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,760
right now
the purpose is to get you guys familiar

506
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:14,400
with the case scenarios
and the actual purpose

507
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,680
of how to use this particular tool,
which is, okay.

508
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,960
So I'm not going to incorporate
some of the code which is,

509
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,560
which might confuse language.

510
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,280
You keep putting examples very simple.

511
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:25,680
Remember,

512
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,600
it is not about coding, it's about
actually learning how to use this tool.

513
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,800
So we will not be focusing on coding
even if

514
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,880
we are making any errors or stuff
like that.

515
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,520
Our whole focus will be
how Dave is working,

516
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,240
what are the concepts
that I will be teaching

517
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:46,800
in the end,

518
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,960
when once you have learned these concepts,

519
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:54,560
you will be very easily able
to apply them on kind of good.

520
00:35:54,560 --> 00:36:03,000
That's not going to be a problem.

521
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,640
Okay guys, so let's begin.

522
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,520
So the requirement that we have of
our project

523
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:12,680
is that we have to quickly apply
the basic structure of our solar system.

524
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,800
And let's say
this is only the task of one person.

525
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,600
So it was given to one person
and he would ask that he quickly

526
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,480
apply the basic structure and upload it
because that's the requirement for

527
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,040
the client.

528
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,120
So let's say Mike started working on that.

529
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,680
So what he is going to do,
he is going to open up his intelligent

530
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:40,080
and then he is going
to simply create a new class.

531
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,600
And what is the limit?

532
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,720
He is going to let the solar system

533
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,080
slide Is

534
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,120
the hierarchy.

535
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,880
So what do you guys just
what do we have in our solar system?

536
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:06,960
What are the necessities
and basic things that must be there?

537
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,920
Yes, obviously
you guys are to follow slowly.

538
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:19,920
So number one thing,
you must have a sun, right?

539
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,080
And we also should have the

540
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,160
we should have moon

541
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:33,240
and planets.

542
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:38,240
So these are very basic things
that a solar system does have, obviously.

543
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,360
But we are not going to go into that
philosophy as

544
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:46,000
we are going to have, you know, a lot of
conflicts and discussions over there.

545
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:52,560
Oh, yeah, planes
and they are planets, not planes.

546
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,360
Right.

547
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,360
Okay.

548
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,240
So this is my solar system

549
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,560
and it has sun, moon and planets.

550
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,720
So keeping it very simple, no black holes,

551
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:07,280
nothing else for the.

552
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:12,240
So in the main ones,
what are we going to do?

553
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:12,720
Right.

554
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:17,680
We are going to simply write
our very basic code, which is going to be,

555
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:26,440
let's see,
star system, what should we name it?

556
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,120
What should be the name

557
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:38,360
of our solar system?

558
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,560
Look, you

559
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,360
because that's going to make you

560
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:51,640
new for System of.

561
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,080
Okay.

562
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:53,800
Okay, guys.

563
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:58,560
So do you think that now
the basic structure is at least ready?

564
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:02,400
We have not yet decided
how many Sun, Planet and etc.

565
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,640
but we do know
that basic structure is very

566
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:15,440
we can make a comment right at this point

567
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,320
just to save the backup of the code

568
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,440
that we have heard until this point.

569
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,880
Like I'm assuming

570
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:28,640
that these specifications are very huge,
like this code was very complicated.

571
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,720
Obviously we are developing
a solar system.

572
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,800
It's not going to be that simple.

573
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,960
And in the main we are also expected
to have a very huge code.

574
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,040
So let's for the sake
of example, let's say that

575
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:48,960
the let's say that we
are going to make a comment at this point.

576
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:54,000
So I'm going to open up this an explorer,

577
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,480
go to my solar system

578
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,880
and create a new That's all right.

579
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:06,600
Get. Okay.

580
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:10,880
So I really want to ignore
this thought in and out.

581
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,600
Fine.

582
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:21,360
So what should I do?

583
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,880
Nothing. No, we are just.

584
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:27,160
I just said that after this,
we are going to make a comment

585
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:34,320
because I don't want to lose my promise
at this point.

586
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,760
So it's going to be touch dot

587
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,680
yet ignore.

588
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,480
This has created a file
and I'm going to enter

589
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,840
dot idea and out file.

590
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:53,160
I want you to know that.

591
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,000
Okay so now

592
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,760
we'll get in it.

593
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,400
We may still have an empty repository

594
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,560
after that.

595
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,040
Will do get status.

596
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,280
It shows me that solar system

597
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,360
that I am a source
C are going to be correct.

598
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,840
So this means that I'm successfully
ignoring my

599
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,600
get in and out file
that are going to be do so at this point.

600
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:47,160
Are you guys with me?

601
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,920
Okay, I'm doing great. Still, guys.

602
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,800
I want you guys
to be with me to follow me.

603
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,000
We should all be on the same page

604
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,880
because this example is really important.

605
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,960
It's like a real time project.

606
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,200
This is how you guys
are working in your group.

607
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,400
Then you should include again.

608
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,760
Yes, I should applaud again.

609
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,240
That's like pretty simple.

610
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:14,920
If even if the code doesn't matter,
time is okay, it's going to be positive.

611
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:25,720
But try to meet with it.

612
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,160
So yes.

613
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:27,440
Okay.

614
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,520
I'll open up my get ignore
and I'll open up my good. So

615
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,360
I have a site

616
00:42:33,520 --> 00:43:03,400
or something that they.

617
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,760
Okay, So are we good, All of us

618
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:13,360
start with ignore is working for me.

619
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,840
It's working for everyone else.

620
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,640
Most of five is not working for you.

621
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,080
Support is available

622
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,440
for whomever.

623
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,800
It's not working does support me.

624
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,640
Support is there.

625
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,320
Is there rest of there?

626
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,160
And by the way, if ignore is with touch
start being ignored.

627
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,400
If I can show you guys that's space.

628
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:36,160
Don't get ignored me come out.

629
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,880
Okay.

630
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:45,800
So if you type in the command,
it will work.

631
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,240
X y, you

632
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,200
okay?

633
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,160
So now what are we going to do?

634
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:59,000
We are going to be making
our very first kind of make.

635
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,960
Okay, so get at dot

636
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:07,920
and then get commit dash out.

637
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:08,160
Okay.

638
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:12,400
Now I'm
going to be working on a project, right?

639
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:19,200
So I am not going to be like
randomly just, you know, for myself.

640
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,200
I'm going to name them so that anyone new

641
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,640
who joins in on the project, he can also

642
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:30,320
I have a very good understanding
of what the comment is about.

643
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:34,760
So right now let's say that Solar System

644
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,960
basics specifications

645
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:46,640
added, and

646
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,920
I can see that

647
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,960
some features

648
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,360
now under development

649
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:06,320
Okay, so I've made my first commit

650
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:09,320
and it's still if I use get log

651
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:15,920
I'll be able to see it.

652
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,200
Okay let me know when you guys
what you guys have done to this point.

653
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:20,920
Up to that.

654
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,880
I'm going to

655
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:24,320
bother it.

656
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,240
I don't care for it to be that long.

657
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:30,760
Yes the commit message
guarantee of even 5 to 10 months.

658
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,040
Don't worry about that.

659
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,560
But obviously should not be.

660
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:36,960
That should be in the description,
but descriptive enough.

661
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
July one line is fine.

662
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,840
I'll show you the actual commits on the up

663
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:45,720
the zip freeze that we have
and you'll see how it works.

664
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:47,640
Okay, guys.

665
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:52,080
So it's very important that as we discuss,
we also draw the diagram.

666
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:54,760
So this is going to be our

667
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,000
first time

668
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:08,320
that we meet.

669
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,640
Dennis I just added the

670
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,200
I just did this.

671
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,120
I just added the project.

672
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:19,320
So I was expecting that
you guys are already familiar

673
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,760
with how you can read the comments.

674
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:23,000
So. That's right.

675
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:23,840
Okay.

676
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,240
So now we are going to talk about

677
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,680
what we have done.

678
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,680
So right now
we have made this one comment.

679
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,600
Let's call it C one.

680
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:42,000
Okay.

681
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,120
We're has discovered being made.

682
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,320
Do we have any branch right now?

683
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,400
Master Main on feature.

684
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,880
Have you created anybody?

685
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,200
No, we have not.

686
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,400
So if I sure you want

687
00:46:58,680 --> 00:46:59,320
this.

688
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:03,920
See this master, Master,

689
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,480
Master.

690
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,120
By default,
if you are starting your project,

691
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:13,640
then by default your branch is main

692
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:17,400
master.

693
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,600
Okay. By default the first branch.

694
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:24,360
Whenever you start working, it's master

695
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,360
is people you

696
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,760
now we are familiar with this information.

697
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,040
What is this? Right?

698
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,120
This is a comment.

699
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:45,640
It's a code specific to this commit.

700
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:50,720
It's the output which is me
and my email address, date and time

701
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:54,960
and what does this hat master represent

702
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:05,720
that represents
that this particular commit

703
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,880
is in the working directory right now?

704
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:10,080
Okay.

705
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:13,280
No, it does not
only want to meet this to me

706
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,960
nice header

707
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:27,520
pointer mask
or it can point to some previous commit.

708
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,280
Also right now

709
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,720
applying to some previous commit.

710
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,040
Yes. Okay.

711
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,560
So will that sort of yours.

712
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:41,840
It points to last time.

713
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:49,080
It would be correct then.

714
00:48:49,080 --> 00:49:01,400
No, it will not be correct and right.

715
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:01,640
Okay.

716
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:04,720
Let me quickly give you this example,
because I think a lot of you

717
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,920
are confused about this.

718
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,200
Okay. So let's say in this particular

719
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:16,080
branch master,
I see my head is pointing to C one.

720
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:33,840
What does this mean?

721
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:42,880
Quickly answer me as quickly.

722
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:55,560
What about the rest of you? We

723
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:57,200
have talk

724
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:05,560
about it right?

725
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,320
We have C 20.

726
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:09,320
I still had this one is the key one.

727
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:22,120
What does this mean? Yes.

728
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:25,800
Does It means that in working IP

729
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:32,840
we have c one.

730
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:37,360
Okay.

731
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:39,800
Now does not becomes a period.

732
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,200
It just means that in your working days,
you know,

733
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:46,080
your head is pointing to C one.

734
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:50,280
That's another discussion that becomes
apparent and then what to do with it.

735
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,720
But it's it's possible for you guys

736
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:56,880
to move your head back and get it.

737
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:01,560
You know, view
your previous comments that you have made.

738
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:04,560
It is possible
I shared the command with you guys.

739
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:07,520
I guess maybe I've ignored that in future.

740
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:11,480
You can try that up,
but it's possible for you to walk

741
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:15,400
through
the previous comments in the history.

742
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,760
So whenever had this blinding
to a particular command,

743
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:22,680
it means that that particular comment
is in your working directory.

744
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:28,480
And by default
it points to the latest coming right.

745
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:32,720
If you are not forcing it to blindly
either commit by default, it's going to be

746
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,440
it's going to meet.

747
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:36,160
Absolutely. Just kind of simple

748
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:41,480
makes sense.

749
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:46,720
So right now by default,
we are not forcing it to any previous one.

750
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,320
So it's going to be by default
on the latest coming.

751
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:53,200
So that is how it is working.

752
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:53,560
Okay.

753
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:56,040
So let's go back to this diagram.

754
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:59,720
And right now we have just made the C one,
only one. It

755
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:03,840
Yes, one.

756
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:06,160
We can move that back with us.

757
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,000
Yes, we can.

758
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,080
All we can do this.

759
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:11,240
I'll let you know.

760
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:14,240
Maybe if needed, but not right now.

761
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,200
I shared the command.

762
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,720
I'll shoot again, but not right now.

763
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:19,720
That's not important.

764
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,400
I don't want you guys
to be confused with it.

765
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,440
Okay? So.

766
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:27,400
Okay,
now let's start making our solar system

767
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:31,080
out of the sun.

768
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:35,640
Milky Way, dot, sun, z equals to one

769
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:37,720
Milky Way.

770
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:42,200
Dot moon is equal to two

771
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:46,120
and Milky Way dot planets

772
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:53,800
is equal to three.

773
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:54,640
Okay,

774
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:01,160
so now after this,
I guess my solar system is complete.

775
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:04,640
The basic structure is complete.

776
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,800
I'll run the code

777
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:09,560
and I'll say, okay, that's working

778
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:12,560
fine, working pretty good.

779
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,680
My requirement with the plan

780
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:18,240
set me that basic structure
of solar system.

781
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:27,440
It's complete,
so should have deployed now.

782
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,280
Yes, it's completed.

783
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:33,840
So I really want to deploy.

784
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:36,720
So what I'll do is I'll simply

785
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,960
make this final commit.

786
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,560
I'll say get that dog,

787
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,800
get commit dash and

788
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:53,080
the basic structure

789
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:58,920
is complete.

790
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:01,880
Okay, So now the basic structure
has been completed.

791
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:06,360
And if I do get logged,
it shows me to commit and had

792
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:25,440
Master is pointing to my latest coming.

793
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,560
Okay guys.
So this is what we have done so far.

794
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:30,000
Any questions that you guys have?

795
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:39,480
So this one.

796
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:42,160
Okay.
Everything good? I can show the time.

797
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:44,600
Up till now

798
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:48,480
we have not uploaded our code to GitHub.

799
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:51,040
Everything that we have done is local

800
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:55,200
to our own machine.

801
00:54:55,200 --> 00:55:00,840
We will send it to get help now
so that the end user, the client, can

802
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:06,160
use that particular code
to run his solar system,

803
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:10,480
which contains the basic specifications.

804
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:16,560
Does that clear?

805
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:19,200
Okay. So just

806
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:23,760
I'll have a five minute break
and then who is the problem with it?

807
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:28,200
So anyone who is left behind
please help out each other to come

808
00:55:28,200 --> 01:01:58,080
to this point
and move quickly to see my happens.

809
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:00,120
Okay, so

810
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:01,760
we have that.

811
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:02,520
Okay, guys.

812
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:07,600
So let's begin from very glad now.

813
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:12,600
Right now two commits have been made
and now what we are going to do,

814
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:16,720
we are going to have our code
on the GitHub, make it live.

815
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:18,520
So open up here.

816
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:20,520
We have a balance

817
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:22,760
and let's create

818
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:31,680
a new representative.

819
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:37,800
So I want everyone to create their own
repository on their own GitHub account,

820
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:41,760
name, Explorer system,
whatever you want to make it public

821
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:58,040
as call theater repository.

822
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:58,360
Okay?

823
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:01,920
Now what we need to do is establish

824
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:05,040
the connection
between our local and remote.

825
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:08,120
So for that purpose we use the command

826
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:11,120
git remote at origin with the address.

827
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,160
Right. So It's going to live here.

828
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:15,000
I can simply copy it.

829
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
But the good practices to type it down

830
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:22,080
because that's how you remember.

831
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:22,560
Okay.

832
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:26,160
So that remote at Origin,
the connection has established.

833
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:30,240
Now I want to make sure that a connection
has been established.

834
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:37,080
How can I check that?

835
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:40,200
Get the mode that that's perfect.

836
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:44,440
And if I want to remove this connection
and add another connection

837
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:50,120
of a new repository, can I do that?

838
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:53,000
If I want to remove this
particular connection and connect this?

839
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,520
But it would just be to another
new repository that I created.

840
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:58,960
And I do that. Yes.

841
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:00,760
Do you guys remember the command for that

842
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:05,320
project?

843
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:12,000
Okay, now,

844
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,720
now the command that is left for later
discussion.

845
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:16,920
I'll just told you that.

846
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:19,320
I'll let you know what that
What is this command for.

847
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:22,720
We'll be discussing that get branch

848
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:27,280
dash and main.

849
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:30,040
So what is this command for.

850
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:31,720
What's going to to

851
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:54,280
what is the purpose of this command.

852
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:58,800
So using this class we are naming

853
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:02,000
the boss
that we will be sending on GitHub.

854
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:04,360
We are naming it

855
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:07,400
main. So

856
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:14,080
okay, now can I name it any other

857
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:16,800
rather than me.

858
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:18,600
Cannot name it.

859
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:23,040
No branch or any and anything?

860
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:26,520
Yes, I can name anything but right now

861
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:28,800
what should I naming

862
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:31,440
name? Why?

863
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:35,400
Because this is my branch
which contains the basic

864
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:38,240
our system which I want to deploy.

865
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:43,000
So that's why remember
only that's why I'm naming it main.

866
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:49,080
Okay, so now we see that
the name over here, it changed to Main.

867
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:52,200
It means that
everything that we will be doing

868
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:55,800
now is going to be in the main
branch. Yep.

869
01:05:56,040 --> 01:06:02,800
I believe I can do that
using the same command.

870
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:06,120
Yes I can. If I use the same matter I can

871
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:07,680
master.

872
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:12,480
I mean are good reference
to the same branch, but GitHub is now

873
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:16,320
free to use the main instead of master.

874
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:21,600
So we will be using main.

875
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:24,280
Yes, you can change it if you want to.

876
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:25,600
You can change any.

877
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:31,120
But once you have uploaded it
then do not change the name yet.

878
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:32,120
Massive software.

879
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:34,920
But GitHub is looking more and more.

880
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:35,840
I mean

881
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:41,600
maybe because of Master

882
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:45,400
and the police to slavery that I'm just

883
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:52,840
guessing.

884
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:53,800
Okay.

885
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,680
So once we have executed it
this then the next come out.

886
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:08,680
What is that?

887
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:11,880
What is our next combat

888
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:15,120
get pushed that's new origin

889
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:19,040
Main Now can you just tell me that

890
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:23,200
what could happen if I just use get push,

891
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:27,880
let it work? No.

892
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:43,880
Can you tell me that it will not work?

893
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:47,880
The branch mean has no upstream branch.

894
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:49,360
It means

895
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:52,360
that the
boss that you are trying to push it.

896
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:56,640
This thing that I cannot find this branch
anywhere on the guitar.

897
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:02,920
So first of all, you have to create that
branch over there also.

898
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:06,920
So whenever you push for the first time,
you use get

899
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:10,880
pushed back to our origin main

900
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:14,640
and the next time you push
you can simply use force.

901
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:18,320
Now, does it make sense that
why do we have to use git push?

902
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:21,040
That's your main for the first time.

903
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:23,440
I hope that's the end now.

904
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:26,560
So lot of things would be making sense
to all of you now.

905
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:30,800
Okay, so that's done.

906
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:32,160
Very good.

907
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:34,720
Let me open up my

908
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:39,240
let me press it.

909
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:39,600
Okay.

910
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:43,200
Now I have one branch,
which is my main branch

911
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:50,120
and everything is there. Oh,

912
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:52,560
well, now, good.

913
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:56,680
That is because you have get lost
some of it.

914
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:58,680
Should we get Dash main

915
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:02,920
most of our.

916
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:05,480
Do you want me to repeat

917
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:14,920
that new origin?

918
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:19,760
Because the first time you tried to push
you have no branch

919
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:23,640
available on new and more
so you to create the remote branch.

920
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:26,000
Also you have to let it know that

921
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:30,680
the main branch has to be there
when you are pushing the very first time.

922
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:34,640
That's
you use get pushed out for the first time.

923
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:37,880
Next time you can simply use
get that get push.

924
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:40,880
It will work.

925
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:51,320
Okay, so to this one I will done.

926
01:09:51,320 --> 01:10:19,680
Okay, great.

927
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:20,840
Now let's do one.

928
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:25,200
Let's do get long.

929
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:29,040
What is this now?

930
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:29,680
What is this?

931
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:34,360
Or just let me.

932
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:36,720
It was not appearing before.

933
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:38,880
I don't see any. You just left me above.

934
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:41,040
But now I see this.

935
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:51,560
Why is it here?

936
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:55,120
Okay, so it is showing
us that in working directory

937
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:58,720
I would I local represent tree

938
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:02,600
and our remote repository

939
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:05,160
the boolean or synchronize.

940
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:10,240
So tell me if this origin slash me

941
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:13,200
was in front of this particular command,

942
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:17,280
then what would it have meant

943
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,600
if, for instance, less mean
what's in front of this particular commit?

944
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:32,720
Then what will it mean?

945
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:34,280
We did not was the last of it.

946
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:40,200
Yes, it means that.

947
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:44,400
Okay, I'll repeat again before just last
name is over here

948
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,680
instead of here it means that

949
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:50,400
our remote top of the tree is in sync

950
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:53,360
with the local only to this coming

951
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:57,440
and the last commit that is
there is not present overview.

952
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:02,520
Does that make sense to all of you?

953
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:06,600
Let me quickly
give you a pictorial representation also.

954
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:08,880
But can

955
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:17,080
so over here

956
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:21,640
you can see this
example that are just left master is

957
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:27,720
here we are as at master is above

958
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:31,440
this means that the one in this example
is always

959
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:34,960
synchronized with

960
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:36,640
the first commit and the second

961
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:41,920
is not the.

962
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:45,600
Yeah, a lot of times
are going to be to the door.

963
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:49,360
We now let's move

964
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:57,440
probably will be deployed our water system

965
01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:00,960
basically it was working perfectly fine
but what happened

966
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:04,920
our team did call in and he said that now

967
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:09,200
client wants you to work on the feature,

968
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:13,120
a new feature,
and he wants you to work on some.

969
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:16,280
He wants you to develop
that feature of this particular sort

970
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:40,720
of system.

971
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:52,080
Okay, So before we actually do that, let's

972
01:13:52,400 --> 01:14:06,360
see how it will be done.

973
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:08,640
So far.

974
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:10,440
Access to it.

975
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:18,720
What's that, Jimmy?

976
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:20,280
Are you going to fast?

977
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:27,960
I believe that you are going
to press. Yep.

978
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:29,560
Just go down.

979
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:35,600
We are not in a hurry right?

980
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:40,360
Yeah, I heard about it.

981
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:41,920
Do you guys want to break

982
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:47,400
before we let you have some?

983
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:49,920
Okay, so let's go for a break.

984
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:56,160
For how many minutes do you want?

985
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:59,520
But then let's make it 15.

986
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:00,200
Okay, let's.

987
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:03,240
Let's go for 15.

988
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:03,960
After the break.

989
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:09,000
We are going to handle this time.

990
01:15:09,000 --> 01:30:50,400
So it's 25, 35 and 40.

991
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:50,920
Okay.

992
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:53,680
So I guess that all of you are here

993
01:30:54,640 --> 01:30:57,600
and let's receive that very loud.

994
01:30:58,120 --> 01:30:58,480
Okay.

995
01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:03,360
So I task to start
working on a new feature set.

996
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:06,560
So first of all,
I want you guys to tell me that what

997
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:09,760
if I started working over here
and created a new

998
01:31:10,120 --> 01:31:23,680
which contains the feature,
so why should I not do this?

999
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:26,520
Why I should not start working on the mean
branch?

1000
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:30,600
The feature already exists.

1001
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:33,600
Does it?

1002
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:34,560
Regardless of that

1003
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:43,120
sun is there,
but the feature is not complete yet.

1004
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:50,120
It's just the sun.

1005
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:54,120
Yes, because the reason is
that while working on

1006
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:57,600
the main branch, I may

1007
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:58,840
disturb the previous code.

1008
01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:00,880
It's not going to be
that much simple, right?

1009
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:03,920
It's going to be quite complicated
to other muscle systems.

1010
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:06,320
So it's highly recommended.

1011
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:08,760
Never in fact not recommended.

1012
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:11,760
It's a must that you should never work
on a main branch.

1013
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:15,840
That's a no no.

1014
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:17,840
Okay. So what we will do,

1015
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:22,920
we will create a new branch
from this point

1016
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:28,560
and you will name it

1017
01:32:37,080 --> 01:32:38,560
feature son or son.

1018
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:39,240
What I want.

1019
01:32:39,240 --> 01:32:42,520
Let's name it just son.

1020
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:43,440
Okay.

1021
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:47,280
As soon as I create this box,

1022
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:51,080
all the code that is in see through

1023
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:56,280
it will take a snapshot of that code
and bring it into my new branch.

1024
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:58,840
So let's go ahead

1025
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:02,680
and do that now

1026
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:09,240
in parallel log after.

1027
01:33:09,240 --> 01:33:11,560
But in parallel to C2.

1028
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:13,920
Okay.

1029
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:19,000
So if I do give log,
my head is pointing towards

1030
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:26,120
this personal commit, right?

1031
01:33:26,120 --> 01:33:28,560
My head, this one,
he can do this, but he's not coming.

1032
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:31,920
So now if I do,

1033
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,320
if I create a new boss,
it would be created

1034
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:36,520
at this particular point from the head.

1035
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:39,400
It will be created for this point.

1036
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:40,720
So let's create a new box.

1037
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:42,120
And how do we do that?

1038
01:33:42,120 --> 01:33:43,440
Good.

1039
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:46,000
Branch one

1040
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:52,400
star.

1041
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:57,720
Okay, so running this command is going
to do what it's going to create.

1042
01:33:57,720 --> 01:34:03,360
The branch, the branches.

1043
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:04,120
Okay.

1044
01:34:04,120 --> 01:34:07,040
But I still the main ribbon over here.

1045
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:14,360
Why is that so?

1046
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:17,200
No, that's not the reason.

1047
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:20,200
That is for renaming.

1048
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:21,760
Exactly. So

1049
01:34:24,120 --> 01:34:25,080
once we

1050
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:28,840
have created the branch,
then we need to switch to that

1051
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:32,280
particular branch
in order to be able to work over there.

1052
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:36,400
So what we will do, we will switch to that
match using the command,

1053
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:41,240
get check out some

1054
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:46,480
not safe switch to work on.

1055
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:49,320
And now I can see, son,
we're going over here

1056
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:34,280
to you.

1057
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:36,440
How do you know it's lost location
you are in.

1058
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:38,880
It will be

1059
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:41,280
evident.

1060
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:43,960
It will be written in brackets or here.

1061
01:35:44,040 --> 01:35:47,600
Apart from that,
we also have a command for Mac users.

1062
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:49,040
I guess

1063
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:54,760
it branch.

1064
01:35:54,760 --> 01:35:58,520
And the one with this stack
is going to show you your current branch.

1065
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:03,120
Okay, so Mac users,
you can use this skip much.

1066
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:05,400
It's going to show you a street

1067
01:36:06,640 --> 01:36:08,000
son. It's

1068
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,920
actually the joker branch
to which you are checking.

1069
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:12,760
You have checked out

1070
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:16,520
right?

1071
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:17,480
Okay.

1072
01:36:18,120 --> 01:36:19,480
So tell this point.

1073
01:36:19,480 --> 01:36:24,400
Are we all good?

1074
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:25,160
Okay, great.

1075
01:36:25,160 --> 01:36:27,600
Now let's open up our intelligent.

1076
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:32,640
Do we have all the code that we had
in the last commit over here?

1077
01:36:32,640 --> 01:36:37,080
Do we have all of that?

1078
01:36:37,080 --> 01:36:39,040
Yes, we have.

1079
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:41,920
So now let's
go ahead and start doing this.

1080
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:44,120
Let's create a new class.

1081
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:46,880
Let's call it Sun

1082
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:52,200
now. Let's start working on it.

1083
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:55,160
So I'm going to write down

1084
01:36:55,160 --> 01:36:57,400
some Cool away here and

1085
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:06,520
I may have the heat

1086
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:11,240
temperature

1087
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:23,800
and radius.

1088
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:46,080
These are key features
that we will be assigned to our sun.

1089
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:46,440
Okay.

1090
01:37:46,440 --> 01:37:49,320
So first of all, I'm
going to tell you guys that

1091
01:37:49,320 --> 01:37:52,320
never, never

1092
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:54,200
do any additions

1093
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:59,360
to include you, okay?

1094
01:37:59,360 --> 01:38:03,200
Remember we discussed that
we are not focusing on the code, right?

1095
01:38:03,720 --> 01:38:04,680
So that would be strange.

1096
01:38:04,680 --> 01:38:19,760
It doesn't matter.

1097
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:21,280
Know, cancel it.

1098
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:21,880
Cancel it.

1099
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:26,280
Never had it from the intelligent.

1100
01:38:26,280 --> 01:38:36,120
Yes. Okay.

1101
01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:37,320
Now what are we going to do?

1102
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:41,720
We will go to our main code
and we will be adding our sun over here.

1103
01:38:41,720 --> 01:38:42,920
Awesome.

1104
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:46,920
So sun, what should we name our sun

1105
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:02,720
Solana.

1106
01:39:02,720 --> 01:39:16,040
Okay, Husband.

1107
01:39:16,120 --> 01:39:18,080
Well, that's okay.

1108
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:20,760
When you will be adding,
you already have added.

1109
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:23,840
So that won't create a difference.

1110
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:26,520
But next time,
please try to cancel that option.

1111
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:29,520
Okay, so let's get solar on it.

1112
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:33,600
Features Solana dot he equals to

1113
01:39:37,680 --> 01:39:41,160
Jones and let's say Solana dawn

1114
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:46,480
radius equals to

1115
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:54,400
Nicolas and Solana.

1116
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:58,800
Temperature is equal to

1117
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:02,760
Oh okay.

1118
01:40:03,480 --> 01:40:09,240
So to this point I'm all good.

1119
01:40:09,240 --> 01:40:13,200
Let me know once you are done with this.

1120
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,080
No, let it be like this.

1121
01:40:16,520 --> 01:40:18,080
You do not have to make string.

1122
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:20,480
Let it be an integer.

1123
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:35,280
I did that on purpose.

1124
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:38,400
Okay, so let's say that

1125
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:41,520
I was working over here
and I completed this feature

1126
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:46,320
and obviously it's not going to be
this like four lines of code. It's

1127
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:50,400
going to be quite a huge number of lines
which are going to be here.

1128
01:40:51,440 --> 01:40:56,440
And I ran the code.

1129
01:40:56,440 --> 01:41:01,120
I knew some features were working fine,
but a few were not working fine.

1130
01:41:01,120 --> 01:41:03,720
I was getting some errors,

1131
01:41:03,720 --> 01:41:08,640
so I decided to resolve this error.

1132
01:41:08,640 --> 01:41:12,000
But I don't know where the error is yet.

1133
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:14,680
We are assuming
that this is a complicated code.

1134
01:41:15,320 --> 01:41:17,760
Okay, so what should I do?

1135
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:21,640
I start manipulating things in this
in this code and, you know,

1136
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:25,680
try to resolve my error over here.

1137
01:41:25,680 --> 01:41:27,240
Or should I

1138
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:36,120
follow a different approach,
assuming that.

1139
01:41:37,160 --> 01:41:38,920
Okay, I'll repeat.

1140
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:41,640
Let's assume
that this code is very complicated.

1141
01:41:41,640 --> 01:41:43,600
There are 1000 lines in this code.

1142
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:47,000
Few of our features are working fine,
but few features are giving errors

1143
01:41:47,240 --> 01:41:51,240
and we want to resolve the error.

1144
01:41:51,240 --> 01:41:55,000
Okay, so obviously I'll want that

1145
01:41:55,200 --> 01:41:58,160
my whole remains preserve

1146
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:04,240
and then am also able to resolve the bugs
which are there.

1147
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:05,880
So what should I do?

1148
01:42:05,880 --> 01:42:08,360
First of all, I need to save the school

1149
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,440
right.

1150
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:13,880
First of all, I need to save this.

1151
01:42:14,280 --> 01:42:16,960
So for that
purpose I'll have to make a comment

1152
01:42:18,120 --> 01:42:18,680
on this

1153
01:42:18,680 --> 01:42:31,000
particular.

1154
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:35,400
So let's go ahead and commit
the code that we have written.

1155
01:42:37,160 --> 01:42:40,360
So one thing we should make sure of,

1156
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:43,560
we are on the same branch
on which we are working.

1157
01:42:43,880 --> 01:42:47,160
So I'm on Sun
and I'm going to make a comment on Sun.

1158
01:42:47,160 --> 01:42:50,280
So I would say get at Dot,

1159
01:42:51,240 --> 01:42:53,240
get comment on

1160
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:56,840
and what's the message

1161
01:42:56,840 --> 01:42:59,240
that I should place over here

1162
01:42:59,240 --> 01:43:01,160
feature Sun

1163
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:04,640
set items

1164
01:43:04,640 --> 01:43:11,880
to be resolved.

1165
01:43:11,880 --> 01:43:16,560
Now this makes sense that I mentioned
that there are still errors

1166
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:19,280
that need to be resolved
in this particular feature,

1167
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:24,360
and I'm going to tell you
why it's important to place this message.

1168
01:43:25,280 --> 01:43:27,640
You let me know what you that are done

1169
01:43:27,640 --> 01:43:38,640
to this point.

1170
01:43:38,640 --> 01:43:38,920
Okay.

1171
01:43:38,920 --> 01:43:41,760
Now, one of the intelligent thing to do

1172
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,640
before we start working

1173
01:43:45,640 --> 01:43:49,280
on, you know,

1174
01:43:49,280 --> 01:43:52,000
resolving the issue,
one of the intelligent thing to do

1175
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,480
is to push our branch

1176
01:43:55,560 --> 01:43:58,200
here the good to. Why?

1177
01:43:58,720 --> 01:44:02,520
Because it's quite possible
that one of my colleagues

1178
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:06,560
who has some extra free time,
he wants to help me out.

1179
01:44:06,600 --> 01:44:11,920
As soon as he sees my comment, he says,
okay, so he's having some problem.

1180
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:15,840
Why don't I try to help him out
and he can download my Branch

1181
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:20,360
on his computer and then try to resolve
the errors that I did.

1182
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:22,440
Yeah, really nice guy.

1183
01:44:22,440 --> 01:44:24,600
He is and she is.

1184
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:29,400
And that must be very right.

1185
01:44:29,400 --> 01:44:29,760
Absolutely.

1186
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:31,800
We are going to switch again.
So, you know.

1187
01:44:33,200 --> 01:44:34,680
Okay. So

1188
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:38,920
how do I send this now to GitHub

1189
01:44:50,640 --> 01:44:51,120
pushing.

1190
01:44:51,120 --> 01:44:54,400
Okay, so what does the command get push.

1191
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:56,040
Is it going to

1192
01:44:56,040 --> 01:45:04,040
get pushed.

1193
01:45:04,040 --> 01:45:07,320
Okay guys,
remember the concept that I told you

1194
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:10,200
that we use

1195
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:14,360
get pushed that you are in the main
the first time.

1196
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:17,960
So right now do we have any sun

1197
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:24,360
on GitHub?

1198
01:45:24,360 --> 01:45:26,880
Although we have the wrap
but we have only bright sun,

1199
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:29,880
so how will get know to which run?

1200
01:45:30,120 --> 01:45:31,840
It has to push.

1201
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:33,960
So right now will you get

1202
01:45:35,080 --> 01:45:44,080
push that you are original sun.

1203
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:48,320
And for those of you who are saying
different dash and that is for renaming

1204
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:51,320
the branch okay remember that

1205
01:45:53,880 --> 01:45:55,320
officer

1206
01:45:55,320 --> 01:45:57,880
everything combined upside to my GitHub.

1207
01:45:57,880 --> 01:45:59,760
Let me hear you were there.

1208
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:03,520
If I it.

1209
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:07,360
I see two branches

1210
01:46:07,360 --> 01:46:09,840
main and sun.

1211
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:10,240
Okay.

1212
01:46:10,240 --> 01:46:22,760
So is that the scenario with all of you?

1213
01:46:22,760 --> 01:46:28,000
Okay, now let me show you some
few things on GitHub before we move on.

1214
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:31,560
Resolving the error.

1215
01:46:31,560 --> 01:46:32,800
If I click on the sun

1216
01:46:35,240 --> 01:46:37,400
I will see the commit that is there

1217
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,480
feature sun with errors to be resolved.

1218
01:46:42,440 --> 01:46:51,120
It's the code that there.

1219
01:46:51,120 --> 01:46:54,760
Okay, I can switch to my main branch also

1220
01:46:56,040 --> 01:46:58,520
and it's to have its

1221
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:03,000
it does not have that particular comment.

1222
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:03,360
Okay.

1223
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:05,920
Now let's do one thing

1224
01:47:08,680 --> 01:47:10,640
let's create a new branch

1225
01:47:10,640 --> 01:47:14,280
at this point to resolve the issue.

1226
01:47:15,400 --> 01:47:17,080
Now let's name

1227
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:23,000
resolving

1228
01:47:23,640 --> 01:47:28,680
the issue are bug fix.

1229
01:47:28,680 --> 01:47:31,080
It's going to be more you know more

1230
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:35,880
good to name of this.

1231
01:47:35,880 --> 01:47:38,760
So we are fixing about

1232
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:42,920
okay now

1233
01:47:42,920 --> 01:47:46,680
I need to be very vigilant
that I am on the same branch

1234
01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:50,280
if I want to create a new branch
from over there

1235
01:47:50,280 --> 01:47:53,320
because if I create this

1236
01:47:53,320 --> 01:47:56,960
so if I create this branch but fixed

1237
01:47:56,960 --> 01:48:01,880
after switching to, it's
going to create a new branch complete. Do

1238
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:06,360
you guys agree with that?

1239
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:08,960
If I switch to Main branch
and then I create

1240
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:11,560
bug fixed, it's
going to be created from this point.

1241
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:15,480
But right now
you want to create a positive tree.

1242
01:48:15,960 --> 01:48:18,720
So I need to make sure
that I am to see secret.

1243
01:48:19,080 --> 01:48:21,160
So for that I can use get branch.

1244
01:48:22,040 --> 01:48:22,520
Okay.

1245
01:48:22,520 --> 01:48:25,160
So yes, I am on the sun

1246
01:48:25,560 --> 01:48:29,520
and now I can create a new branch
from this particular point.

1247
01:48:30,120 --> 01:48:32,960
In order to do that I said get branch

1248
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:37,760
but fix up.

1249
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:39,920
I'll press enter.

1250
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:42,040
I could create the new branch.

1251
01:48:42,040 --> 01:48:44,520
Now I need to switch to that.

1252
01:48:44,520 --> 01:48:47,880
So for that get shutdown

1253
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:58,400
but fix.

1254
01:48:58,400 --> 01:48:59,000
Okay guys.

1255
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:02,200
So I have successfully switch
to the branch

1256
01:49:02,640 --> 01:49:04,400
bug fix

1257
01:49:06,760 --> 01:49:07,600
and now what

1258
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:10,720
code is going to be there in the bug fix.

1259
01:49:10,760 --> 01:49:11,640
Get someone tell me

1260
01:49:13,560 --> 01:49:15,000
I open up the simulation.

1261
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,280
What code is going to be there
in the bug? Fix

1262
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:20,640
the copy of

1263
01:49:20,920 --> 01:49:23,560
the must see tree?

1264
01:49:23,560 --> 01:49:26,520
Yes. Perfect.

1265
01:49:26,520 --> 01:49:28,960
Let me open up my intelligence.

1266
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:30,680
Let me show you.

1267
01:49:30,840 --> 01:49:31,720
Yes. The task.

1268
01:49:31,720 --> 01:49:33,640
The same errors.

1269
01:49:33,640 --> 01:49:35,880
No. You know, I spent, let's say

1270
01:49:36,120 --> 01:49:39,720
5 hours working on this code,
trying to resolve the errors,

1271
01:49:39,720 --> 01:49:43,360
find different techniques,
changing the loose declaration stuff.

1272
01:49:43,800 --> 01:49:46,520
And finally, I was able fix

1273
01:49:46,520 --> 01:49:51,080
my error.

1274
01:49:51,080 --> 01:49:54,280
My error is fixed now.

1275
01:49:56,160 --> 01:49:57,960
Now, what should I do

1276
01:49:58,160 --> 01:50:05,800
once the error is fix? Yes,

1277
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:07,240
we are.

1278
01:50:07,240 --> 01:50:12,000
Obviously I run the code.

1279
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:16,600
Okay, so the first step is to commit it
on the same branch.

1280
01:50:16,600 --> 01:50:19,080
I need to commit it

1281
01:50:20,040 --> 01:50:21,920
so I'll be committing it

1282
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:36,120
in order to save it.

1283
01:50:36,120 --> 01:50:39,720
So let's
go ahead and commit this code yet and not

1284
01:50:41,160 --> 01:50:43,480
get comment.

1285
01:50:43,480 --> 01:50:44,320
That's

1286
01:50:45,120 --> 01:50:48,520
the issues in feature

1287
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:56,720
one has been resolved.

1288
01:50:56,720 --> 01:50:57,600
Okay,

1289
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:00,720
let me know once you guys are done

1290
01:51:00,720 --> 01:51:12,800
to this point.

1291
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:16,160
Okay, guys,
I'll like to mention one very important

1292
01:51:16,200 --> 01:51:19,320
help and one very important tip over here.

1293
01:51:19,320 --> 01:51:24,240
If you guys accidentally say the doubt
committed,

1294
01:51:25,560 --> 01:51:27,520
it's going to cause a lot of problems.

1295
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:33,200
First of all, get
will try to refrain from doing that.

1296
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:36,840
But in some scenarios
it may not be able to save you

1297
01:51:37,200 --> 01:51:40,760
and it might switch
you back to your previous launch.

1298
01:51:40,760 --> 01:51:42,760
And that is going to create a problem.

1299
01:51:42,760 --> 01:51:45,360
It will, you know, mix up all the codes

1300
01:51:45,360 --> 01:51:47,400
and then you will have to use testing and

1301
01:51:49,080 --> 01:51:50,240
complicated stuff.

1302
01:51:50,240 --> 01:51:53,280
So always make your code before

1303
01:51:53,280 --> 01:51:56,720
you try to actually

1304
01:51:56,720 --> 01:51:58,920
not not get it before

1305
01:51:58,920 --> 01:52:04,440
you try to push the branch.

1306
01:52:04,440 --> 01:52:06,960
Okay.

1307
01:52:06,960 --> 01:52:10,840
The beauty I'd like to mention
one thing over here.

1308
01:52:10,840 --> 01:52:13,800
Also, the beauty of branches is that

1309
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:17,520
let's say you are working on Future Sun

1310
01:52:18,480 --> 01:52:20,320
and there was still a bug

1311
01:52:20,320 --> 01:52:23,560
which had to be fixed,
but you had no time to fix it.

1312
01:52:24,360 --> 01:52:28,240
And meanwhile
a new feature is a high priority game.

1313
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:34,320
So you will leave this branch as it is
and you can simply create a new branch

1314
01:52:34,320 --> 01:52:43,160
out of it and start working on it
because that was a high priority feature.

1315
01:52:43,160 --> 01:52:46,040
So that that makes sense to us. You

1316
01:52:47,800 --> 01:52:50,640
that's how you can work on priority

1317
01:52:51,040 --> 01:52:54,600
and get your code is safe there.

1318
01:52:54,880 --> 01:52:58,800
You can simply start working
on some other high priority feature.

1319
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,560
So that's the power
and that's the advantage

1320
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:06,120
that it gives you.

1321
01:53:06,120 --> 01:53:09,600
Okay, so

1322
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:11,640
yes, for Hot Menu,

1323
01:53:11,640 --> 01:53:14,960
for that, you have to switch to Main
to create a new branch from over.

1324
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:54,680
Do exactly.

1325
01:53:54,680 --> 01:53:55,560
Yeah. There you go.

1326
01:53:56,640 --> 01:53:58,440
Yes, I'm in the past because

1327
01:53:58,440 --> 01:54:01,360
I have to move very stepwise

1328
01:54:02,440 --> 01:54:05,200
and I need to decide information
should I get

1329
01:54:05,200 --> 01:54:08,080
first and then, you know,
which information should I go second.

1330
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:29,720
So just making that in real time.

1331
01:54:29,720 --> 01:54:32,120
Okay.

1332
01:54:32,120 --> 01:54:35,200
Is there a way to see the hierarchy
of the branches?

1333
01:54:36,640 --> 01:54:39,760
Well, Mohammed, that is something

1334
01:54:39,760 --> 01:54:44,160
that I will be teaching you,
but that's a little bit complicated.

1335
01:54:44,160 --> 01:54:48,480
So whenever you are working on branches,
I'll always recommend

1336
01:54:48,480 --> 01:54:51,480
that you draw your branches on paper.

1337
01:54:51,680 --> 01:54:53,480
Okay, I'll recommend that.

1338
01:54:53,480 --> 01:55:00,440
It's a little bit complicated
when you go into the hierarchy.

1339
01:55:00,440 --> 01:55:02,960
Okay, So let's do gift log.

1340
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:08,520
At this point.

1341
01:55:08,520 --> 01:55:13,200
So we see that this is our master

1342
01:55:13,200 --> 01:55:15,440
branch and it is updated

1343
01:55:16,440 --> 01:55:19,920
on GitHub, This is our sun branch

1344
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:24,080
and it is updated to
but this boss does not have any origins.

1345
01:55:24,080 --> 01:55:27,080
Let me sorry, I just left properly.

1346
01:55:27,400 --> 01:55:33,960
Meaning that we do not have it on the.

1347
01:55:33,960 --> 01:55:35,120
Yes. So with that it will.

1348
01:55:36,200 --> 01:55:38,800
So do
you guys think that we need to send this

1349
01:55:39,480 --> 01:55:48,360
go back to beta?

1350
01:55:48,360 --> 01:55:50,520
No, we don't need that.

1351
01:55:52,440 --> 01:55:55,120
Okay guys, now what we are going to do

1352
01:55:55,120 --> 01:55:58,680
is something really, really important.

1353
01:55:59,800 --> 01:56:03,640
We are actually going to do a merge. Yes.

1354
01:56:04,680 --> 01:56:09,480
So because it's a bug fix
and we have fixed it on our local machine,

1355
01:56:09,480 --> 01:56:12,080
while we might only want above zero

1356
01:56:13,600 --> 01:56:14,600
GitHub, no need.

1357
01:56:14,600 --> 01:56:15,200
Right.

1358
01:56:16,440 --> 01:56:21,120
So it's also important
not to have redundant branches on GitHub.

1359
01:56:21,120 --> 01:56:25,720
All we have was branches
which are important for your colleagues

1360
01:56:25,960 --> 01:56:31,960
and for your own self.

1361
01:56:31,960 --> 01:56:34,920
Okay. Now merging

1362
01:56:34,920 --> 01:56:38,160
because we are done
with resolving that bug,

1363
01:56:38,240 --> 01:56:41,320
we want to merge

1364
01:56:41,320 --> 01:56:44,760
that particular commit to our sun branch.

1365
01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:45,800
Okay.

1366
01:56:45,800 --> 01:56:48,880
Now in our lives,
let me give you two steps

1367
01:56:50,760 --> 01:56:53,520
to merge a branch

1368
01:56:54,840 --> 01:56:57,200
switch to better and branch

1369
01:57:00,240 --> 01:57:03,280
use. Get

1370
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:11,040
once they love branch

1371
01:57:11,400 --> 01:57:23,760
you want to merge.

1372
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:26,520
Okay. So do not do the merge right now.

1373
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:34,560
First I want to explain shootings.

1374
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:34,920
Okay.

1375
01:57:34,920 --> 01:57:38,160
So the code in C3 and C4. It's

1376
01:57:39,240 --> 01:57:42,560
quite similar.

1377
01:57:42,560 --> 01:57:44,080
I'm going to copy this. Good.

1378
01:57:44,080 --> 01:58:01,440
From c4 of guys.

1379
01:58:01,480 --> 01:58:05,440
So this is the pool of C4.

1380
01:58:05,440 --> 01:58:07,960
I guess you would see it are two smart

1381
01:58:14,480 --> 01:58:19,440
oak and the code that we have in C3.

1382
01:58:19,440 --> 01:58:22,320
I'm going to place it here and it's just

1383
01:58:26,040 --> 01:58:27,680
this, right?

1384
01:58:27,680 --> 01:58:29,800
The rest of the classes are standard.

1385
01:58:29,800 --> 01:58:31,680
There is no other difference.

1386
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:37,160
Do you guys all agree with that? Yes.

1387
01:58:38,120 --> 01:58:41,280
Okay, so now let's

1388
01:58:41,280 --> 01:58:45,840
go to our terminal,
and the first step is to

1389
01:58:46,480 --> 01:58:47,880
check out

1390
01:58:49,960 --> 01:58:50,600
to Sun

1391
01:58:52,480 --> 01:58:57,240
and make sure that you are

1392
01:58:57,240 --> 01:59:02,160
on the Sun branch by gate branch.

1393
01:59:02,160 --> 01:59:04,680
That should show you that sun. The sun.

1394
01:59:05,480 --> 01:59:07,680
Now you get large

1395
01:59:10,320 --> 01:59:12,480
but fixed

1396
01:59:16,520 --> 01:59:17,560
and took

1397
01:59:17,560 --> 01:59:21,200
this command, run it and then let me know

1398
01:59:21,520 --> 01:59:28,920
and we can have a discussion on it.

1399
01:59:28,920 --> 01:59:29,200
Okay.

1400
01:59:29,200 --> 01:59:34,200
So first of all, I'd like to like to ask
you which branch is going to be there

1401
01:59:34,320 --> 01:59:39,200
on my intelligent.

1402
01:59:39,200 --> 01:59:40,520
It's going to be sun, right?

1403
01:59:40,520 --> 01:59:42,360
Because we check to it.

1404
01:59:42,360 --> 01:59:45,240
Let's open up our intelligent
and have a look at the

1405
01:59:47,800 --> 01:59:48,560
is the code

1406
01:59:48,560 --> 01:59:57,960
free of errors?

1407
01:59:57,960 --> 02:00:00,680
Yes, it is free of errors.

1408
02:00:00,680 --> 02:00:05,160
And for those of you who it's not for you,
as you might have not done

1409
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:10,320
anything correctly, I know which step
you missed, which step you did wrong

1410
02:00:11,480 --> 02:00:12,480
takes details

1411
02:00:12,480 --> 02:00:20,400
from the simple.

1412
02:00:20,400 --> 02:00:24,120
Okay, now what we are going to do
is we are going to discuss that.

1413
02:00:24,120 --> 02:00:29,960
What actually happened.

1414
02:00:29,960 --> 02:00:33,480
So let's read.

1415
02:00:33,480 --> 02:00:34,680
What does this say?

1416
02:00:34,680 --> 02:00:38,320
It says that updating

1417
02:00:38,320 --> 02:00:40,640
and the commit numbers.

1418
02:00:40,640 --> 02:00:42,560
Fast forward

1419
02:00:43,400 --> 02:00:43,800
fast.

1420
02:00:43,800 --> 02:00:48,520
So it is the kind of mode strategy
that it uses

1421
02:00:49,640 --> 02:00:51,360
on its own.

1422
02:00:51,360 --> 02:00:52,760
It's similar strategy.

1423
02:00:52,760 --> 02:00:55,640
So one of the months
that we will be reading,

1424
02:00:56,280 --> 02:01:01,200
we will be learning as fast power much

1425
02:01:09,520 --> 02:01:12,800
better did some insertions and changes

1426
02:01:12,800 --> 02:01:17,120
that is mentioning
that we are not interested in.

1427
02:01:17,120 --> 02:01:20,880
So now let's have a look
at the fast of That's

1428
02:01:20,880 --> 02:01:24,240
how it actually works.

1429
02:01:24,240 --> 02:01:26,840
So for now I don't need these codes.

1430
02:01:26,840 --> 02:01:29,880
I'll maybe meet them later, so I'll just

1431
02:01:31,640 --> 02:01:34,000
minimize that.

1432
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:34,640
Okay guys.

1433
02:01:34,640 --> 02:01:40,280
So it's now we will be learning faster,
much faster than most.

1434
02:01:40,680 --> 02:01:42,360
What happens is that

1435
02:01:44,840 --> 02:01:47,360
get sent me

1436
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:50,640
some branch which we are trying to merge

1437
02:01:52,840 --> 02:01:57,520
and places this comment

1438
02:01:59,040 --> 02:02:00,320
over here

1439
02:02:02,200 --> 02:02:03,560
and just you create it.

1440
02:02:03,560 --> 02:02:06,880
Start pointing towards C for

1441
02:02:09,080 --> 02:02:11,320
that's a fast,

1442
02:02:11,320 --> 02:02:24,640
slower, much.

1443
02:02:24,640 --> 02:02:27,320
Okay.

1444
02:02:27,320 --> 02:02:30,680
So in a fast follows what happens is that

1445
02:02:31,120 --> 02:02:35,360
get simply some of the branch
that which we are emerging

1446
02:02:35,640 --> 02:02:38,160
it picks up the comment on that

1447
02:02:41,120 --> 02:02:42,680
and the last comment

1448
02:02:42,680 --> 02:02:46,280
in the branch
to which we are merging starts

1449
02:02:46,280 --> 02:02:49,920
pointing to that particular commit
which is the final one

1450
02:03:03,080 --> 02:03:04,600
noble I'm

1451
02:03:04,600 --> 02:03:08,400
going to come to that of.

1452
02:03:08,440 --> 02:03:12,440
Is this clear to everyone
that what it is doing

1453
02:03:12,440 --> 02:03:17,400
right now?

1454
02:03:17,400 --> 02:03:18,080
Okay.

1455
02:03:18,080 --> 02:03:21,240
Now the discussion
that we are going to have next

1456
02:03:22,440 --> 02:03:24,840
is not, you know, necessary

1457
02:03:24,840 --> 02:03:31,680
it is not necessary,
but I will still have this conversation

1458
02:03:31,680 --> 02:03:37,200
with you guys because I really want you
to how this merger is happening.

1459
02:03:37,560 --> 02:03:40,120
You just you find it very complicated.

1460
02:03:41,320 --> 02:03:42,400
Just don't go deep

1461
02:03:42,400 --> 02:03:46,360
into that, okay.

1462
02:03:46,360 --> 02:03:54,120
So that's just a disclaimer
that I'm going to give you guys.

1463
02:03:54,120 --> 02:03:54,360
Okay.

1464
02:03:54,360 --> 02:03:57,480
So first of all, I'm
going to ask him a question.

1465
02:03:57,480 --> 02:04:01,920
So he stated that wasn't it better
if we didn't create fix

1466
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:04,320
but simply correct our code and submit

1467
02:04:04,920 --> 02:04:07,680
and commit in a spell in sound runs.

1468
02:04:08,040 --> 02:04:11,640
So how will you reply to Hammer?

1469
02:04:11,640 --> 02:04:12,560
What about you guys?

1470
02:04:12,560 --> 02:04:34,720
What what will you say to him?

1471
02:04:34,720 --> 02:04:35,520
Exactly?

1472
02:04:35,520 --> 02:04:38,800
So the answer is that I told you that

1473
02:04:39,160 --> 02:04:41,840
this particular code is just three lines,

1474
02:04:42,320 --> 02:04:46,280
but we are assuming it's a code
which has 1000 lines.

1475
02:04:46,280 --> 02:04:49,200
It's a complicated code
and we are unable to solve it.

1476
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:52,840
And some of the features are working,
some are not.

1477
02:04:52,840 --> 02:04:55,160
And if start messing up over there,

1478
02:04:55,160 --> 02:04:59,240
it may affect our other features
which are working fine, right?

1479
02:04:59,440 --> 02:05:01,320
And we don't want do that.

1480
02:05:01,320 --> 02:05:03,680
So that's why I created this scenario.

1481
02:05:04,080 --> 02:05:08,040
And as an example,
I had to do this for this simple good.

1482
02:05:08,400 --> 02:05:12,200
So right now our focus is not the code,
rather the use case

1483
02:05:12,240 --> 02:05:15,960
and how we can use
get to come to the solution.

1484
02:05:16,920 --> 02:05:18,240
I hope you're persistent.

1485
02:05:18,240 --> 02:05:28,400
Now. Okay, guys.

1486
02:05:28,400 --> 02:05:31,920
So let's talk
a little bit about Master Remus.

1487
02:05:32,560 --> 02:05:35,040
We will be doing
looking at this kind of merge

1488
02:05:35,040 --> 02:05:39,000
a lot.

1489
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:42,040
Maybe the Situation Company wants

1490
02:05:42,120 --> 02:05:46,160
to have a larger story
of all bugs and different specifics.

1491
02:05:46,200 --> 02:05:50,320
But trust me,
no company wants to have a branch

1492
02:05:50,320 --> 02:05:53,920
with the story of bugs
right there in the first place.

1493
02:05:53,920 --> 02:05:57,040
They want not have a
What they don't like is

1494
02:05:57,080 --> 02:06:00,120
they don't want to keep a story of that

1495
02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:04,680
above like.

1496
02:06:04,680 --> 02:06:08,120
Yeah.

1497
02:06:08,120 --> 02:06:08,960
Okay.

1498
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,120
So let me tell you

1499
02:06:12,600 --> 02:06:15,760
how good actually does this get.

1500
02:06:16,160 --> 02:06:19,600
Remember
The purpose whole purpose of using data

1501
02:06:20,640 --> 02:06:25,080
is that it is very effective

1502
02:06:25,080 --> 02:06:27,720
in the terms of managing your memory.

1503
02:06:28,440 --> 02:06:28,760
Right.

1504
02:06:28,760 --> 02:06:33,560
We discussed this in starting off,
but when we were discussing getting

1505
02:06:34,440 --> 02:06:37,640
the first class in the second class,

1506
02:06:37,640 --> 02:06:41,720
if you do it manually, this kind of stuff
is going to take a lot of space.

1507
02:06:41,720 --> 02:06:43,240
If you start to copy and paste

1508
02:06:43,240 --> 02:06:47,240
everything, get is very intelligent
and then we management

1509
02:06:53,960 --> 02:06:55,360
for harder

1510
02:06:55,360 --> 02:06:59,040
and then you are going to make do for us

1511
02:06:59,720 --> 02:07:01,760
just, just great

1512
02:07:02,160 --> 02:07:04,240
help you guys. So

1513
02:07:06,200 --> 02:07:08,720
this is very efficient
in memory management.

1514
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,520
So let me tell you what it actually does.

1515
02:07:12,440 --> 02:07:17,160
I'm telling you this because when you
looking at the law, you will be seen.

1516
02:07:17,360 --> 02:07:20,280
You will be able to see it

1517
02:07:20,280 --> 02:07:23,600
instead of placing this command
in front of people.

1518
02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:26,120
What in the US. Exactly.

1519
02:07:26,640 --> 02:07:29,280
It's simply after secrete, it

1520
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:31,680
creates a point to

1521
02:07:32,440 --> 02:07:33,760
and commits it.

1522
02:07:33,760 --> 02:07:37,200
Start pointing to this particular commit
which is on bug fix.

1523
02:07:38,840 --> 02:07:41,640
This commit is going to be there but

1524
02:07:43,320 --> 02:07:45,680
it will appear

1525
02:07:45,680 --> 02:07:48,560
as if after secret the next commit.

1526
02:07:48,880 --> 02:07:54,160
See for that's
how it is managing your memory.

1527
02:07:55,080 --> 02:07:59,880
So just a little
you know behind the scenes beads

1528
02:08:01,640 --> 02:08:04,200
but conceptually you do that

1529
02:08:04,200 --> 02:08:06,440
get you know moves this commit

1530
02:08:08,400 --> 02:08:10,680
down here and starts pointing towards

1531
02:08:14,640 --> 02:08:18,560
this is what we will say concept to

1532
02:08:20,400 --> 02:08:23,040
okay one more time I will.

1533
02:08:23,040 --> 02:08:25,080
So I said that

1534
02:08:25,640 --> 02:08:28,320
when we merge and a fast queremos

1535
02:08:29,640 --> 02:08:33,040
get behind the scene

1536
02:08:33,040 --> 02:08:34,560
after scene three

1537
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:39,240
it simply starts working towards see for,

1538
02:08:39,240 --> 02:08:45,560
this is what happens.

1539
02:08:45,560 --> 02:08:48,400
So that now what?

1540
02:08:48,840 --> 02:08:50,640
So that now

1541
02:08:51,120 --> 02:08:55,800
the sea floor does not have to make
a copy of it and place it inside of sun.

1542
02:08:56,040 --> 02:08:58,600
That's the reason to save memory.

1543
02:08:58,600 --> 02:09:00,480
But we will not go along with this.

1544
02:09:00,480 --> 02:09:04,440
Rather, we will say that conceptually
for our own understanding,

1545
02:09:04,440 --> 02:09:07,360
we will say that it simply moves
this commit

1546
02:09:08,640 --> 02:09:09,960
if of

1547
02:09:10,320 --> 02:09:14,720
this that you do all of you.

1548
02:09:14,720 --> 02:09:14,960
Okay,

1549
02:09:16,160 --> 02:09:19,000
so let's open up our console.

1550
02:09:19,680 --> 02:09:25,600
Let's clean everything.

1551
02:09:25,600 --> 02:09:28,120
Now let's do get long

1552
02:09:39,520 --> 02:09:40,160
now. Let's

1553
02:09:40,160 --> 02:09:43,080
try to see the number of comments
that we have.

1554
02:09:44,040 --> 02:09:49,760
We have one, two, three, four.

1555
02:09:50,760 --> 02:09:52,400
You have four comments.

1556
02:09:52,400 --> 02:09:56,400
And if I show you in the diagram,
how many more commits do we have?

1557
02:09:56,520 --> 02:10:00,560
One, two, three, four comments.

1558
02:10:01,200 --> 02:10:05,520
Right.

1559
02:10:05,520 --> 02:10:08,040
We have four commits in the diagram.

1560
02:10:08,040 --> 02:10:13,200
Also.

1561
02:10:13,200 --> 02:10:15,400
And if I show you

1562
02:10:15,400 --> 02:10:19,520
the latest commit
in which the issues in the Future Fund

1563
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:24,480
has been resolved, what it is doing,
it's pointing the hot sun

1564
02:10:25,080 --> 02:10:27,720
and the fixed Bo-Kaap

1565
02:10:27,720 --> 02:10:30,960
want to do the same comment

1566
02:10:33,360 --> 02:10:35,880
at sun and not face.

1567
02:10:36,360 --> 02:10:42,840
They are both pointing
to the same comment.

1568
02:10:42,840 --> 02:10:50,520
Is this to everyone?

1569
02:10:50,520 --> 02:10:55,680
Okay, so now I tried to,
you know, change the diagram a little bit.

1570
02:10:55,680 --> 02:10:58,760
Can I do this?

1571
02:10:58,760 --> 02:11:01,000
Because we are having four comments.

1572
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:09,480
So can I do this?

1573
02:11:09,480 --> 02:11:12,720
Not makes more sense. Right?

1574
02:11:12,720 --> 02:11:15,880
The sun is also pointing
to see for the last commit

1575
02:11:15,880 --> 02:11:18,240
and but this is also pointing to super.

1576
02:11:19,040 --> 02:11:19,480
Okay.

1577
02:11:21,520 --> 02:11:24,080
Now let me show you a

1578
02:11:24,400 --> 02:11:27,400
quick slide for

1579
02:11:27,840 --> 02:11:30,560
fast forward much

1580
02:11:34,440 --> 02:11:37,080
so this is how a forward must work.

1581
02:11:37,200 --> 02:11:39,880
This is one approach
and this is a separate launch

1582
02:11:40,560 --> 02:11:45,360
when the first problem happens
simply that second.

1583
02:11:45,360 --> 02:11:48,560
But that whole lot is right

1584
02:11:48,560 --> 02:11:53,400
in front of the last two,
which we are merging.

1585
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:57,120
So any number of commits
that are going to be there,

1586
02:11:57,240 --> 02:12:00,680
that branch are also going to be there in.

1587
02:12:00,680 --> 02:12:02,960
The grass to which we are merging

1588
02:12:05,800 --> 02:12:24,240
get does this to maintain history.

1589
02:12:24,240 --> 02:12:27,160
Okay, is this everyone?

1590
02:12:27,160 --> 02:12:32,800
Are we all good? Them

1591
02:12:34,520 --> 02:12:35,120
Great.

1592
02:12:35,560 --> 02:12:37,920
So now tell me a scenario.

1593
02:12:37,920 --> 02:12:39,360
Let's go ahead with the scenario.

1594
02:12:39,360 --> 02:12:43,680
What If our bug fix actually took

1595
02:12:43,920 --> 02:12:58,240
1 to 3 commits,

1596
02:12:58,240 --> 02:13:01,320
what if this was a sniper

1597
02:13:02,160 --> 02:13:05,080
and now we merged it to

1598
02:13:06,200 --> 02:13:08,280
the sun?

1599
02:13:08,280 --> 02:13:12,160
So tell me there will be key points to.

1600
02:13:12,160 --> 02:13:24,600
Battle this three point.

1601
02:13:24,600 --> 02:13:26,720
Okay. So what's what's the issue

1602
02:13:27,840 --> 02:13:32,280
and when did that read my exact
same words?

1603
02:13:32,280 --> 02:13:34,560
The exact same words.

1604
02:13:34,560 --> 02:13:38,080
This is the branch
and we created a new branch out of it.

1605
02:13:39,200 --> 02:13:41,760
When I fast forward
merge is going to happen.

1606
02:13:43,320 --> 02:13:46,400
The other boss,
all the commits of that branch are going

1607
02:13:46,400 --> 02:13:50,760
to be simply brought under the grass
to which we are merging.

1608
02:13:50,760 --> 02:13:52,840
These are the same exact words
that I said.

1609
02:13:53,880 --> 02:13:56,640
So now I'll ask the question again.

1610
02:13:56,640 --> 02:14:03,480
There were secret planning.

1611
02:14:03,480 --> 02:14:07,800
Yes, it will point to C4

1612
02:14:08,720 --> 02:14:12,840
and then there will be C five
and see all these commit

1613
02:14:12,840 --> 02:14:16,080
are automatically going to be a part

1614
02:14:16,080 --> 02:14:19,800
of Sun branch. Agree

1615
02:14:22,080 --> 02:14:25,920
it's going to be something like this. Now

1616
02:14:33,880 --> 02:14:37,560
now in your son branch the latest commit

1617
02:14:37,560 --> 02:14:41,360
it sees things and get all come and gain

1618
02:14:41,360 --> 02:14:43,920
deep history

1619
02:14:46,920 --> 02:14:49,480
okay I want your thumbs up
if you understand

1620
02:14:49,640 --> 02:14:52,680
faster much 100%

1621
02:15:00,520 --> 02:15:01,320
okay right.

1622
02:15:01,320 --> 02:15:09,200
It really happens.

1623
02:15:09,200 --> 02:15:13,160
Okay now one more concept
that we need to learn about.

1624
02:15:13,440 --> 02:15:20,400
Fast forward much.

1625
02:15:20,400 --> 02:15:22,360
So we said that

1626
02:15:23,120 --> 02:15:24,920
this was

1627
02:15:27,240 --> 02:15:29,560
the last summit

1628
02:15:29,560 --> 02:15:32,760
of garage

1629
02:15:33,200 --> 02:15:35,520
complete points

1630
02:15:35,520 --> 02:15:38,560
to the summit

1631
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:46,560
D child

1632
02:15:47,360 --> 02:15:53,320
march.

1633
02:15:53,320 --> 02:15:55,560
When does

1634
02:15:55,560 --> 02:15:59,200
a fast rather large happen in

1635
02:16:00,880 --> 02:16:02,280
Westminster?

1636
02:16:02,280 --> 02:16:06,720
When does a fast forward much have?

1637
02:16:06,720 --> 02:16:08,640
This is bottom

1638
02:16:11,040 --> 02:16:15,480
okay so a fast car loads is only

1639
02:16:16,440 --> 02:16:20,480
is only going to take place.

1640
02:16:21,240 --> 02:16:31,680
It's there and over here

1641
02:16:32,520 --> 02:16:35,200
when you created branch

1642
02:16:35,200 --> 02:16:37,760
and when we tried to merge it back

1643
02:16:39,320 --> 02:16:42,000
the history of that particular

1644
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:48,640
branch was not updated.

1645
02:16:48,640 --> 02:16:52,440
So we can see that
when this but textbook created

1646
02:16:54,840 --> 02:16:57,520
it remember that we see if the queen

1647
02:17:01,920 --> 02:17:04,520
now when you will be merging with logic

1648
02:17:04,520 --> 02:17:07,520
that is the history still see three

1649
02:17:09,440 --> 02:17:12,000
If the answer is yes

1650
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,640
it will say do the fast forward much

1651
02:17:33,240 --> 02:17:35,160
and that you

1652
02:17:36,360 --> 02:17:39,080
now let's consider another scenario.

1653
02:17:39,640 --> 02:17:42,920
And that that scenario
is that while we were working on

1654
02:17:42,920 --> 02:17:45,520
but fixed due to some reason

1655
02:17:46,400 --> 02:17:49,200
another comment was made on simply

1656
02:17:59,920 --> 02:18:02,560
this can happen right there right

1657
02:18:02,560 --> 02:18:04,640
this can happen

1658
02:18:06,680 --> 02:18:08,280
now tell me

1659
02:18:08,480 --> 02:18:12,480
when we tried to merge but fixed to sign

1660
02:18:13,200 --> 02:18:15,240
when I fast forward merge happen

1661
02:18:19,760 --> 02:18:22,080
get is going to check

1662
02:18:22,760 --> 02:18:27,840
whether the history is still complete. No.

1663
02:18:27,920 --> 02:18:32,840
Now the history has been updated
and it c files it will say no.

1664
02:18:32,840 --> 02:18:35,560
It's not simply no effect

1665
02:18:37,040 --> 02:18:43,320
for in this kind of scenario.

1666
02:18:43,320 --> 02:18:44,920
In this kind of scenario

1667
02:18:44,920 --> 02:18:48,600
another merging technique is used
which you'll be learning shortly.

1668
02:18:49,280 --> 02:18:51,440
Okay.
So what's your question? You'll be to

1669
02:18:52,760 --> 02:18:53,800
why we

1670
02:18:53,800 --> 02:18:58,640
should be the history.

1671
02:18:58,640 --> 02:18:59,280
Okay.

1672
02:18:59,280 --> 02:19:02,080
So when this was much this was created,

1673
02:19:03,480 --> 02:19:05,560
what was the history,

1674
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:07,840
the Latest is to

1675
02:19:10,880 --> 02:19:12,960
what you create

1676
02:19:14,400 --> 02:19:16,080
when we created this what what

1677
02:19:16,080 --> 02:19:18,760
the latest is basically

1678
02:19:26,560 --> 02:19:29,040
yes commit this free something.

1679
02:19:29,040 --> 02:19:29,520
Right.

1680
02:19:29,680 --> 02:19:33,240
Okay.

1681
02:19:33,240 --> 02:19:33,600
Yeah.

1682
02:19:33,600 --> 02:19:36,040
So that's why it's checking
that whether the history

1683
02:19:36,040 --> 02:19:39,240
has been updated or under new commits yet.

1684
02:19:39,960 --> 02:19:40,840
So history has

1685
02:19:40,840 --> 02:19:43,960
it's I'm going to interchanged these words
so don't be confused by it.

1686
02:19:43,960 --> 02:19:46,120
When I say history, I need comments.

1687
02:19:47,440 --> 02:19:47,680
Okay.

1688
02:19:47,680 --> 02:19:52,880
Is that understood to everyone
now that when a fast forward

1689
02:19:52,920 --> 02:19:55,240
merge will happen and let it flow on?

1690
02:19:56,400 --> 02:20:02,960
Is it clear to everyone?

1691
02:20:02,960 --> 02:20:04,520
Okay, very good. Great.

1692
02:20:04,520 --> 02:20:08,080
So let's go down to the scenario
which we were discussing,

1693
02:20:08,520 --> 02:20:11,280
and that's the current situation
of our everything

1694
02:20:11,280 --> 02:20:46,600
right.

1695
02:20:46,600 --> 02:20:47,000
Okay.

1696
02:20:48,240 --> 02:20:48,920
Now if you

1697
02:20:48,920 --> 02:20:52,000
want to leave bug fix,
we can simply delete that.

1698
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,240
And from that we have a command.

1699
02:20:54,240 --> 02:20:56,240
What's, what's that?

1700
02:20:56,240 --> 02:21:11,440
And someone tell me delete a branch,
get lost ASCII

1701
02:21:11,520 --> 02:21:27,600
and the name.

1702
02:21:27,600 --> 02:21:32,280
Okay, so we deleted the branch
but fix and it's gone.

1703
02:21:32,840 --> 02:21:36,960
Now. If I do get branch
it only two branches

1704
02:21:36,960 --> 02:21:39,720
which is main and some

1705
02:21:43,880 --> 02:21:47,760
and my code is still intact.

1706
02:21:47,760 --> 02:21:49,760
Okay. No, this guy's a left.

1707
02:21:49,760 --> 02:21:56,840
He wants to get done with it.

1708
02:21:56,840 --> 02:21:59,680
Yes. Delete the branch

1709
02:21:59,680 --> 02:22:01,400
and no.

1710
02:22:01,400 --> 02:22:03,400
Then get done with it.

1711
02:22:03,400 --> 02:22:06,680
So now if I want to remove this

1712
02:22:06,680 --> 02:22:09,600
bug fixed,
I'll simply delete it from over here

1713
02:22:10,920 --> 02:22:12,360
like this

1714
02:22:12,920 --> 02:22:17,400
as this c for going to be the error,
delete it.

1715
02:22:17,400 --> 02:22:20,000
I'm not

1716
02:22:22,320 --> 02:22:24,200
going to be there, but

1717
02:22:27,480 --> 02:22:27,840
okay.

1718
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:30,840
Let me open up my

1719
02:22:32,760 --> 02:22:36,120
logs so get logged

1720
02:22:37,520 --> 02:22:38,240
in the log.

1721
02:22:38,240 --> 02:22:41,240
I see that the sun is pointing

1722
02:22:41,240 --> 02:22:44,240
to this particular command
that is in the feature.

1723
02:22:44,240 --> 02:22:49,080
Some have been resolved,
but My origin sun is on the commit

1724
02:22:49,720 --> 02:22:52,200
feature sun As to the result,
what does this

1725
02:22:52,200 --> 02:23:12,080
mean?

1726
02:23:12,080 --> 02:23:25,680
There there there was said.

1727
02:23:25,680 --> 02:23:27,320
Okay, I'm going to repeat my question.

1728
02:23:27,320 --> 02:23:30,080
My question is that had

1729
02:23:31,440 --> 02:23:34,880
sun is here

1730
02:23:35,160 --> 02:23:38,280
like on the last commit that we need

1731
02:23:38,520 --> 02:23:42,000
which is the issue issue in feature
set have been resolved

1732
02:23:42,280 --> 02:23:47,280
but not urgent sun is to be just sun
with address to be resolved.

1733
02:23:47,680 --> 02:23:53,600
So what does it mean?

1734
02:23:53,600 --> 02:23:56,880
Yes, that means that

1735
02:23:57,040 --> 02:24:01,160
on GitHub the branch sun is only updated

1736
02:24:01,640 --> 02:24:07,640
to this particular command
and this command is not yet updated or do

1737
02:24:08,320 --> 02:24:10,920
so if you want to update on Origin

1738
02:24:10,920 --> 02:24:16,040
slash sun, which is a more transitory,
we should push this coming out

1739
02:24:16,040 --> 02:24:19,320
so that we know who that which command

1740
02:24:19,320 --> 02:24:30,560
am I going to use.

1741
02:24:30,560 --> 02:24:34,640
Get pushed simply that it's going to work.

1742
02:24:35,200 --> 02:24:39,240
So you good that you were asking that
ideally we should delete the branch one

1743
02:24:39,360 --> 02:24:40,160
what's most

1744
02:24:41,280 --> 02:24:42,320
obvious so you'll be that is

1745
02:24:42,320 --> 02:24:47,000
asking that should be deleted
a branch once it's most.

1746
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:50,240
Well this totally depends upon you guys.

1747
02:24:50,240 --> 02:24:52,760
Like I do not need that launch right now.

1748
02:24:52,760 --> 02:24:54,760
It's like I resolve the error.

1749
02:24:54,760 --> 02:24:57,200
I deleted it. Right.

1750
02:24:57,200 --> 02:25:00,640
But most probably I will not be meeting
future sun

1751
02:25:01,120 --> 02:25:05,280
until I have a doubt
that there might be some new features

1752
02:25:05,280 --> 02:25:09,680
that are changes that I still need to make
in this particular branch.

1753
02:25:10,080 --> 02:25:14,120
So even if you don't believe it,
it doesn't matter.

1754
02:25:14,120 --> 02:25:14,600
It's not.

1755
02:25:14,600 --> 02:25:17,240
We do like we Contagios
just keep it local.

1756
02:25:17,520 --> 02:25:24,800
Don't send it during more.

1757
02:25:24,800 --> 02:25:26,800
Okay. Now to two branches.

1758
02:25:27,920 --> 02:25:30,680
May and sun are there

1759
02:25:30,680 --> 02:25:35,040
perfect.

1760
02:25:35,040 --> 02:25:35,600
Okay guys.

1761
02:25:35,600 --> 02:25:37,800
So let's have a look
at the requirements again.

1762
02:25:39,080 --> 02:25:40,600
The requirement said that

1763
02:25:43,560 --> 02:25:44,720
we are committed to Sun.

1764
02:25:44,720 --> 02:25:47,080
How we can that feature

1765
02:25:47,080 --> 02:25:53,000
successfully We can begin to.

1766
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:53,760
Yes, we have.

1767
02:25:53,760 --> 02:25:56,320
So now

1768
02:25:56,920 --> 02:26:08,480
what should we do?

1769
02:26:08,480 --> 02:26:11,280
This domain and merge.

1770
02:26:11,400 --> 02:26:15,480
Okay, so here is a rule
that I'm going to tell you.

1771
02:26:15,480 --> 02:26:20,400
Never merge to Main branch.

1772
02:26:20,400 --> 02:26:24,000
Okay, So that's the rule
that you have to implement by heart.

1773
02:26:25,360 --> 02:26:27,640
And a lot of you

1774
02:26:28,400 --> 02:26:31,520
a lot of you are going
do this and good projects.

1775
02:26:31,520 --> 02:26:34,720
You are going to merge in me
and then you request me

1776
02:26:35,160 --> 02:26:40,360
to create a new project for you guys
because I cannot undo that.

1777
02:26:40,360 --> 02:26:41,280
Okay?

1778
02:26:41,560 --> 02:26:44,280
It will not be possible
for me to undo your merge.

1779
02:26:45,440 --> 02:26:47,920
So I'm again mentioning it.

1780
02:26:48,600 --> 02:26:53,160
Please, none of you should merge

1781
02:26:53,320 --> 02:26:55,600
or push in the master.

1782
02:26:56,960 --> 02:27:01,440
That's a humble request because that is
going to cost you and me a lot of effort.

1783
02:27:01,680 --> 02:27:06,120
I won't be able to merge.

1784
02:27:06,120 --> 02:27:07,400
Does that you to all of you

1785
02:27:09,480 --> 02:27:12,000
write it down on a notepad

1786
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:16,040
it on just please do whatever
make whatever out of it

1787
02:27:16,800 --> 02:27:19,360
and have it pasted on your desktop. Me

1788
02:27:26,160 --> 02:27:26,800
Oh yeah.

1789
02:27:29,280 --> 02:27:32,160
We only system mean and continue
with the project.

1790
02:27:32,160 --> 02:27:34,680
No, you never work in me.
I was working in May.

1791
02:27:34,680 --> 02:27:39,680
Now once we uploaded the basic structure
have we yet worked on mean?

1792
02:27:40,880 --> 02:27:42,920
No. We will ever be working on me.

1793
02:27:43,400 --> 02:27:48,720
Never.

1794
02:27:48,720 --> 02:27:52,160
Okay, so now I'm going to teach you
that procedure.

1795
02:27:53,760 --> 02:27:55,800
Yes. Come on, dude, just.

1796
02:27:56,120 --> 02:28:02,520
Just give me some time.

1797
02:28:02,520 --> 02:28:04,800
We have to.
But they are the other requirements.

1798
02:28:04,800 --> 02:28:06,320
Can you show me the step where you merge?

1799
02:28:06,320 --> 02:28:08,600
But fix that sun

1800
02:28:12,240 --> 02:28:14,040
No, Muhammad Unfortunately,

1801
02:28:14,040 --> 02:28:19,840
I don't have that.

1802
02:28:19,840 --> 02:28:29,360
But so you just missed the whole fun part.

1803
02:28:29,360 --> 02:28:33,080
Okay,
So let's go ahead and do this cool request

1804
02:28:33,080 --> 02:28:36,480
and let's see that what what happens.

1805
02:28:38,160 --> 02:28:40,560
So now I was working on this feature.

1806
02:28:40,560 --> 02:28:43,920
I'm done.
And I'm sure that's working fine.

1807
02:28:43,920 --> 02:28:48,160
I'll say, okay,
I want it to be merged to me.

1808
02:28:48,160 --> 02:28:53,920
So for that purpose, what we do
is we go to create a pull request.

1809
02:28:53,920 --> 02:28:55,200
So what's a pull requests?

1810
02:28:55,200 --> 02:28:57,960
Upload request is a request to the

1811
02:28:59,280 --> 02:29:01,640
person who is

1812
02:29:01,640 --> 02:29:04,680
in charge of merging the branches

1813
02:29:05,160 --> 02:29:09,720
to merge the branch
that we are requesting.

1814
02:29:11,320 --> 02:29:12,880
So open up

1815
02:29:12,880 --> 02:29:16,200
the pull request
and then it'll set new pull request.

1816
02:29:16,200 --> 02:29:22,800
So we are creating a new pull request.

1817
02:29:22,800 --> 02:29:23,760
Okay.

1818
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,800
So which is going to be our

1819
02:29:26,800 --> 02:29:36,360
base branch, it's going to be made

1820
02:29:36,840 --> 02:29:42,600
and which is going to be our branch
which we want to merge.

1821
02:29:42,600 --> 02:29:48,440
That's going to be sun.

1822
02:29:48,440 --> 02:29:49,760
Okay. After that

1823
02:29:51,680 --> 02:29:52,720
it is also would

1824
02:29:52,720 --> 02:29:55,160
show us the difference
that we have in the files.

1825
02:29:56,680 --> 02:30:00,040
We have like some additional records
in this file

1826
02:30:00,040 --> 02:30:02,440
and some of these records in a new file

1827
02:30:03,120 --> 02:30:05,760
that's visible to us on GitHub.

1828
02:30:05,760 --> 02:30:08,040
And then you say

1829
02:30:10,640 --> 02:30:13,480
create upload request.

1830
02:30:13,480 --> 02:30:14,400
Okay.

1831
02:30:14,880 --> 02:30:17,640
After clicking on create upload request,

1832
02:30:17,640 --> 02:30:20,760
we will write something over here

1833
02:30:22,840 --> 02:30:23,560
after

1834
02:30:58,200 --> 02:31:00,440
the week is posted a message

1835
02:31:01,160 --> 02:31:04,880
and then it will go to review. Is

1836
02:31:05,800 --> 02:31:06,480
over here.

1837
02:31:06,480 --> 02:31:10,920
We are going to assign it
to some anyone to review.

1838
02:31:11,880 --> 02:31:15,520
Now I do not have any person
working on this requisite

1839
02:31:15,520 --> 02:31:18,720
to give me the all user
so I cannot see anything.

1840
02:31:19,240 --> 02:31:20,160
Okay.

1841
02:31:20,160 --> 02:31:23,680
But when you will be working on
collaboration, you will see the username

1842
02:31:23,680 --> 02:31:26,040
which you can

1843
02:31:27,600 --> 02:31:29,040
assign it to.

1844
02:31:30,400 --> 02:31:32,800
Yes, I, I have done that.

1845
02:31:32,800 --> 02:31:34,920
Asylees here on set you will

1846
02:31:34,920 --> 02:31:39,160
the people you want to assign it
to labels.

1847
02:31:39,800 --> 02:31:45,200
It's a bug, it's a documentation, it's
a duplicate enhancement.

1848
02:31:45,200 --> 02:31:45,720
For me.

1849
02:31:45,720 --> 02:31:48,480
I would say it's an enhancement, right?

1850
02:31:48,480 --> 02:31:50,400
It's a new feature.

1851
02:31:50,520 --> 02:31:54,680
So I placed it
in the label Enhancement Project.

1852
02:31:54,680 --> 02:31:57,200
I do not have any project name off.

1853
02:31:57,240 --> 02:31:59,640
Let's just keep it empty.

1854
02:31:59,640 --> 02:32:01,120
Milestone.

1855
02:32:01,120 --> 02:32:02,960
Nothing like this.

1856
02:32:02,960 --> 02:32:04,440
You know.

1857
02:32:04,440 --> 02:32:09,160
Okay, so after that,
simply click on Create for request.

1858
02:32:09,160 --> 02:32:12,840
So now time you guys ask me
about these things that we discussed.

1859
02:32:12,840 --> 02:32:16,920
What I did review is assigns labels
projects.

1860
02:32:17,520 --> 02:32:18,680
Yes. Okay, good.

1861
02:32:18,680 --> 02:32:25,240
And just simply click on Create requests.

1862
02:32:25,240 --> 02:32:25,760
Okay.

1863
02:32:25,760 --> 02:32:30,680
After that, just click on Little System
again and go back to your main branch.

1864
02:32:31,600 --> 02:32:45,720
Let me know what you have done.

1865
02:32:45,720 --> 02:32:47,240
Now, what will happen?

1866
02:32:47,240 --> 02:32:53,560
A notification will go to the owner of
the app, the who is in charge of merging.

1867
02:32:53,560 --> 02:32:55,960
You'll see that there is a pull request.

1868
02:32:56,960 --> 02:32:58,680
We will see

1869
02:32:59,040 --> 02:33:01,320
pull request one

1870
02:33:03,120 --> 02:33:06,480
will simply click on that.

1871
02:33:06,520 --> 02:33:07,920
It will show us that

1872
02:33:07,920 --> 02:33:11,720
there is a pull request
which is of design.

1873
02:33:12,120 --> 02:33:15,520
And if I put my point over the

1874
02:33:15,560 --> 02:33:21,480
it shows me the message and shows me that
which what do I want to merge?

1875
02:33:21,480 --> 02:33:24,960
I simply open it.

1876
02:33:24,960 --> 02:33:28,280
I say, okay,
so this is the conversation that we have.

1877
02:33:28,680 --> 02:33:31,400
These are the two comments
that this bunch has.

1878
02:33:31,920 --> 02:33:38,320
And I would say, okay, let's do thing,

1879
02:33:38,320 --> 02:33:41,760
let's have a look at files.

1880
02:33:41,840 --> 02:33:43,840
So I'll have a look at the code.

1881
02:33:45,120 --> 02:33:47,200
I'll say, okay, working fine.

1882
02:33:47,280 --> 02:33:49,960
It seems to be working fine.

1883
02:33:49,960 --> 02:33:53,160
I'm not yet, you know, run the school.

1884
02:33:53,720 --> 02:33:58,120
So it totally depends upon me now
how much I trust the person

1885
02:33:58,760 --> 02:34:03,040
who has said the code.

1886
02:34:03,040 --> 02:34:06,840
I can either download it
on my own system, run it,

1887
02:34:06,840 --> 02:34:12,240
and then choose to merge,
or if I trust that person,

1888
02:34:12,240 --> 02:34:17,200
I would just have a hard
look at it but not actually run it.

1889
02:34:18,120 --> 02:34:20,680
And just much
so that totally depends upon me.

1890
02:34:20,680 --> 02:34:24,840
Also you both methods how to do that,
because I do recommend

1891
02:34:25,080 --> 02:34:29,800
that whenever you are merging
in your work projects out of the command

1892
02:34:29,800 --> 02:34:33,760
that you always do not trust
but verify before much.

1893
02:34:34,440 --> 02:34:36,120
So right now I trust myself.

1894
02:34:36,120 --> 02:34:40,160
This code is pretty simple,
so I'll say Yeah, good, good jobs.

1895
02:34:40,760 --> 02:34:46,880
I say go to the commit.

1896
02:34:46,880 --> 02:34:50,200
And over here I see multiple requests

1897
02:34:52,680 --> 02:34:54,400
and then I'll say

1898
02:34:54,400 --> 02:34:58,360
confirm loads.

1899
02:34:58,360 --> 02:35:02,200
So what we did, we most of the branch

1900
02:35:04,240 --> 02:35:06,800
into our main branch

1901
02:35:07,440 --> 02:35:10,920
and if I show you now the latest commit is

1902
02:35:10,920 --> 02:35:13,680
the issue in the feature
son have been resolved

1903
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,560
and it contains all the complete code

1904
02:35:16,840 --> 02:35:20,920
and the new feature of Sun.

1905
02:35:20,920 --> 02:35:25,200
No, you cannot tested on GitHub.

1906
02:35:25,200 --> 02:35:27,120
Which version do you want me to repeat?

1907
02:35:27,120 --> 02:35:31,240
Because we are.

1908
02:35:31,240 --> 02:35:32,560
I said a lot of things.

1909
02:35:32,560 --> 02:35:33,360
You have to code.

1910
02:35:33,360 --> 02:35:42,880
Which one do you want me to repeat?

1911
02:35:42,880 --> 02:35:45,120
The whole request

1912
02:35:52,680 --> 02:35:53,160
offer.

1913
02:35:53,160 --> 02:35:55,480
Click on what the request has gone.

1914
02:35:55,480 --> 02:35:58,800
That's I was a little slow
when we were able to follow

1915
02:35:58,800 --> 02:36:02,280
what I did.

1916
02:36:02,280 --> 02:36:04,720
Why was a fast

1917
02:36:10,400 --> 02:36:17,920
I Unfortunately, the pull request is gone.

1918
02:36:17,920 --> 02:36:19,120
It cannot be undone.

1919
02:36:19,120 --> 02:36:23,760
I told you, but I'll let you.

1920
02:36:23,760 --> 02:36:24,680
Let's do this.

1921
02:36:26,040 --> 02:36:27,240
I created dummy branch.

1922
02:36:27,240 --> 02:36:27,920
Okay.

1923
02:36:28,320 --> 02:36:29,400
No, no, no.

1924
02:36:29,400 --> 02:36:40,120
I'll create a dummy by five five.

1925
02:36:40,120 --> 02:36:41,640
Okay. But

1926
02:36:42,480 --> 02:36:44,520
no one is going to follow me on this.

1927
02:36:44,840 --> 02:36:46,440
I sure am.

1928
02:36:46,440 --> 02:36:48,600
I hear about it.

1929
02:36:50,080 --> 02:36:52,040
In fact, let me use this.

1930
02:36:52,040 --> 02:36:54,240
This. This picture. I think that's good.

1931
02:36:55,600 --> 02:36:58,800
Okay, so you guys have done it
on this one, right?

1932
02:36:59,640 --> 02:37:09,040
No one is behind this.

1933
02:37:09,040 --> 02:37:14,760
So. Okay, That is is behind this.

1934
02:37:16,680 --> 02:37:16,920
Okay.

1935
02:37:16,920 --> 02:37:20,200
So those of you who are over here,
you need to click on conversation.

1936
02:37:21,280 --> 02:37:22,040
Okay?

1937
02:37:22,040 --> 02:37:24,040
Once you click on conversation,

1938
02:37:25,560 --> 02:37:27,240
you will see

1939
02:37:28,400 --> 02:37:32,760
this particular picture.

1940
02:37:32,760 --> 02:37:36,120
And from this picture
you need to simply click

1941
02:37:36,120 --> 02:37:39,280
on most full request and confirm it.

1942
02:37:39,560 --> 02:37:41,520
It will pull it.

1943
02:37:41,520 --> 02:37:49,680
Okay, So

1944
02:37:49,680 --> 02:37:56,600
let me know if it's done for all of you.

1945
02:37:56,600 --> 02:37:58,920
How to open up the pool request.

1946
02:37:58,920 --> 02:38:00,560
Simply click on pool request

1947
02:38:01,680 --> 02:38:04,920
and there will be a pull request

1948
02:38:04,920 --> 02:38:06,920
on that and it will open up

1949
02:38:06,920 --> 02:38:10,600
the pool request.

1950
02:38:10,600 --> 02:38:13,040
I thought that I was going to look

1951
02:38:14,160 --> 02:38:15,800
honestly, I caught that.

1952
02:38:15,800 --> 02:38:18,440
But unfortunately, I think that I

1953
02:38:21,360 --> 02:38:23,200
underestimated

1954
02:38:25,200 --> 02:38:26,680
or maybe something

1955
02:38:26,680 --> 02:38:32,240
I don't know.

1956
02:38:32,240 --> 02:38:33,720
Yeah, okay.

1957
02:38:33,880 --> 02:38:39,280
I don't really need it yet.

1958
02:38:39,280 --> 02:38:42,960
You know, I was not asked that.

1959
02:38:42,960 --> 02:38:44,760
That cannot be true.

1960
02:38:44,760 --> 02:38:47,160
I'm sure about it.

1961
02:38:47,160 --> 02:38:48,960
Okay, let's do our morning.

1962
02:38:48,960 --> 02:38:51,600
So those of you who say I was fast,

1963
02:38:51,600 --> 02:38:56,320
give me a thumbs up.

1964
02:38:56,320 --> 02:38:57,800
Let's see, how many do I get?

1965
02:38:57,800 --> 02:39:02,520
I'm expecting only two or three.

1966
02:39:02,520 --> 02:39:04,520
One to

1967
02:39:08,880 --> 02:39:12,320
have a set of two.

1968
02:39:12,320 --> 02:39:14,280
Three or five.

1969
02:39:14,280 --> 02:39:16,760
Okay. I'm sorry.

1970
02:39:17,440 --> 02:39:17,800
Okay.

1971
02:39:17,800 --> 02:39:22,960
Are you all done with the full request?

1972
02:39:22,960 --> 02:39:23,520
Try to.

1973
02:39:23,520 --> 02:39:27,560
The most of anyone was left
with a pool request.

1974
02:39:27,920 --> 02:39:35,280
We will be doing
it more so don't worry. You

1975
02:39:36,760 --> 02:39:40,640
got So we have to just simply merge it.

1976
02:39:40,800 --> 02:39:41,720
It's.

1977
02:39:41,720 --> 02:39:44,680
We will be doing pool request
a lot of times. Don't worry about it.

1978
02:39:44,680 --> 02:39:48,040
If anyone still didn't get the concept
that how it's working,

1979
02:39:48,240 --> 02:39:52,600
I'll make sure that you get in
by the end of you doing a lot of practice.

1980
02:39:52,600 --> 02:39:53,280
Okay.

1981
02:39:53,280 --> 02:39:58,120
Don't worry.

1982
02:39:58,120 --> 02:39:58,720
Okay. Yeah.

1983
02:39:58,720 --> 02:40:03,600
I'll try to work on that door.

1984
02:40:03,600 --> 02:40:07,120
Okay, So now let's go ahead and discuss

1985
02:40:07,120 --> 02:40:11,160
this concept.

1986
02:40:11,160 --> 02:40:14,160
We get a merge on the

1987
02:40:14,240 --> 02:40:18,720
get up right?

1988
02:40:18,720 --> 02:40:21,360
But we are not going to leave it
like that.

1989
02:40:21,360 --> 02:40:23,840
You understand the concept that behind

1990
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,320
which kind of must happen
and how it happened.

1991
02:40:27,320 --> 02:40:29,640
We have to understand

1992
02:40:29,640 --> 02:40:32,040
the first of all,
I want you guys to tell me that

1993
02:40:34,400 --> 02:40:35,880
which my strategy

1994
02:40:35,880 --> 02:40:59,160
is going to be followed.

1995
02:40:59,160 --> 02:41:00,160
Yes. Okay.

1996
02:41:00,160 --> 02:41:02,720
So when I'm merging master,

1997
02:41:02,960 --> 02:41:06,840
the terminology used to come, it's
that it's a little bit different.

1998
02:41:06,840 --> 02:41:09,600
But for now, looking at this diagram,

1999
02:41:09,840 --> 02:41:14,440
I really want you guys to tell
that which strategy will be followed.

2000
02:41:14,520 --> 02:41:16,080
Fast forward like that.

2001
02:41:16,080 --> 02:41:20,080
So it means that the to
something like this is going to happen

2002
02:41:26,320 --> 02:41:31,840
right?

2003
02:41:31,840 --> 02:41:32,520
Right.

2004
02:41:32,800 --> 02:41:36,240
And I want you to tell me this, that if

2005
02:41:39,920 --> 02:41:42,760
there has been another comment, meanwhile.

2006
02:41:44,040 --> 02:41:46,800
Well, I will be able to go to

2007
02:41:48,560 --> 02:41:52,920
using fast much.

2008
02:41:52,920 --> 02:41:55,160
No, I would like to right

2009
02:41:57,480 --> 02:41:58,000
perfect.

2010
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:00,720
I'm really glad
that you guys are understanding fast.

2011
02:42:01,200 --> 02:42:02,880
So good.

2012
02:42:02,880 --> 02:42:06,040
And the last thing about fast Our life
which I want you guys

2013
02:42:06,120 --> 02:42:10,760
to, is that it's going to be a question,

2014
02:42:12,480 --> 02:42:15,320
is there ever going to be a conflict?

2015
02:42:15,560 --> 02:42:21,240
Then you do a fast forward merge.

2016
02:42:21,240 --> 02:42:22,320
Don't answer me.

2017
02:42:22,320 --> 02:42:24,360
Just think of like

2018
02:42:26,880 --> 02:42:29,280
everyone is saying no.

2019
02:42:29,280 --> 02:42:32,320
Is there anyone who thinks that
there need be?

2020
02:42:33,320 --> 02:42:39,440
Is there maybe person?

2021
02:42:39,440 --> 02:42:42,720
I mean, you did that for fun, right?

2022
02:42:42,720 --> 02:42:50,840
And my name you two.

2023
02:42:50,840 --> 02:42:54,200
Okay, so we discussed that

2024
02:42:54,280 --> 02:42:56,120
conflict arises where?

2025
02:42:57,800 --> 02:42:58,320
So the

2026
02:42:58,320 --> 02:43:00,960
question was that will there be conflict

2027
02:43:01,440 --> 02:43:09,360
that our there will be a faster merge.

2028
02:43:09,360 --> 02:43:13,440
Will you have a conflict

2029
02:43:13,560 --> 02:43:21,720
as you did something wrong?

2030
02:43:21,720 --> 02:43:31,080
You cannot have a conflict
if you don't have a conflict.

2031
02:43:31,080 --> 02:43:36,160
If it's a fast forward
much, I'll show you.

2032
02:43:36,160 --> 02:43:38,200
I'll prove it to you. Why?

2033
02:43:38,200 --> 02:43:42,640
Okay, so we discussed that.

2034
02:43:42,640 --> 02:43:45,760
When does a conflict, other conflicts

2035
02:43:45,840 --> 02:43:48,000
occur then

2036
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:51,480
on one line there was something,

2037
02:43:52,120 --> 02:43:56,680
and now on another line
there is something else.

2038
02:43:56,680 --> 02:44:06,160
And get us confused
with line to keep right.

2039
02:44:06,160 --> 02:44:12,240
This is a scenario
and a positive difference, right.

2040
02:44:12,240 --> 02:44:16,120
But we saw that in a fast forward.

2041
02:44:16,760 --> 02:44:20,840
Give us simply, you know,
pointing towards other it is not even,

2042
02:44:21,840 --> 02:44:25,440
you know, merging in actual anything.

2043
02:44:25,600 --> 02:44:27,800
It's not doing an actual merge.

2044
02:44:28,320 --> 02:44:37,200
So what do you guys think
is going to be a conflict?

2045
02:44:37,200 --> 02:44:38,440
No, it will not be.

2046
02:44:38,440 --> 02:44:42,680
So now, I hope that you guys do understand
that no conflicts

2047
02:44:43,440 --> 02:44:48,160
and a fast was simply it's going to start

2048
02:44:48,160 --> 02:44:51,400
pointing towards your final comment
and that's okay.

2049
02:44:52,040 --> 02:44:54,080
So you can see that

2050
02:44:54,680 --> 02:45:00,600
your data is going to be overwritten.

2051
02:45:00,600 --> 02:45:04,400
The data is going to
be overwritten if you change

2052
02:45:05,400 --> 02:45:06,680
if you made some changes

2053
02:45:06,680 --> 02:45:11,880
on the same line.

2054
02:45:11,880 --> 02:45:15,640
So on the same line in The Boss,
we had no one got call us

2055
02:45:17,200 --> 02:45:20,720
and then we merged it out of that
all over again.

2056
02:45:21,360 --> 02:45:21,960
Right?

2057
02:45:22,440 --> 02:45:29,760
This is what happened.

2058
02:45:29,760 --> 02:45:30,040
Okay.

2059
02:45:30,040 --> 02:45:33,720
So when there is no conflict
that's must take place, no harm.

2060
02:45:33,720 --> 02:45:36,080
That's wrong. That's totally wrong.

2061
02:45:36,800 --> 02:45:45,600
Faster modes
takes place in this particular condition.

2062
02:45:45,600 --> 02:45:47,920
The scenario you are saying is different.

2063
02:45:48,280 --> 02:45:52,040
There might be a possibility
that a faster remote is not possible,

2064
02:45:52,600 --> 02:45:55,200
but also there is no conflict.

2065
02:45:55,280 --> 02:45:56,680
There will be having a look at that.

2066
02:45:56,680 --> 02:46:00,240
No word. Okay, guys.

2067
02:46:00,240 --> 02:46:03,600
So I think things are pretty much

2068
02:46:03,600 --> 02:46:07,360
straightforward up till this point
and I think complicated.

2069
02:46:07,360 --> 02:46:10,440
Everything is going smoothly
as far as ideas.

2070
02:46:10,440 --> 02:46:12,720
Now I really want to hear from your side.

2071
02:46:12,720 --> 02:46:16,040
Is that the scenario or I stuck

2072
02:46:16,040 --> 02:46:21,120
in the branches?

2073
02:46:21,120 --> 02:46:23,200
Obviously it's not. That's great.

2074
02:46:24,320 --> 02:46:25,640
When are we supposed to

2075
02:46:25,640 --> 02:46:33,440
have our next quick?

2076
02:46:33,440 --> 02:46:35,840
Is it all in the time

2077
02:46:40,960 --> 02:46:44,920
and really want you to tell me?

2078
02:46:44,920 --> 02:46:48,840
Because after that
you're going to have no break, right?

2079
02:46:48,840 --> 02:46:50,480
And it's going to be class.

2080
02:46:50,480 --> 02:46:53,640
It's going to end at three right?

2081
02:46:53,640 --> 02:46:54,360
30 minutes.

2082
02:46:54,360 --> 02:47:01,480
Rick Seriously, dude, that's
what's up there.

2083
02:47:01,480 --> 02:47:03,200
Okay, so those are just six.

2084
02:47:03,200 --> 02:47:05,640
Let's meet at

2085
02:47:09,800 --> 02:47:11,920
a new light in 20, please.

2086
02:47:11,920 --> 02:47:16,280
Not 30.

2087
02:47:16,280 --> 02:47:18,480
Okay, Let's do it later. This way.

2088
02:47:18,480 --> 02:47:19,040
How about that?

2089
02:47:19,040 --> 02:47:23,200
That's okay.

2090
02:47:23,200 --> 02:47:26,280
I really want to spend a lot of time
giving you a lot of examples.

2091
02:47:26,280 --> 02:47:29,400
That's why
I'm not going to give you, again, give 30,

2092
02:47:29,400 --> 02:47:33,400
but obviously that it will come
at some time out of the examples.

2093
02:47:34,600 --> 02:47:34,960
Yeah.

2094
02:47:34,960 --> 02:47:37,800
So 20, is that right?

2095
02:47:38,560 --> 02:47:39,480
So one

2096
02:47:40,720 --> 02:47:42,800
look it's not going to 120 12.

2097
02:47:42,880 --> 02:47:46,800
116 but yeah,

2098
02:47:46,880 --> 02:47:51,920
it's one 1639 and 116

2099
02:47:54,560 --> 02:47:54,960
All good.

2100
02:47:54,960 --> 02:47:57,680
118 Come on

2101
02:47:59,760 --> 02:48:03,120
break two 118 But

2102
02:48:05,520 --> 02:48:08,320
yes I said sure, why not.

2103
02:48:09,880 --> 02:48:25,880
Tell me what's the problem.

2104
02:48:25,880 --> 02:48:28,920
I think I just learned step. Which one.

2105
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:31,680
Well first of all telling me that

2106
02:48:32,640 --> 02:48:34,680
at which point you left the class

2107
02:48:34,840 --> 02:48:40,920
because then I'll help you.

2108
02:48:40,920 --> 02:48:45,960
You're on the great breaker one. It.

2109
02:48:45,960 --> 02:48:51,280
I did not see my son and above six
but in the local or under law,

2110
02:48:52,080 --> 02:48:56,480
you see them on the local.

2111
02:48:56,480 --> 02:48:59,320
Okay so I said you see your

2112
02:49:02,760 --> 02:49:04,080
boss that

2113
02:49:05,280 --> 02:49:07,640
never sent me this horrible five

2114
02:49:07,680 --> 02:49:09,320
seven screenshot

2115
02:49:21,120 --> 02:49:21,920
you miss Very.

2116
02:49:21,920 --> 02:49:24,880
My son did not fix the lead.

2117
02:49:25,560 --> 02:49:30,560
Okay, so send screenshot of your terminal

2118
02:49:30,560 --> 02:49:33,840
and then I can suggest you some time

2119
02:49:33,840 --> 02:49:51,960
so that you can get caught up.

2120
02:49:51,960 --> 02:49:54,360
I saw this one thing. I seen it.

2121
02:49:54,360 --> 02:49:57,480
This is going to take a lot of time.

2122
02:49:57,480 --> 02:49:58,080
What? Really?

2123
02:49:58,080 --> 02:50:02,280
You have to watch this part of the class
because if you left, there are some

2124
02:50:02,600 --> 02:50:03,720
resources that have to do.

2125
02:50:05,600 --> 02:50:07,960
But the
rest of the steps that will be following,

2126
02:50:07,960 --> 02:50:12,520
they obviously are going to be isolated
from this one and then to building.

2127
02:50:12,520 --> 02:50:14,840
And you can have this good thing

2128
02:50:16,840 --> 02:50:19,320
from there you can proceed.

2129
02:50:19,320 --> 02:50:22,160
So I'll teach you how you do that.

2130
02:50:22,160 --> 02:50:27,600
Open this link,
closed this repository, and

2131
02:50:28,760 --> 02:50:30,800
then I'll tell you what to do next.

2132
02:50:30,800 --> 02:50:33,600
Don't disappear that quickly.

2133
02:50:33,600 --> 02:50:35,040
I know that you

2134
02:50:35,800 --> 02:50:38,400
the next steps on teaching

2135
02:50:49,920 --> 02:51:06,240
so let's not do this

2136
02:51:06,240 --> 02:51:12,040
because a lot of students
will be confused by this.

2137
02:51:12,040 --> 02:51:15,800
I shall just
personally write in the comments that.

2138
02:51:15,840 --> 02:51:17,480
But you need to do

2139
02:51:20,480 --> 02:51:23,000
all the rest of

2140
02:51:24,760 --> 02:51:27,840
to create a new

2141
02:51:28,080 --> 02:51:30,560
who on the top

2142
02:51:32,160 --> 02:51:36,240
for this project me

2143
02:51:39,960 --> 02:51:40,800
remove

2144
02:51:40,800 --> 02:51:54,240
the lecture from you

2145
02:51:55,520 --> 02:51:57,120
look through

2146
02:51:59,840 --> 02:52:02,400
the syntax

2147
02:52:07,800 --> 02:52:10,800
you to your

2148
02:52:12,280 --> 02:52:17,480
new I would

2149
02:52:26,520 --> 02:52:27,600
also you

2150
02:52:27,600 --> 02:52:31,920
need to follow these steps
and they will actually give you

2151
02:52:31,920 --> 02:52:34,680
the same code as I have

2152
02:52:35,280 --> 02:52:37,320
the same permits as I have.

2153
02:52:38,040 --> 02:52:42,800
And it would also make
you push your code to get out of here

2154
02:52:42,800 --> 02:52:46,440
or just make sure that you create
a new requisite three new

2155
02:52:46,480 --> 02:52:51,760
or more preposition and just make sure
that you add this connection to the local.

2156
02:52:52,080 --> 02:52:56,320
Okay,
that's going to work from here onwards.

2157
02:52:56,320 --> 02:53:00,760
You can just, you know, easily follow up.

2158
02:53:00,760 --> 02:53:05,640
Yes, I issues that No, I'll just come back
from the break in five or 10 minutes.

2159
02:53:06,120 --> 03:07:56,400
So I should

2160
03:07:56,520 --> 03:07:59,680
So in step three actually means that

2161
03:08:00,840 --> 03:08:04,440
the client is already connected to

2162
03:08:05,160 --> 03:08:07,440
my GitHub
because you go in my opposite group.

2163
03:08:08,040 --> 03:08:13,000
So you need to remove that connection
and add the connection of that.

2164
03:08:13,000 --> 03:08:24,080
Does that make sense?

2165
03:08:24,080 --> 03:08:31,200
Okay, so this is what you need to do.

2166
03:08:31,200 --> 03:08:33,560
Just like Alex,
you are able to understand me.

2167
03:08:33,560 --> 03:08:35,560
I am unable to extend the person. Mark

2168
03:08:36,640 --> 03:08:39,040
So We
need to be more precise about things.

2169
03:08:39,200 --> 03:08:44,120
Yes, it has to

2170
03:08:46,720 --> 03:08:47,640
what we need to do.

2171
03:08:47,640 --> 03:08:48,840
Nothing else.

2172
03:08:48,840 --> 03:08:49,760
Just Aisha.

2173
03:08:49,760 --> 03:08:53,040
We are on break and I think we are done.

2174
03:08:53,880 --> 03:08:54,760
Okay, perfect.

2175
03:08:54,760 --> 03:08:57,960
That's. That's good.

2176
03:08:57,960 --> 03:09:02,160
Okay, now the next topic
that we are going to dive into is

2177
03:09:03,840 --> 03:09:06,720
going to be

2178
03:09:08,840 --> 03:09:10,000
still the browsers.

2179
03:09:10,000 --> 03:09:12,360
Okay?

2180
03:09:12,360 --> 03:09:16,720
But other examples
and other kind of scenarios that we face,

2181
03:09:16,720 --> 03:09:21,600
we have to discuss them here.

2182
03:09:21,600 --> 03:09:22,200
Okay.

2183
03:09:22,200 --> 03:09:45,280
So let's start from this point.

2184
03:09:45,280 --> 03:09:46,920
Something fucking do today.

2185
03:09:46,920 --> 03:09:49,040
A function is something that

2186
03:09:50,280 --> 03:09:53,240
that I don't teach in the schools.

2187
03:09:53,240 --> 03:09:54,200
Actually

2188
03:10:08,880 --> 03:10:09,800
existing.

2189
03:10:10,600 --> 03:10:13,960
I don't teach stacks

2190
03:10:25,080 --> 03:10:27,520
the well I honestly meant

2191
03:10:27,640 --> 03:10:31,520
that we do not discuss out for free,

2192
03:10:31,920 --> 03:10:35,280
but somehow
it turned into this kind of use.

2193
03:10:35,280 --> 03:10:44,080
So how do you address
one thing for playing?

2194
03:10:44,080 --> 03:10:45,000
I can

2195
03:10:46,040 --> 03:10:48,400
give you an overview about

2196
03:10:48,400 --> 03:10:50,600
that something that most we really don't

2197
03:10:52,000 --> 03:10:54,080
what we need for the project. So

2198
03:10:55,920 --> 03:10:58,400
that's why I just to me

2199
03:10:58,640 --> 03:11:01,400
maybe I'll see if it needs
to be floated out

2200
03:11:02,920 --> 03:11:09,080
Now let's get back to our example

2201
03:11:09,080 --> 03:11:12,040
that we were running
and let's try to complete that.

2202
03:11:13,480 --> 03:11:15,880
So a lot of practice, a lot of practice

2203
03:11:16,120 --> 03:11:19,440
practice.

2204
03:11:19,440 --> 03:11:20,640
Let's do one thing now.

2205
03:11:20,640 --> 03:11:23,880
Let's switch to our

2206
03:11:27,440 --> 03:11:27,880
master.

2207
03:11:27,880 --> 03:11:28,840
Let's

2208
03:11:29,840 --> 03:11:31,440
start with me.

2209
03:11:32,160 --> 03:11:35,480
Okay, So now I am in Main branch.

2210
03:11:36,960 --> 03:11:39,840
If I up my intelligent

2211
03:11:39,840 --> 03:11:46,200
device, see this much updated.

2212
03:11:46,200 --> 03:11:51,760
Sorry.

2213
03:11:51,760 --> 03:11:55,000
Like is it updated with the remote

2214
03:11:55,000 --> 03:12:08,040
repository?

2215
03:12:08,040 --> 03:12:11,160
Is this much updated with that
in what not?

2216
03:12:11,160 --> 03:12:16,520
It's not in order to make sure that
what we need to do is get this command

2217
03:12:18,000 --> 03:12:19,200
is therefore

2218
03:12:19,200 --> 03:12:22,360
making sure that it's updated,
are not updated

2219
03:12:22,360 --> 03:12:23,200
or not

2220
03:12:31,320 --> 03:12:32,280
with command.

2221
03:12:32,280 --> 03:12:37,880
We use to see that our local wrap
as it is updated with the remote

2222
03:12:39,280 --> 03:12:41,320
is sent with the remote.

2223
03:12:41,320 --> 03:12:45,160
The command for that
that law and one other command

2224
03:12:45,160 --> 03:12:48,160
that I taught you is get set.

2225
03:12:48,160 --> 03:12:53,280
And what I see, no, no way.

2226
03:12:53,280 --> 03:12:56,400
Get facts right, never get fresh

2227
03:12:56,440 --> 03:13:02,360
tells us if there is any updated
that needs to be pulled.

2228
03:13:02,360 --> 03:13:05,960
So yeah,
I see that my new branch has some updates

2229
03:13:05,960 --> 03:13:10,200
which I do not have locally.

2230
03:13:10,200 --> 03:13:12,720
If I didn't get law

2231
03:13:13,760 --> 03:13:17,320
at this point
I just see two commits and nothing else.

2232
03:13:17,320 --> 03:13:23,160
So it's not giving me sufficient
information right?

2233
03:13:23,160 --> 03:13:27,200
It's not giving sufficient information.

2234
03:13:27,200 --> 03:13:31,080
So the correct amount
that you should always use

2235
03:13:31,640 --> 03:13:34,960
when you are checking that
if there is an update in

2236
03:13:34,960 --> 03:13:42,600
the remote repository is get fetch.

2237
03:13:42,600 --> 03:13:44,480
What happened to get such

2238
03:13:46,720 --> 03:13:52,800
system?

2239
03:13:52,800 --> 03:13:55,080
Now it's not working.

2240
03:13:56,880 --> 03:14:15,480
What have.

2241
03:14:15,480 --> 03:14:17,960
Yeah,
I think that is something new for me too

2242
03:14:18,720 --> 03:14:21,360
because I never did that check it twice

2243
03:14:23,000 --> 03:14:24,240
so. Well.

2244
03:14:24,920 --> 03:14:25,520
Okay. Yeah.

2245
03:14:25,520 --> 03:14:31,480
So that means that once
we have checked with that, if you do that

2246
03:14:31,480 --> 03:14:34,960
again, it's not going to get us app
because it showed us the output

2247
03:14:34,960 --> 03:14:39,840
following.

2248
03:14:39,840 --> 03:14:42,760
That's that's a problem. Yes.

2249
03:14:42,760 --> 03:14:44,320
Yeah. Okay.

2250
03:14:44,320 --> 03:14:49,080
Tell you that that's surprising
because I honestly after having every time

2251
03:14:49,280 --> 03:14:52,640
that if there was an update
I immediately did the pool

2252
03:14:53,400 --> 03:14:57,560
so what are you do that
if there is adopted just the pool okay

2253
03:14:59,360 --> 03:15:12,000
is that you do
I want how to confirm that login is done

2254
03:15:12,680 --> 03:15:19,200
then to check that on GitHub.

2255
03:15:19,200 --> 03:15:22,400
On GitHub receipt from your main branch
you have the final commit

2256
03:15:22,400 --> 03:15:24,880
that issue in the future
sun has been resolved.

2257
03:15:25,560 --> 03:15:26,640
So it's been

2258
03:15:27,720 --> 03:15:28,440
okay.

2259
03:15:29,040 --> 03:15:32,200
And so it shows you that multiple requests
from some fixed

2260
03:15:32,200 --> 03:15:36,360
technologies, it's done.

2261
03:15:36,360 --> 03:15:38,920
You can go ahead and see the cool lot.

2262
03:15:38,920 --> 03:15:40,920
So it would show you

2263
03:15:41,800 --> 03:15:46,720
that merge is zero.

2264
03:15:46,720 --> 03:15:47,200
Oh you guys.

2265
03:15:47,200 --> 03:15:48,360
So now what we are going to do,

2266
03:15:48,360 --> 03:15:50,640
we are going to update
our local repository

2267
03:15:51,360 --> 03:15:53,880
folder anymore and for that simply

2268
03:15:53,880 --> 03:15:58,560
get cool.

2269
03:15:58,560 --> 03:16:16,840
Okay.

2270
03:16:16,840 --> 03:16:22,280
So you need to do this.

2271
03:16:22,280 --> 03:16:22,800
Okay guys.

2272
03:16:22,800 --> 03:16:26,960
So now after the cool, everything is there

2273
03:16:27,560 --> 03:16:29,160
and my

2274
03:16:30,080 --> 03:16:31,920
project is update.

2275
03:16:31,920 --> 03:16:36,240
Let me know if you guys are still
this client synchronized with me

2276
03:16:36,240 --> 03:16:38,920
and then we can proceed to further

2277
03:16:42,400 --> 03:16:42,800
plugins.

2278
03:16:42,800 --> 03:16:45,320
So let's have a quick look at our logs

2279
03:16:47,880 --> 03:16:49,360
and get them all

2280
03:16:50,120 --> 03:16:52,680
because frankly we have two branches

2281
03:16:55,960 --> 03:17:00,000
and let me see
the command that we have for

2282
03:17:02,000 --> 03:17:03,920
the Okay, so this

2283
03:17:03,920 --> 03:17:07,680
command is going to help us
look at the branches

2284
03:17:07,680 --> 03:17:15,920
in a more defined.

2285
03:17:15,920 --> 03:17:16,280
Okay.

2286
03:17:16,320 --> 03:17:19,920
So I'm going to copy this and duty guys to

2287
03:17:20,600 --> 03:17:24,440
plus $5 because I spend

2288
03:17:26,040 --> 03:17:28,920
a lot of time searching for this one

2289
03:17:28,920 --> 03:17:31,200
so you can see those dollars.

2290
03:17:31,200 --> 03:17:36,280
By the same token.

2291
03:17:36,280 --> 03:17:40,320
But this would show you
the basic structure

2292
03:17:44,760 --> 03:17:49,440
of this.

2293
03:17:49,440 --> 03:17:52,640
You can do stuff like that that would
that would be helpful.

2294
03:17:53,400 --> 03:17:57,120
But just give that's one does Yeah.

2295
03:17:57,120 --> 03:18:00,240
Okay. So this

2296
03:18:00,240 --> 03:18:05,400
particular command is going to make it
a little bit better, but still, it's

2297
03:18:05,400 --> 03:18:09,560
a little bit complicated to understand
the processor of and proceed.

2298
03:18:10,200 --> 03:18:14,760
But as you proceed, I would try to make it
more clear how to study this.

2299
03:18:15,120 --> 03:18:16,560
We will have a look at that.

2300
03:18:16,560 --> 03:18:18,480
But for now, this copy does

2301
03:18:18,480 --> 03:18:22,280
come out of activity in your computer
and we will be learning it as we

2302
03:18:23,520 --> 03:18:24,520
move on to the next month.

2303
03:18:24,520 --> 03:18:26,680
Just oh,

2304
03:18:28,520 --> 03:18:31,920
I'll I'll teach you how to read it.

2305
03:18:32,880 --> 03:18:33,280
Okay.

2306
03:18:33,280 --> 03:18:38,520
So the next and the final example
we have is going to be pretty big.

2307
03:18:38,520 --> 03:18:43,160
One will try to complete it today,
but mostly be I think we won't be able to.

2308
03:18:43,920 --> 03:18:54,720
But still, let's start up today.

2309
03:18:54,720 --> 03:18:55,680
Okay, guys.

2310
03:18:55,680 --> 03:19:01,680
So scenario

2311
03:19:04,880 --> 03:19:06,920
on the project.

2312
03:19:07,560 --> 03:19:09,600
So we're system

2313
03:19:11,320 --> 03:19:13,320
two new

2314
03:19:13,800 --> 03:19:15,040
people

2315
03:19:16,360 --> 03:19:19,440
were hired.

2316
03:19:19,440 --> 03:19:22,920
So there are two new people
who are hired on this project

2317
03:19:22,920 --> 03:19:28,320
and they were asked to do
some contributions on this.

2318
03:19:28,360 --> 03:19:31,160
You know, this was a very big project.

2319
03:19:31,560 --> 03:19:33,880
It's not a system like system.

2320
03:19:33,880 --> 03:19:39,720
So we need two new people in our team.

2321
03:19:39,720 --> 03:19:43,160
Let's have some good names for that

2322
03:19:43,440 --> 03:19:44,040
monkey.

2323
03:19:44,040 --> 03:19:45,400
And then

2324
03:19:46,200 --> 03:19:48,080
it's not that one. It's not a

2325
03:19:50,480 --> 03:19:54,000
function that you are living, right.

2326
03:19:54,000 --> 03:19:57,440
Bob and Jim are to argue that he's good.

2327
03:19:58,680 --> 03:20:01,200
Okay, so you don't want to do that too.

2328
03:20:01,800 --> 03:20:05,640
I hate that.

2329
03:20:05,640 --> 03:20:10,280
By the way, pretending to be both of them
funky and groups.

2330
03:20:11,200 --> 03:20:13,720
So funky is here

2331
03:20:13,720 --> 03:20:23,360
and is donkey.

2332
03:20:23,360 --> 03:20:23,800
Okay.

2333
03:20:23,800 --> 03:20:27,120
Now I will recommend that
you guys follow me to

2334
03:20:31,480 --> 03:20:34,760
because last time you did that example,

2335
03:20:36,280 --> 03:20:38,880
now you should be able to put ten

2336
03:20:40,640 --> 03:20:42,720
being, you know, to use that
it's going to be half

2337
03:20:44,840 --> 03:20:46,640
if you want to be like

2338
03:20:46,640 --> 03:20:50,560
this one at no problems like it.

2339
03:20:50,560 --> 03:20:56,960
My main one is donkey with the other.

2340
03:20:56,960 --> 03:21:04,600
It's not that one.

2341
03:21:04,600 --> 03:21:09,000
Oh, let's remember his name too,
you know, funky

2342
03:21:09,000 --> 03:21:17,280
and so funky.

2343
03:21:17,280 --> 03:21:19,840
Funky and yeah.

2344
03:21:19,920 --> 03:21:21,080
Okay. So we name the

2345
03:21:22,080 --> 03:21:22,880
change, the name

2346
03:21:22,880 --> 03:21:26,880
for Donkey to Chunky.

2347
03:21:26,880 --> 03:21:29,040
It was rhyming, but

2348
03:21:30,000 --> 03:21:31,000
he more than come back

2349
03:21:31,000 --> 03:21:34,120
Yeah that that sounds in that

2350
03:21:37,800 --> 03:21:39,000
okay you guys now a Google

2351
03:21:39,000 --> 03:21:43,440
do simply open up this guy and get Bashir

2352
03:21:44,520 --> 03:21:47,800
and clone the project for both of them.

2353
03:21:47,800 --> 03:21:52,680
So this these steps
are not going to be slow because I expect

2354
03:21:52,680 --> 03:21:57,080
you guys
to be very quick in these things get

2355
03:21:57,520 --> 03:21:59,920
and we have done it a lot of times

2356
03:22:00,840 --> 03:22:04,400
just simply cloning repositories
being the user

2357
03:22:04,880 --> 03:22:09,440
funky and junky.

2358
03:22:09,440 --> 03:22:12,840
So I have done it for funky now

2359
03:22:12,840 --> 03:22:17,280
I'll do it for something.

2360
03:22:17,280 --> 03:22:20,240
I want you guys to follow a bit.

2361
03:22:20,880 --> 03:22:23,520
These guys have to plug

2362
03:22:44,640 --> 03:22:56,120
it back to it now.

2363
03:22:56,120 --> 03:23:01,160
So now both of them are having the project
on their system, right?

2364
03:23:02,040 --> 03:23:11,720
The Doors have a project.

2365
03:23:11,720 --> 03:23:23,600
This one is for funky
and this one is for our friend Sheldon.

2366
03:23:23,600 --> 03:23:34,600
Okay,
let me know once all of you are done.

2367
03:23:34,600 --> 03:23:34,960
Okay,

2368
03:23:39,800 --> 03:23:41,120
so now the

2369
03:23:41,120 --> 03:23:43,800
tasks have been assigned by the team

2370
03:23:44,160 --> 03:23:47,880
to both of them to funky

2371
03:23:47,920 --> 03:23:50,160
work on Planet One

2372
03:23:55,880 --> 03:24:01,320
and for charity work on Future Planet.

2373
03:24:01,440 --> 03:24:05,440
You know, like there are two planets
in the solar system, right?

2374
03:24:06,160 --> 03:24:08,360
And like, they are a huge planet.

2375
03:24:08,360 --> 03:24:10,560
There are a lot of code
that have to be written.

2376
03:24:10,560 --> 03:24:14,080
So these two people were given
the responsibility to work in parallel

2377
03:24:15,920 --> 03:24:18,720
so that the project
can be completed in time

2378
03:24:19,600 --> 03:24:23,760
so the books will close the project
and start working in parallel

2379
03:24:23,800 --> 03:24:27,800
on the planets.

2380
03:24:27,800 --> 03:24:31,240
But obviously I cannot show you
the parallel stuff

2381
03:24:31,440 --> 03:24:33,920
and I'll just had one by one

2382
03:24:35,160 --> 03:24:36,640
we working on those projects.

2383
03:24:36,640 --> 03:24:38,760
So let's go ahead and first

2384
03:24:39,840 --> 03:24:42,680
work on the project of Funky

2385
03:24:45,360 --> 03:24:46,080
That's funky,

2386
03:24:47,160 --> 03:24:48,320
the output of the

2387
03:24:48,320 --> 03:24:59,520
project, new project,
and then I clone it, no file.

2388
03:25:00,200 --> 03:25:04,680
So it's going to be for me on desktop.

2389
03:25:04,720 --> 03:25:10,200
So documents, desktop and

2390
03:25:12,400 --> 03:25:14,440
I that's

2391
03:25:14,440 --> 03:25:19,160
the last system.

2392
03:25:19,160 --> 03:25:26,440
New will.

2393
03:25:26,440 --> 03:25:29,120
Okay, So there I go.

2394
03:25:29,160 --> 03:25:30,000
I have

2395
03:25:32,680 --> 03:25:35,120
this project is how to do it from

2396
03:25:41,600 --> 03:25:46,120
well well maybe configuration file

2397
03:25:49,080 --> 03:25:51,080
yes well but

2398
03:25:51,440 --> 03:25:54,920
we are not interested in that but now

2399
03:25:55,960 --> 03:25:56,920
that's fine.

2400
03:25:57,680 --> 03:25:59,880
We discussed that
we are not focusing on code.

2401
03:26:00,720 --> 03:26:03,360
The code is zero, which was in the

2402
03:26:08,400 --> 03:26:09,080
on the GitHub.

2403
03:26:09,080 --> 03:26:13,680
It's here
and we are good enough with that.

2404
03:26:13,680 --> 03:26:14,280
Okay,

2405
03:26:16,200 --> 03:26:19,200
let's open up our

2406
03:26:20,880 --> 03:26:23,120
terminal for

2407
03:26:24,240 --> 03:26:26,440
so I need to do else

2408
03:26:26,640 --> 03:26:29,960
it's solar system outside see solar system

2409
03:26:30,320 --> 03:26:35,640
I'll go into this particular folder
and then I'll see

2410
03:26:36,840 --> 03:26:40,000
get status

2411
03:26:41,960 --> 03:26:43,560
if you create the new project

2412
03:26:43,560 --> 03:26:46,400
or just open that will one person.

2413
03:26:47,440 --> 03:26:50,560
I did not create any project, nor did

2414
03:26:50,560 --> 03:26:54,160
I open the old instead I wonder approve.

2415
03:26:54,400 --> 03:26:59,320
And that opened up to project
which I just closed.

2416
03:26:59,800 --> 03:27:02,720
Okay, so for everyone is that clear?

2417
03:27:03,920 --> 03:27:07,200
That item will clean up the project
which at launch

2418
03:27:07,760 --> 03:27:10,200
we have done this on

2419
03:27:10,720 --> 03:27:14,400
in the last class.

2420
03:27:14,400 --> 03:27:22,680
How I created the launch.

2421
03:27:22,680 --> 03:27:25,320
This one right here

2422
03:27:35,040 --> 03:27:37,320
on the storage of the address of system.

2423
03:27:37,800 --> 03:27:39,520
Are you all

2424
03:27:41,600 --> 03:27:49,200
with me?

2425
03:27:49,200 --> 03:27:49,560
Yeah.

2426
03:27:49,560 --> 03:27:53,160
I'm also getting an error because
the configuration files are missing.

2427
03:27:53,160 --> 03:27:56,480
We have add some population files
and it no disappear.

2428
03:27:56,480 --> 03:28:02,440
But as I mentioned
that, just forget it for now, okay?

2429
03:28:02,440 --> 03:28:04,200
We do not have to issue on this for

2430
03:28:14,400 --> 03:28:15,640
add this in the get

2431
03:28:15,640 --> 03:28:20,360
ignore file.

2432
03:28:20,360 --> 03:28:20,880
Yeah.

2433
03:28:20,880 --> 03:28:24,440
This does underscore stories
for the Mac users.

2434
03:28:24,440 --> 03:28:26,520
It's just a simple file that gets created.

2435
03:28:26,520 --> 03:28:28,960
It's very quickly just

2436
03:28:28,960 --> 03:28:31,640
I wouldn't get ignored this
if that's the problem

2437
03:28:31,640 --> 03:28:34,680
for you see you can also

2438
03:28:34,680 --> 03:28:36,560
send it along with the comments.

2439
03:28:36,560 --> 03:28:38,240
That doesn't matter.

2440
03:28:38,240 --> 03:28:38,720
Okay guys.

2441
03:28:38,720 --> 03:28:40,120
So I need to repeat this.

2442
03:28:40,120 --> 03:28:43,040
Everyone, to this point with me,
do you all understand that

2443
03:28:43,080 --> 03:28:46,080
what we are doing,
we are pretending to be one of the user

2444
03:28:46,600 --> 03:28:52,000
who is working on the project
and he is supposed to work on planet One.

2445
03:28:52,640 --> 03:28:57,720
Okay, so for that purpose,
I closed the project off supporting.

2446
03:28:57,720 --> 03:29:00,240
I open up that project in my ontology.

2447
03:29:00,240 --> 03:29:07,800
I am assuming that it should not be a hot
task for you.

2448
03:29:07,800 --> 03:29:12,800
Okay, everyone synchronize,

2449
03:29:12,800 --> 03:29:16,960
read.

2450
03:29:16,960 --> 03:29:22,480
Yeah.

2451
03:29:22,480 --> 03:29:22,840
Okay.

2452
03:29:22,840 --> 03:29:26,960
Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to

2453
03:29:35,360 --> 03:29:35,840
show you

2454
03:29:35,840 --> 03:29:42,760
guys some.

2455
03:29:42,760 --> 03:29:45,240
Yeah. On this much.

2456
03:29:46,400 --> 03:29:48,360
So open up the terminal associated

2457
03:29:48,360 --> 03:29:51,280
with this user

2458
03:29:57,600 --> 03:29:58,200
right now

2459
03:29:58,200 --> 03:30:04,720
in front of me.

2460
03:30:04,720 --> 03:30:05,480
Right.

2461
03:30:05,520 --> 03:30:07,800
Which I'm

2462
03:30:09,760 --> 03:30:11,720
getting much less.

2463
03:30:11,720 --> 03:30:13,320
But now

2464
03:30:13,680 --> 03:30:16,040
we are on the main ones.

2465
03:30:16,040 --> 03:30:19,000
And have you guys noticed else

2466
03:30:21,520 --> 03:30:24,440
you already have

2467
03:30:24,440 --> 03:30:29,280
Main branch.

2468
03:30:29,280 --> 03:30:32,360
There are no other branches

2469
03:30:32,440 --> 03:30:34,800
but that the scenario

2470
03:30:35,840 --> 03:30:40,960
on the GitHub.

2471
03:30:40,960 --> 03:30:44,240
I want you guys to pay attention to this
because this is something you will have

2472
03:30:44,880 --> 03:30:48,240
problems
when you will be working in the projects.

2473
03:30:48,240 --> 03:30:51,040
Okay. Okay.

2474
03:30:51,040 --> 03:30:53,800
So by default what I fully clone

2475
03:30:57,640 --> 03:30:58,800
by default,

2476
03:30:58,800 --> 03:31:00,920
do you only get the main branch

2477
03:31:05,080 --> 03:31:09,000
in order to get other branches

2478
03:31:10,120 --> 03:31:14,200
on your system?

2479
03:31:14,200 --> 03:31:18,000
You have to follow procedure.

2480
03:31:19,240 --> 03:31:21,520
And what's that procedure?

2481
03:31:21,520 --> 03:31:25,960
We will discuss shortly.

2482
03:31:25,960 --> 03:31:28,760
It's really simple.

2483
03:31:28,760 --> 03:31:30,360
Well, it's not complicated.

2484
03:31:30,360 --> 03:31:31,800
It's simple because

2485
03:31:33,120 --> 03:31:35,520
there is a possibility that

2486
03:31:35,520 --> 03:31:37,920
the user one, which I am right

2487
03:31:37,920 --> 03:31:42,800
now, I want to work on planet.

2488
03:31:42,800 --> 03:31:44,400
What do I need other branches?

2489
03:31:44,400 --> 03:31:47,760
Do I need some?

2490
03:31:47,760 --> 03:31:48,920
No, I don't need that.

2491
03:31:48,920 --> 03:31:51,400
So if get

2492
03:31:51,400 --> 03:31:54,080
closed,
all those glasses belong redundant.

2493
03:31:54,080 --> 03:31:55,200
So it is very smart.

2494
03:31:55,200 --> 03:32:00,680
Okay, so don't say that they are making it
complicated if you want to have it.

2495
03:32:00,680 --> 03:32:02,880
It's really simple.

2496
03:32:03,400 --> 03:32:05,920
Okay So right now

2497
03:32:05,920 --> 03:32:10,640
we only have main branch
and we are aligning that.

2498
03:32:10,640 --> 03:32:13,640
Okay, now tell me that should I start

2499
03:32:13,640 --> 03:32:17,400
working on Main Branch
or should I create a new branch

2500
03:32:17,440 --> 03:32:24,960
if I want to work on particular,
I want to create a new branch.

2501
03:32:24,960 --> 03:32:27,760
So I would say get branch

2502
03:32:29,600 --> 03:32:32,040
planet one

2503
03:32:32,040 --> 03:32:37,680
and then I need to push to.

2504
03:32:37,680 --> 03:32:37,960
Okay,

2505
03:32:39,760 --> 03:32:41,120
so I have

2506
03:32:41,120 --> 03:32:44,840
successfully split two planet for all of

2507
03:32:46,080 --> 03:32:48,120
switch to planet one after creating it.

2508
03:32:48,120 --> 03:32:49,480
And let me

2509
03:33:06,680 --> 03:33:09,280
draw some relation
for this particular example.

2510
03:33:09,280 --> 03:33:12,920
Also, we have all the commits the account

2511
03:33:17,320 --> 03:33:20,000
and I'm expecting a final commit.

2512
03:33:20,000 --> 03:33:47,640
Also, we're here for Branch.

2513
03:33:47,640 --> 03:33:55,640
Okay.

2514
03:33:55,640 --> 03:33:57,840
Navigate in the branch.

2515
03:33:57,840 --> 03:34:01,200
It is going to appear out of
in parallel of

2516
03:34:02,760 --> 03:34:03,400
this thing.

2517
03:34:03,400 --> 03:34:05,440
Merge. Right.

2518
03:34:05,600 --> 03:34:07,680
So let's do a branch

2519
03:34:08,960 --> 03:34:09,800
error.

2520
03:34:10,200 --> 03:34:12,000
Unless they make

2521
03:34:19,800 --> 03:34:21,680
planet one

2522
03:34:22,680 --> 03:34:25,840
obvious
something, let's go to our ontology

2523
03:34:26,320 --> 03:34:29,440
and make sure that you of the correct

2524
03:34:29,440 --> 03:34:31,800
users

2525
03:34:32,360 --> 03:34:34,800
project were not working
on a previous branch.

2526
03:34:34,880 --> 03:34:37,000
Make sure of that.
So how do you make sure of that?

2527
03:34:37,000 --> 03:34:38,160
By reading the links.

2528
03:34:38,160 --> 03:34:41,280
I'm in funky sort of system,
so I'm sure about it.

2529
03:34:42,520 --> 03:34:44,160
I need to work on planet one.

2530
03:34:44,160 --> 03:34:47,400
So simply New Java class and throughout it

2531
03:34:50,480 --> 03:34:51,760
I'll explain

2532
03:34:51,760 --> 03:35:00,440
it why?

2533
03:35:00,440 --> 03:35:03,600
So our planet has

2534
03:35:07,040 --> 03:35:09,120
most of the Epsilon

2535
03:35:11,080 --> 03:35:13,560
Spring color

2536
03:35:14,760 --> 03:35:18,640
and its best friend

2537
03:35:18,640 --> 03:35:20,760
status, so it has two properties

2538
03:35:20,760 --> 03:35:31,040
color and science.

2539
03:35:31,040 --> 03:35:38,880
Now I'm going to, in my main class,

2540
03:35:38,880 --> 03:35:39,400
looking

2541
03:35:42,000 --> 03:35:49,640
at these properties, but

2542
03:35:59,560 --> 03:36:03,000
what should be the name of Planet One

2543
03:36:17,040 --> 03:36:17,880
that's

2544
03:36:19,440 --> 03:36:20,360
always

2545
03:36:25,160 --> 03:36:25,720
that?

2546
03:36:26,520 --> 03:36:29,360
I don't know what it means,
but I hope that nothing that

2547
03:36:34,440 --> 03:36:35,240
let's make it

2548
03:36:35,240 --> 03:36:44,680
green, let's

2549
03:36:45,000 --> 03:36:53,360
get some science.

2550
03:36:53,360 --> 03:36:54,600
Okay,

2551
03:36:55,960 --> 03:36:59,040
So let me know when you guys have added

2552
03:36:59,040 --> 03:37:02,080
this class and added this features

2553
03:37:02,080 --> 03:37:04,560
in your main

2554
03:37:06,280 --> 03:37:06,800
engine,

2555
03:37:06,800 --> 03:37:20,720
you are faster than me.

2556
03:37:20,720 --> 03:37:24,240
Okay, So now

2557
03:37:24,240 --> 03:37:26,800
let's go to.

2558
03:37:26,800 --> 03:37:30,520
Okay, so it's not a male, right?

2559
03:37:30,600 --> 03:37:33,320
Nahuatl.

2560
03:37:33,320 --> 03:37:36,320
Oh, let's go to our

2561
03:37:36,320 --> 03:37:37,440
terminal

2562
03:37:39,840 --> 03:37:43,120
and make sure that on the right terminal
it runs to funky.

2563
03:37:43,120 --> 03:37:46,960
Saw our system.

2564
03:37:46,960 --> 03:37:47,400
Okay,

2565
03:37:49,080 --> 03:37:51,080
now what we want

2566
03:37:51,080 --> 03:37:54,560
to do,
we want to make up commit of our code.

2567
03:37:54,840 --> 03:37:57,240
At this point.

2568
03:37:57,240 --> 03:37:59,400
So get at dot

2569
03:38:01,160 --> 03:38:02,600
and get

2570
03:38:02,960 --> 03:38:05,640
it graduate and

2571
03:38:06,280 --> 03:38:08,520
the features of Planet

2572
03:38:08,760 --> 03:38:12,080
One have been added

2573
03:38:12,600 --> 03:38:20,120
successfully.

2574
03:38:20,120 --> 03:38:24,440
Okay, so the current has the name,
so all of you make the commit.

2575
03:38:24,640 --> 03:38:25,760
Now let no.

2576
03:38:25,760 --> 03:38:28,760
So that I will draw this command

2577
03:38:28,960 --> 03:38:31,120
in my diablo

2578
03:38:53,520 --> 03:38:54,240
version

2579
03:38:54,240 --> 03:38:57,280
somehow simply get that data
become adaption.

2580
03:38:57,280 --> 03:38:59,880
Nothing, nothing works and

2581
03:39:01,400 --> 03:39:03,840
then you go last will simply add

2582
03:39:03,840 --> 03:39:15,520
the correct size.

2583
03:39:15,520 --> 03:39:16,240
Okay,

2584
03:39:17,280 --> 03:39:19,440
so now let's run that command

2585
03:39:19,760 --> 03:39:22,800
which we learn for

2586
03:39:24,120 --> 03:39:26,520
the graphing device.

2587
03:39:26,520 --> 03:39:29,600
This is the command
because I don't have this letter

2588
03:39:31,280 --> 03:39:34,320
that that big graph one

2589
03:39:36,680 --> 03:39:39,960
plug space to connect from

2590
03:39:40,600 --> 03:39:47,840
our system.

2591
03:39:47,840 --> 03:39:50,960
Maybe I'll be going

2592
03:39:50,960 --> 03:39:53,080
here from Quito Central

2593
03:39:55,160 --> 03:40:01,960
having an

2594
03:40:17,600 --> 03:40:18,400
Excel.

2595
03:40:18,400 --> 03:40:22,000
Let's try to understand our level of

2596
03:40:27,360 --> 03:40:30,200
so this is the point

2597
03:40:31,440 --> 03:40:34,560
where we extracted a bunch, right?

2598
03:40:35,000 --> 03:40:37,800
So this is going to always

2599
03:40:38,440 --> 03:40:42,080
this particular straight line
is presenting one single

2600
03:40:42,120 --> 03:40:45,320
branch.

2601
03:40:45,320 --> 03:40:48,360
It's not going to look always
from the start like that.

2602
03:40:48,400 --> 03:40:51,960
We are looking upon it
because now after, you know,

2603
03:40:52,800 --> 03:40:55,240
merging that we are visualizing it.

2604
03:40:55,800 --> 03:40:58,320
So that's
why it's appearing like this. And

2605
03:40:59,320 --> 03:41:02,680
it's it will be more effective

2606
03:41:02,680 --> 03:41:07,320
if we saw it from the,
you know, style, Right.

2607
03:41:07,320 --> 03:41:09,360
Know what we did or style.

2608
03:41:09,360 --> 03:41:13,480
This represents one branch
and this title presents, another branch.

2609
03:41:13,480 --> 03:41:17,440
So this is what is happening right?

2610
03:41:17,440 --> 03:41:21,240
We created two different branches

2611
03:41:21,480 --> 03:41:24,480
and we created this graph from

2612
03:41:25,800 --> 03:41:30,040
we have created this blend,
one word from this particular commit.

2613
03:41:30,040 --> 03:41:33,280
So that's why it started
with appearing above

2614
03:41:33,280 --> 03:41:39,320
this.

2615
03:41:39,320 --> 03:41:44,120
Okay, so that's how you actually know,
we tried to read this.

2616
03:41:44,120 --> 03:41:49,760
It's now as you move forward and show you
that how we can, you know, make it

2617
03:41:51,000 --> 03:41:52,320
better, this understanding.

2618
03:41:52,320 --> 03:41:54,240
But it's still complicated.

2619
03:41:54,240 --> 03:41:58,760
But looking for that one line,
I'm never able to find

2620
03:41:58,800 --> 03:42:02,400
a good representation

2621
03:42:02,680 --> 03:42:07,240
of this particular branch and stuff.

2622
03:42:07,240 --> 03:42:10,840
No, I don't like this one too

2623
03:42:14,280 --> 03:42:14,920
obvious.

2624
03:42:14,920 --> 03:42:18,360
Know that's the best of

2625
03:42:18,360 --> 03:42:18,880
the blank.

2626
03:42:18,880 --> 03:42:20,440
One is ready.

2627
03:42:20,440 --> 03:42:23,400
It's done.

2628
03:42:23,400 --> 03:42:29,440
We have successfully added it to the one.

2629
03:42:30,960 --> 03:42:32,320
So now what do I suggest?

2630
03:42:32,320 --> 03:42:34,960
What should I as being the user?

2631
03:42:34,960 --> 03:42:36,440
I have completed it.

2632
03:42:36,440 --> 03:42:48,040
What should be my next step?

2633
03:42:48,040 --> 03:42:52,000
Okay, so I'm preparing to be user one,
which is funky.

2634
03:42:52,320 --> 03:42:57,240
So what is funky supposed to do once
he has completed his teacher?

2635
03:42:57,600 --> 03:43:00,400
Tell me step by step
what should be left first step?

2636
03:43:01,600 --> 03:43:04,880
What should be my first step?

2637
03:43:04,880 --> 03:43:06,040
How can I open up?

2638
03:43:06,040 --> 03:43:07,360
Cool.

2639
03:43:07,360 --> 03:43:08,800
Right now

2640
03:43:10,200 --> 03:43:12,240
I'm repeating now my first step

2641
03:43:14,040 --> 03:43:14,440
after

2642
03:43:14,440 --> 03:43:22,080
completing it.

2643
03:43:22,080 --> 03:43:22,680
Exactly.

2644
03:43:22,680 --> 03:43:26,120
And I'm doing this on purpose because

2645
03:43:26,120 --> 03:43:28,160
I don't want asked to be,

2646
03:43:28,160 --> 03:43:31,120
you know, missing something
and what you are a project.

2647
03:43:31,320 --> 03:43:35,080
So this is your practice because soon
you will do that end of the project.

2648
03:43:35,080 --> 03:43:37,600
This is your practice, not

2649
03:43:39,320 --> 03:43:41,000
okay. So

2650
03:43:41,280 --> 03:43:44,080
let's come out and get personal,
get pushed back to Origin

2651
03:43:44,520 --> 03:44:00,520
Planet one.

2652
03:44:00,520 --> 03:44:02,000
So what?

2653
03:44:02,000 --> 03:44:05,520
You are not entering the correct name.

2654
03:44:05,640 --> 03:44:09,920
Maybe the piece Capital.

2655
03:44:09,920 --> 03:44:10,640
Okay, guys.

2656
03:44:10,640 --> 03:44:13,800
So if I show you at my project,

2657
03:44:14,360 --> 03:44:18,720
the grads have successfully been pushed
and see a planet

2658
03:44:18,720 --> 03:44:25,000
one here.

2659
03:44:25,000 --> 03:44:27,120
Okay, so

2660
03:44:27,240 --> 03:44:29,640
let's leave it for now.

2661
03:44:29,640 --> 03:44:35,280
And meanwhile let's pretend to be chunky
at work kind of crunch.

2662
03:44:35,400 --> 03:44:38,280
So I'm going to close this

2663
03:44:38,440 --> 03:44:40,200
code for funky.

2664
03:44:40,200 --> 03:44:42,920
Where is it?

2665
03:44:42,920 --> 03:44:44,960
This one right to minimize it.

2666
03:44:44,960 --> 03:44:47,240
And I'll start working as a chunky.

2667
03:44:47,880 --> 03:44:50,280
So I guess with me till this point

2668
03:44:52,640 --> 03:44:53,120
we have

2669
03:44:53,120 --> 03:44:56,040
uploaded
the branch pretending to be you one.

2670
03:44:56,520 --> 03:44:59,560
Now we would be pretending to be the two
and start

2671
03:44:59,560 --> 03:45:03,440
working on.

2672
03:45:03,440 --> 03:45:05,760
So simply open up your intelligence

2673
03:45:06,720 --> 03:45:11,960
file, open
and make sure that this time you open

2674
03:45:11,960 --> 03:45:18,120
the other project
that you closed on your system.

2675
03:45:18,120 --> 03:45:19,720
Make sure that

2676
03:45:28,920 --> 03:45:29,520
okay,

2677
03:45:29,520 --> 03:45:31,920
so let me know once you have open up your

2678
03:45:33,200 --> 03:45:37,720
other project
and it's going to have no planet one,

2679
03:45:38,040 --> 03:45:42,480
why is it clone Planet one was not there.

2680
03:45:42,600 --> 03:45:48,360
The boot people are working in parallel.

2681
03:45:48,360 --> 03:45:51,160
Okay. And one more thing is

2682
03:45:51,160 --> 03:45:54,800
now you have to simply add

2683
03:45:54,800 --> 03:45:58,000
the feature planet to for Chunky.

2684
03:45:58,000 --> 03:46:00,040
So very similar to that.

2685
03:46:00,400 --> 03:46:02,000
A Java class thing.

2686
03:46:02,000 --> 03:46:04,640
Planet one outside of Planet Q

2687
03:46:07,880 --> 03:46:11,040
And here your characters training

2688
03:46:12,480 --> 03:46:16,560
color as playing size

2689
03:46:18,080 --> 03:46:19,880
so far do also have some color.

2690
03:46:19,880 --> 03:46:32,760
It has some size not in the main code
you will be out of frame,

2691
03:46:32,760 --> 03:46:36,080
but do

2692
03:46:37,040 --> 03:46:42,000
features, let's say

2693
03:46:42,480 --> 03:46:45,720
What's the name of our planet to

2694
03:46:48,480 --> 03:46:50,240
this module I'm counting on?

2695
03:46:50,240 --> 03:46:56,120
You must in out.

2696
03:46:56,120 --> 03:46:58,520
It is going to give us some larger

2697
03:47:02,920 --> 03:47:06,240
blade to us

2698
03:47:06,240 --> 03:47:08,320
based inputs, but

2699
03:47:08,320 --> 03:47:11,880
I don't know how the analysis

2700
03:47:13,360 --> 03:47:14,520
radicals

2701
03:47:15,320 --> 03:47:18,880
sabbatical star photos equals to

2702
03:47:22,880 --> 03:47:23,400
thing.

2703
03:47:23,840 --> 03:47:26,600
Let's make this planet

2704
03:47:29,600 --> 03:47:30,680
inside.

2705
03:47:30,680 --> 03:47:32,480
Let's make it

2706
03:47:40,160 --> 03:47:40,560
okay.

2707
03:47:40,560 --> 03:47:44,600
So we have successfully added features

2708
03:47:44,600 --> 03:47:47,000
for to

2709
03:47:49,200 --> 03:47:50,480
and now

2710
03:47:51,120 --> 03:47:59,360
we need to make a comment.

2711
03:47:59,360 --> 03:48:02,440
But first I need you guys to guide me.

2712
03:48:03,280 --> 03:48:05,040
Where is this Latitude?

2713
03:48:05,040 --> 03:48:11,200
What's going to emerge from?

2714
03:48:11,200 --> 03:48:13,600
My source emerged

2715
03:48:15,840 --> 03:48:17,400
in parallel with Planet

2716
03:48:17,400 --> 03:48:25,200
One, Planet two.

2717
03:48:25,200 --> 03:48:27,840
Okay, now we need to make a comment.

2718
03:48:27,840 --> 03:48:34,080
So open up the terminal which
is associated with this particular code.

2719
03:48:34,080 --> 03:48:35,320
That is, Are you following me?

2720
03:48:35,320 --> 03:48:38,680
I behind because I see no response.

2721
03:48:38,680 --> 03:48:40,960
I'm just moving smoothly.

2722
03:48:41,840 --> 03:48:45,640
I'm assuming that
you guys are able to call up.

2723
03:48:47,560 --> 03:48:48,840
Okay, perfect.

2724
03:48:48,840 --> 03:48:51,600
So see the solar system

2725
03:48:52,800 --> 03:48:55,080
get at dot

2726
03:48:55,520 --> 03:48:57,000
get comment

2727
03:48:57,000 --> 03:49:00,240
dash number
and the message I'll place over here

2728
03:49:01,440 --> 03:49:03,280
the feature

2729
03:49:05,360 --> 03:49:07,880
right to is complete

2730
03:49:11,400 --> 03:49:17,120
the and obviously after that,

2731
03:49:18,000 --> 03:49:19,560
I would say

2732
03:49:20,880 --> 03:49:23,160
push it to GitHub submit

2733
03:49:23,800 --> 03:49:26,320
push that hue

2734
03:49:26,440 --> 03:49:34,200
origin.

2735
03:49:34,200 --> 03:49:36,920
Okay so here we did a mistake

2736
03:49:38,400 --> 03:49:41,400
see how

2737
03:49:43,720 --> 03:49:46,960
unfortunate of me

2738
03:49:51,480 --> 03:49:55,680
the bug on main branch

2739
03:49:55,680 --> 03:49:58,360
and no one reminded me
when to create a branch.

2740
03:49:59,280 --> 03:50:02,840
Oh that's my fault.

2741
03:50:02,840 --> 03:50:07,000
But we are see because

2742
03:50:08,320 --> 03:50:13,120
here we are said
because we have not pushed it yet.

2743
03:50:13,120 --> 03:50:13,760
So this is

2744
03:50:13,760 --> 03:50:17,560
how you are going to be making mistakes
while you will be working on project.

2745
03:50:17,560 --> 03:50:21,000
So just make sure that you do not repeat

2746
03:50:21,000 --> 03:50:23,720
this mistake. Oh.

2747
03:50:24,840 --> 03:50:27,120
Oh. Okay.

2748
03:50:27,120 --> 03:50:29,480
So guys,
what we are going to do right now,

2749
03:50:29,560 --> 03:50:32,760
unfortunately
you have to clone our project again.

2750
03:50:32,800 --> 03:50:35,240
So that's the severity of the issue.

2751
03:50:35,240 --> 03:50:38,120
If you do it incorrectly,
you have to do it again.

2752
03:50:39,000 --> 03:50:46,240
So a lesson for me as well, It

2753
03:50:47,640 --> 03:50:49,520
not at all.

2754
03:50:49,520 --> 03:51:03,840
Why is it okay?

2755
03:51:03,840 --> 03:51:06,240
Yes, we were all doing this
in the main branch.

2756
03:51:06,240 --> 03:51:09,040
I like some.

2757
03:51:09,040 --> 03:51:12,720
We were all working in the main runs
as we use it too.

2758
03:51:13,440 --> 03:51:16,400
So is is that like allowed.

2759
03:51:16,680 --> 03:51:21,440
No, that's not a lot of you
would if you have added but not permitted.

2760
03:51:21,440 --> 03:51:25,640
Non you need to look that is
there is a real for you

2761
03:51:25,640 --> 03:51:28,680
if you are clever enough
but I'm going to tell you that use

2762
03:51:28,680 --> 03:51:36,880
testing somehow
you know just do that. Okay

2763
03:51:37,960 --> 03:51:39,680
so we are going to clone app.

2764
03:51:39,680 --> 03:51:49,880
Just create a being.

2765
03:51:49,880 --> 03:51:52,920
But I'll tell you how to do that.

2766
03:51:52,920 --> 03:51:56,040
But obviously
now that for now I'm not expecting

2767
03:51:56,040 --> 03:52:01,280
you guys to be able to

2768
03:52:01,360 --> 03:52:06,640
do that on your own.

2769
03:52:06,640 --> 03:52:06,880
Look,

2770
03:52:08,360 --> 03:52:10,160
okay, you guys still

2771
03:52:10,440 --> 03:52:11,040
for janky?

2772
03:52:11,040 --> 03:52:13,640
We are doing it again because

2773
03:52:13,640 --> 03:52:18,960
of what's working on the same branch.

2774
03:52:18,960 --> 03:52:21,120
So I'm going to open up the chunky one.

2775
03:52:21,640 --> 03:52:25,360
Now this is open in the project,

2776
03:52:26,360 --> 03:52:30,080
so now it has means or and so
and the first of what you need to do

2777
03:52:30,320 --> 03:52:33,400
is to change the repository,

2778
03:52:34,960 --> 03:52:37,840
change the directory
and create a new branch

2779
03:52:37,840 --> 03:52:40,680
to get branch

2780
03:52:41,760 --> 03:52:45,120
so that it to

2781
03:52:45,120 --> 03:52:48,080
get switch

2782
03:52:48,080 --> 03:52:51,880
is set up, check out planet to

2783
03:52:54,120 --> 03:52:57,200
now you are set to work.

2784
03:52:57,520 --> 03:52:58,000
Okay.

2785
03:52:58,000 --> 03:53:02,520
I would me let me know
once you guys have cloned their game

2786
03:53:02,560 --> 03:53:07,000
and created a new branch planet two
so that we can work

2787
03:53:07,000 --> 03:53:07,600
you know

2788
03:53:12,480 --> 03:53:14,400
you guys I'm going to be

2789
03:53:14,400 --> 03:53:18,000
we deleted the previous repository
of some key

2790
03:53:18,000 --> 03:53:20,640
because we accidentally

2791
03:53:21,480 --> 03:53:24,960
went in the main branch,
which was not allowed of this.

2792
03:53:25,160 --> 03:53:27,520
So we had to record it.

2793
03:53:27,520 --> 03:53:29,800
And after recording, you just simply

2794
03:53:32,880 --> 03:53:37,200
change the planet of the branch.

2795
03:53:38,000 --> 03:53:43,080
Yes, simply click on file
because we will put it.

2796
03:53:43,080 --> 03:53:47,280
And from there
choose the location that you have closed

2797
03:53:47,280 --> 03:53:50,280
your project, click on it and then hit.

2798
03:53:50,400 --> 03:53:54,360
Okay, Nice.

2799
03:53:55,400 --> 03:53:58,040
So now let's go with a simulation.

2800
03:53:58,040 --> 03:54:03,560
We have a planet to created from sea merge
and let's quickly add

2801
03:54:03,640 --> 03:54:06,000
class planet to

2802
03:54:10,440 --> 03:54:12,920
this going to have

2803
03:54:14,760 --> 03:54:15,960
color

2804
03:54:16,680 --> 03:54:18,960
and it's going to have

2805
03:54:20,640 --> 03:54:21,920
size, right?

2806
03:54:21,920 --> 03:54:25,440
So what are we naming of planet
for gravity

2807
03:54:25,440 --> 03:54:26,280
the that

2808
03:54:43,440 --> 03:54:46,920
named non-mainstream Pluton is like Pluto.

2809
03:54:47,480 --> 03:54:48,320
But then

2810
03:54:53,440 --> 03:54:55,960
a planet to

2811
03:54:56,640 --> 03:54:58,400
that school type

2812
03:55:03,320 --> 03:55:05,720
on that is Uranus is also a planet.

2813
03:55:05,720 --> 03:55:07,960
I want to come up with no new names.

2814
03:55:08,280 --> 03:55:11,800
You're not creating our solar
and we are creating a new sort of system.

2815
03:55:12,120 --> 03:55:19,560
Now let's name it.

2816
03:55:19,560 --> 03:55:23,360
So now what we need to do is carry on.

2817
03:55:23,880 --> 03:55:29,520
Color is equal to yellow.

2818
03:55:29,520 --> 03:55:44,640
Prime dot size equals two.

2819
03:55:44,640 --> 03:55:46,200
Okay, let me know once

2820
03:55:46,200 --> 03:55:53,640
you have done to this point, can you show
you mean after you finish? Yes.

2821
03:55:53,640 --> 03:55:55,840
Maybe this is the main. I have it.

2822
03:55:56,400 --> 03:55:57,640
Which then are you talking about?

2823
03:55:57,640 --> 03:56:03,080
Main branch.

2824
03:56:03,080 --> 03:56:04,920
And are you talking about me Branch

2825
03:56:07,840 --> 03:56:10,000
of the planet to

2826
03:56:10,760 --> 03:56:12,960
current size of the deficit?

2827
03:56:12,960 --> 03:56:21,800
Nothing else.

2828
03:56:21,800 --> 03:56:22,400
Okay, guys.

2829
03:56:22,400 --> 03:56:27,280
So now this particular user
chunky is going to open up is terminal

2830
03:56:27,960 --> 03:56:30,880
is going to make sure for us
that he's in the correct branch

2831
03:56:32,000 --> 03:56:34,280
and then he's going to come in

2832
03:56:35,360 --> 03:56:38,360
of the now he's going to say, get

2833
03:56:41,520 --> 03:56:45,520
add dot, get comment.

2834
03:56:45,840 --> 03:56:47,640
That's where

2835
03:56:48,800 --> 03:56:53,880
the planet to specification feature

2836
03:56:56,520 --> 03:57:03,760
has been added.

2837
03:57:03,760 --> 03:57:06,800
Okay, let me know once you are done.

2838
03:57:07,080 --> 03:57:21,440
So this form.

2839
03:57:21,440 --> 03:57:23,200
What's up, guys? What's what?

2840
03:57:23,200 --> 03:57:35,040
What about the rest of you?

2841
03:57:35,040 --> 03:57:36,720
Okay, so

2842
03:57:36,920 --> 03:57:39,360
now get push.

2843
03:57:39,560 --> 03:57:43,120
Matthew Origin latitude

2844
03:57:44,200 --> 03:57:47,720
and we are sending this flash

2845
03:57:47,760 --> 03:57:54,480
to get up,
so I'll create a comment over here.

2846
03:57:55,040 --> 03:58:01,440
Simply like this.

2847
03:58:01,440 --> 03:58:13,440
Let's see, six.

2848
03:58:13,440 --> 03:58:17,680
So this is what have been done up

2849
03:58:17,680 --> 03:58:26,680
till now, right?

2850
03:58:26,680 --> 03:58:27,480
Okay.

2851
03:58:27,960 --> 03:58:31,840
Now we need to merge it.

2852
03:58:31,840 --> 03:58:35,920
We need to merge the Planet one
and we need to merge the planet two

2853
03:58:36,440 --> 03:58:40,920
so that utilize two this person
our team right.

2854
03:58:40,920 --> 03:58:42,000
So let's say that

2855
03:58:43,080 --> 03:58:44,560
we have

2856
03:58:44,560 --> 03:58:47,640
opened up the pull requests
and stuff like that.

2857
03:58:47,640 --> 03:58:49,520
We have done that already.

2858
03:58:49,520 --> 03:58:51,840
We are just assuming
we will do that obviously

2859
03:58:53,160 --> 03:58:55,080
and our team we

2860
03:58:55,080 --> 03:58:58,440
before he actually holds the code

2861
03:58:58,600 --> 03:59:00,680
on merges it you you said

2862
03:59:01,680 --> 03:59:03,960
I would like to review it

2863
03:59:04,200 --> 03:59:09,320
on my own computer.

2864
03:59:09,320 --> 03:59:11,960
So what he's going to do,

2865
03:59:12,240 --> 03:59:14,480
he's going to open up his project.

2866
03:59:14,640 --> 03:59:19,800
Let's say he was working on the project
that we had in which we were.

2867
03:59:19,800 --> 03:59:21,600
We have no planet.

2868
03:59:21,600 --> 03:59:23,200
Can we go to that project?

2869
03:59:23,200 --> 03:59:28,440
We all have that.

2870
03:59:28,440 --> 03:59:33,280
Let's pretend that this is the project
that belongs to the Kiwi.

2871
03:59:33,280 --> 03:59:37,840
And he it's his computer,
but let's open up

2872
03:59:38,160 --> 03:59:40,320
the terminal associated with it.

2873
03:59:41,720 --> 03:59:43,440
So it's idea

2874
03:59:43,440 --> 03:59:46,920
project solar System for me,
whatever is for you, let me

2875
03:59:48,960 --> 03:59:51,480
once you are have opened

2876
03:59:55,360 --> 03:59:57,520
the I don't know this point

2877
03:59:57,520 --> 04:00:01,080
all of you know if I problem fast
let me know

2878
04:00:01,080 --> 04:00:05,040
because I really want you all to be in
sync with me.

2879
04:00:05,840 --> 04:00:12,360
This is an important concept.

2880
04:00:12,360 --> 04:00:16,640
Okay, then quickly open it right now. This

2881
04:00:17,680 --> 04:00:19,920
you want to write Alex.

2882
04:00:19,920 --> 04:00:24,040
Why do you?

2883
04:00:25,560 --> 04:00:29,600
I wrote it.

2884
04:00:29,600 --> 04:00:36,920
Oh, you found that out.

2885
04:00:36,920 --> 04:00:39,840
I really want you to be confident
about your steps.

2886
04:00:39,840 --> 04:00:40,320
Okay?

2887
04:00:40,320 --> 04:00:43,120
The decisions you are taking,
you should be confident about

2888
04:00:46,640 --> 04:00:46,840
that.

2889
04:00:46,840 --> 04:00:48,360
I literally.

2890
04:00:48,360 --> 04:00:50,800
I literally said like this.

2891
04:00:50,800 --> 04:00:53,520
Like there's a gun pointed to my head,
but right.

2892
04:00:53,520 --> 04:00:56,280
Fine. I

2893
04:00:56,880 --> 04:00:59,960
So now let's see, get branch.

2894
04:01:00,280 --> 04:01:03,000
It gives me only the mean and start

2895
04:01:03,080 --> 04:01:05,880
get someone tell me why

2896
04:01:22,240 --> 04:01:23,880
we got a bit from GitHub.

2897
04:01:23,880 --> 04:01:26,200
So what do you guys suggest?

2898
04:01:26,200 --> 04:01:27,240
How do we update update

2899
04:01:35,120 --> 04:01:37,400
pull that

2900
04:01:37,400 --> 04:01:43,080
collect to get that.

2901
04:01:43,080 --> 04:01:46,360
It's showing me
that there are two branches

2902
04:01:46,360 --> 04:01:51,440
which are planet one and planet two.

2903
04:01:51,440 --> 04:01:53,520
Okay, let's do not get full

2904
04:01:59,720 --> 04:02:05,400
it that it's already up to date.

2905
04:02:05,400 --> 04:02:20,640
What now?

2906
04:02:20,640 --> 04:02:25,400
Okay, so here is a little bit concept
that I want to deliver to you.

2907
04:02:25,400 --> 04:02:26,360
That's

2908
04:02:31,440 --> 04:02:32,280
the only that you got.

2909
04:02:32,280 --> 04:02:34,320
Fast forward merge
because you might have done

2910
04:02:34,320 --> 04:02:38,280
something different
that should not be considering.

2911
04:02:38,280 --> 04:02:39,040
Okay,

2912
04:02:40,160 --> 04:02:42,600
There must be something different.

2913
04:02:42,600 --> 04:02:42,960
Okay.

2914
04:02:42,960 --> 04:02:46,040
So the concept over here
that I wanted to share with you is that

2915
04:02:46,920 --> 04:02:49,800
whenever we have a new branch,

2916
04:02:49,800 --> 04:02:54,960
whenever we have a new branch on GitHub,

2917
04:02:54,960 --> 04:02:58,200
in order to have that locally,

2918
04:02:58,200 --> 04:03:01,560
we need to do some different steps.

2919
04:03:01,560 --> 04:03:04,080
We cannot do it using full

2920
04:03:05,400 --> 04:03:09,480
get code
updates, the code of the same branch.

2921
04:03:09,960 --> 04:03:12,640
It does not download new branches

2922
04:03:12,640 --> 04:03:17,160
for you in order to have new branches
that appear on GitHub

2923
04:03:17,520 --> 04:03:20,160
in your local repository.

2924
04:03:20,160 --> 04:03:24,560
First, use the command git branch dash in.

2925
04:03:24,560 --> 04:03:30,880
Now the one in the letter that you see
on the branches that are there on GitHub.

2926
04:03:32,160 --> 04:03:34,120
Okay.

2927
04:03:34,120 --> 04:03:37,400
So if you want to have that one,
you simply

2928
04:03:37,400 --> 04:03:40,320
write, check out

2929
04:03:40,720 --> 04:03:43,280
Planet one

2930
04:03:43,280 --> 04:03:46,000
and it's going to download the Planet
one branch

2931
04:03:46,080 --> 04:03:50,760
where you guys group Planet one is there.

2932
04:03:50,760 --> 04:03:54,840
So we want to let it one
and we also want Planet two, right?

2933
04:03:54,960 --> 04:03:57,400
So I say get check out

2934
04:03:58,440 --> 04:04:03,880
planet two.

2935
04:04:03,880 --> 04:04:08,120
So now I have downloaded Planet two also

2936
04:04:12,360 --> 04:04:15,560
and now I simply switch to get check out

2937
04:04:17,880 --> 04:04:18,920
member.

2938
04:04:20,240 --> 04:04:24,200
So now I'm on back
my back to my main branch

2939
04:04:25,920 --> 04:04:28,320
and if I show you that branch

2940
04:04:29,360 --> 04:04:31,960
I have all the branches, planet
one and planet

2941
04:04:31,960 --> 04:04:36,080
to download it in my local repository.

2942
04:04:36,440 --> 04:04:44,400
So that clear to all of you.

2943
04:04:44,400 --> 04:04:49,760
All of these steps have these branches
black one and black two on your system and

2944
04:05:47,520 --> 04:05:50,280
person both the screenshot in support.

2945
04:05:50,880 --> 04:05:51,720
Yes. Yes.

2946
04:05:51,720 --> 04:05:54,880
So let's ask the question noise.

2947
04:05:55,200 --> 04:06:01,880
Sorry, I was just busy.

2948
04:06:01,880 --> 04:06:02,560
Go ahead ask.

2949
04:06:02,560 --> 04:06:07,640
It's a no, it's fine.

2950
04:06:07,640 --> 04:06:10,200
Any questions are entertained.

2951
04:06:11,000 --> 04:06:12,240
No words

2952
04:06:15,480 --> 04:06:16,240
or too like.

2953
04:06:16,240 --> 04:06:16,520
Right.

2954
04:06:16,520 --> 04:06:16,800
Okay.

2955
04:06:16,800 --> 04:06:19,720
Just send me off of the class right now.

2956
04:06:19,720 --> 04:06:20,320
You want to.

2957
04:06:20,320 --> 04:06:29,480
I okay.

2958
04:06:29,480 --> 04:06:32,840
So are we good

2959
04:06:35,440 --> 04:06:36,560
for hard?

2960
04:06:36,560 --> 04:06:38,520
So they should be go a lot, right?

2961
04:06:38,520 --> 04:06:40,120
Do we have those letters?

2962
04:06:40,120 --> 04:06:47,640
Mostly.

2963
04:06:47,640 --> 04:06:49,920
Okay. So

2964
04:06:50,040 --> 04:06:53,080
does everyone synchronized with me
till this one?

2965
04:06:54,080 --> 04:06:57,560
Because the next thing that I'm going
to teach you, it's a new concept

2966
04:06:58,240 --> 04:07:01,600
I really want you to understand
is this is the major

2967
04:07:02,760 --> 04:07:05,280
portion of

2968
04:07:05,280 --> 04:07:10,680
merging.

2969
04:07:10,680 --> 04:07:13,920
It's a little bit difficult to grasp,

2970
04:07:13,920 --> 04:07:18,240
so I need your complete attention.

2971
04:07:18,240 --> 04:07:20,480
Take 2 minutes,

2972
04:07:20,760 --> 04:07:24,120
refresh your brain, excel in here.

2973
04:07:25,400 --> 04:07:27,400
And now let's tackle

2974
04:07:27,400 --> 04:08:08,840
to together.

2975
04:08:08,840 --> 04:08:11,400
Yes, you can have

2976
04:08:19,520 --> 04:08:20,520
the mute.

2977
04:08:21,400 --> 04:08:22,840
That's why I mentioned that.

2978
04:08:22,840 --> 04:08:26,760
Just to forget about how easy
the syntax is.

2979
04:08:26,760 --> 04:08:28,440
Just focus on

2980
04:08:33,000 --> 04:08:35,280
the time that

2981
04:08:36,360 --> 04:08:43,560
what kind of push is that?

2982
04:08:43,560 --> 04:08:48,800
What get.

2983
04:08:48,800 --> 04:08:51,400
Yes, I know what's what.

2984
04:08:51,400 --> 04:08:53,280
Obviously I do.

2985
04:08:53,520 --> 04:08:54,240
Okay then.

2986
04:08:54,240 --> 04:08:58,040
Okay.

2987
04:08:58,040 --> 04:09:01,040
Please lower the console a little bit.

2988
04:09:01,040 --> 04:09:03,440
Okay. So

2989
04:09:04,680 --> 04:09:06,800
like, this is just good

2990
04:09:06,800 --> 04:09:12,240
enough.

2991
04:09:12,240 --> 04:09:13,320
Yeah.

2992
04:09:13,520 --> 04:09:14,200
Okay.

2993
04:09:14,200 --> 04:09:17,400
With the technical, right.

2994
04:09:17,400 --> 04:09:18,600
It's just a one of the players.

2995
04:09:18,600 --> 04:09:23,040
Cool in the main class is about ten,
but the class does feel

2996
04:09:23,040 --> 04:09:26,880
right and used.

2997
04:09:26,880 --> 04:09:29,520
Let me switch to one of the planets.

2998
04:09:29,520 --> 04:09:32,800
Like you mean when we switch to one
of the branch of the planets, Right.

2999
04:09:33,680 --> 04:09:37,200
Who would in the main class press

3000
04:09:37,840 --> 04:09:41,640
about the planet? No.

3001
04:09:41,640 --> 04:09:42,600
And I'm of the glass.

3002
04:09:42,600 --> 04:09:45,080
Also peers Who said that? Why?

3003
04:09:45,080 --> 04:09:46,200
While I didn't.

3004
04:09:46,400 --> 04:09:52,920
I'll show you that.

3005
04:09:52,920 --> 04:09:54,080
Cause that possible.

3006
04:09:54,080 --> 04:09:58,600
If we have another class that works,
it will appear it's impossible that.

3007
04:09:58,600 --> 04:09:59,960
It will not appear

3008
04:10:06,240 --> 04:10:08,280
mobilized to 2 minutes.

3009
04:10:08,280 --> 04:10:09,880
This more than that.

3010
04:10:09,880 --> 04:10:10,680
That is passed.

3011
04:10:10,680 --> 04:10:13,440
I'm expecting now, hoping
that all of you have joined it.

3012
04:10:13,440 --> 04:10:16,080
So I'm going to quickly

3013
04:10:23,640 --> 04:10:25,320
I'm at the same that

3014
04:10:25,320 --> 04:10:27,880
the class of that planet did not appear.

3015
04:10:28,080 --> 04:10:29,520
Not that planet.

3016
04:10:29,520 --> 04:10:33,480
You know, this is talking about the class.

3017
04:10:33,480 --> 04:10:36,080
So I'm going to switch to

3018
04:10:37,280 --> 04:10:40,160
get checked out

3019
04:10:40,320 --> 04:10:43,760
planet to now.

3020
04:10:43,760 --> 04:10:47,360
I like to open up that

3021
04:10:48,480 --> 04:10:50,560
project
and I'm going to make sure that I'm

3022
04:10:50,560 --> 04:10:54,440
in the project IDEA Project Solar System.

3023
04:10:54,960 --> 04:10:58,280
I have the main code
and I have the Planet two.

3024
04:10:58,760 --> 04:11:01,200
So that was not a period for you.

3025
04:11:01,200 --> 04:11:03,240
You might have something wrong.

3026
04:11:03,480 --> 04:11:06,600
Okay?

3027
04:11:06,600 --> 04:11:14,080
You might have skipped some steps.

3028
04:11:14,080 --> 04:11:15,360
Okay, so you'll be done.

3029
04:11:15,360 --> 04:11:22,720
Do you want me to switch to that one? No.

3030
04:11:22,720 --> 04:11:25,760
Here, check out

3031
04:11:27,320 --> 04:11:33,240
Planet one.

3032
04:11:33,240 --> 04:11:35,280
Okay, Now I will show you Planet one.

3033
04:11:35,280 --> 04:11:38,840
So there is a code for Planet
One and class for that

3034
04:11:38,960 --> 04:11:46,960
one to.

3035
04:11:46,960 --> 04:11:49,440
So, yeah, this is how it should be, right?

3036
04:11:49,920 --> 04:11:53,040
We are switching to those blogs
in which we updated the code,

3037
04:11:53,040 --> 04:11:55,920
we wrote the new features
and they are appearing to us

3038
04:11:56,160 --> 04:11:59,360
as it is, it should be sampler.

3039
04:11:59,600 --> 04:12:03,040
One gift is saying
if you are not having this,

3040
04:12:03,400 --> 04:12:10,440
then it means that you did something
wrong.

3041
04:12:10,440 --> 04:12:13,400
Well, if it did not download, how did it

3042
04:12:13,600 --> 04:12:24,360
manage to switch or hard?

3043
04:12:24,360 --> 04:12:28,640
And this one shows you planet
one of the planet two, right?

3044
04:12:29,040 --> 04:12:36,400
That means that there are no
in your representative.

3045
04:12:36,400 --> 04:12:39,280
Okay, guys, so let's move forward.

3046
04:12:39,320 --> 04:12:42,120
A lot of time has been spent.

3047
04:12:42,120 --> 04:12:44,880
So again, check out Main.

3048
04:12:45,880 --> 04:12:48,760
So I'm checking out to meet my main one.

3049
04:12:48,760 --> 04:12:52,760
So right now it might encourage
if I show you I only have name

3050
04:12:57,200 --> 04:13:00,400
problem so that how can we have all the

3051
04:13:01,480 --> 04:13:10,120
branches opened at the same time.

3052
04:13:10,120 --> 04:13:12,240
I would you want that.

3053
04:13:12,240 --> 04:13:18,800
That's it's impossible to do that.

3054
04:13:18,800 --> 04:13:19,680
Yes exactly.

3055
04:13:19,680 --> 04:13:22,680
If you check out
then you will be taken to do that.

3056
04:13:23,040 --> 04:13:26,480
You cannot simultaneously
open up to branches.

3057
04:13:27,040 --> 04:13:28,760
What are you working with?

3058
04:13:28,760 --> 04:13:38,280
One hand on one branch
and the other hand on the other one.

3059
04:13:38,280 --> 04:13:41,240
Yeah. Sorry,
but you got to do that, right?

3060
04:13:41,240 --> 04:13:45,560
So you have to say,
okay, so let's get back to our main

3061
04:13:45,760 --> 04:13:48,680
discussion.

3062
04:13:48,680 --> 04:13:52,520
This is pretty interesting conversation
that that is going to happen.

3063
04:13:52,800 --> 04:13:54,440
I'm really excited about it

3064
04:13:54,440 --> 04:13:56,760
and I'm really excited
that you guys do understand it,

3065
04:13:56,760 --> 04:13:58,360
so I'll recommend you one thing.

3066
04:13:58,360 --> 04:14:00,640
Start doing everything okay.

3067
04:14:01,040 --> 04:14:09,120
First, the concept that is important.

3068
04:14:09,120 --> 04:14:10,080
Okay, let's

3069
04:14:17,080 --> 04:14:19,200
can you guys name the number of classes

3070
04:14:20,560 --> 04:14:23,040
that we have?

3071
04:14:23,040 --> 04:14:24,480
See, merge

3072
04:14:30,120 --> 04:14:31,160
having them name

3073
04:14:31,160 --> 04:14:37,760
the classes and see merge,
which is our main branch.

3074
04:14:37,760 --> 04:14:41,760
Obviously guys,

3075
04:14:41,760 --> 04:14:45,000
the classes that we had,
we had just named them for me.

3076
04:14:45,000 --> 04:14:46,040
Please.

3077
04:14:46,520 --> 04:14:47,560
Thank you.

3078
04:14:47,560 --> 04:14:50,040
So we have some

3079
04:14:51,000 --> 04:15:01,440
we have our system.

3080
04:15:01,440 --> 04:15:03,720
We have the other one which is

3081
04:15:04,800 --> 04:15:15,920
name.

3082
04:15:15,920 --> 04:15:20,360
Okay, how do you guys name
the classes that we have in C five

3083
04:15:20,880 --> 04:15:23,400
that like Planet one branch categories,

3084
04:15:23,400 --> 04:15:35,240
name their.

3085
04:15:35,240 --> 04:15:37,840
We just have one expert, right?

3086
04:15:37,840 --> 04:15:40,120
Which is planet one. Right?

3087
04:15:40,120 --> 04:15:42,240
To be very precise

3088
04:15:42,360 --> 04:15:43,520
what extra class.

3089
04:15:43,520 --> 04:15:57,960
Sorry.

3090
04:15:57,960 --> 04:16:01,320
And for planet two we have almost the same

3091
04:16:02,040 --> 04:16:05,200
only it's planet two
instead of planet one.

3092
04:16:05,880 --> 04:16:08,280
That's how it is, right?

3093
04:16:08,280 --> 04:16:12,880
Anyone who does not agree with me
or wants to stand out and say no,

3094
04:16:13,680 --> 04:16:17,280
I'm not saying correct.

3095
04:16:17,280 --> 04:16:18,880
I mean, you are every ten.

3096
04:16:18,880 --> 04:16:21,360
Q For that, I appreciate your

3097
04:16:22,760 --> 04:16:24,720
cooperation.

3098
04:16:25,560 --> 04:16:26,280
Yeah.

3099
04:16:26,280 --> 04:16:29,720
One upset wants to point a gun towards
my head.

3100
04:16:30,120 --> 04:16:31,560
Please don't do that.

3101
04:16:31,560 --> 04:16:36,480
The arrow, the planet.

3102
04:16:36,520 --> 04:16:39,960
Our solar is doing the main code

3103
04:16:39,960 --> 04:16:42,680
like the

3104
04:16:43,120 --> 04:16:46,160
this is the solar system class

3105
04:16:48,400 --> 04:16:51,920
of Okay, guys.

3106
04:16:51,920 --> 04:16:55,720
So if all of you got it

3107
04:16:55,720 --> 04:16:58,880
in the first go,

3108
04:16:58,880 --> 04:17:02,240
then we are going to get an ugly off.

3109
04:17:03,920 --> 04:17:11,680
So let's do that.

3110
04:17:11,680 --> 04:17:15,600
I will try to explain it
right here in New York team.

3111
04:17:15,720 --> 04:17:19,800
That's why I have this names right?

3112
04:17:19,800 --> 04:17:21,120
Okay.

3113
04:17:21,600 --> 04:17:27,480
So now tell me that
if I first being a team

3114
04:17:27,480 --> 04:17:32,520
lead,
I want to check the future Planet one.

3115
04:17:32,520 --> 04:17:35,760
What will I do?

3116
04:17:35,760 --> 04:17:38,960
I want to make sure that Planet
One feature is working fine.

3117
04:17:38,960 --> 04:17:41,280
I have downloaded the branches.

3118
04:17:41,640 --> 04:17:45,240
So what should I do?

3119
04:17:45,240 --> 04:17:47,560
I'll open up the terminal.

3120
04:17:47,560 --> 04:17:49,840
I do get check out

3121
04:17:52,800 --> 04:17:54,760
planet one.

3122
04:17:55,720 --> 04:17:59,200
I'll open up the cool.

3123
04:17:59,200 --> 04:18:01,080
It has that one.

3124
04:18:01,080 --> 04:18:03,880
The password system, the test on

3125
04:18:06,080 --> 04:18:09,200
and it tells me first. So

3126
04:18:12,480 --> 04:18:15,720
I'm going to copy this for reference.

3127
04:18:17,280 --> 04:18:19,120
I'm going to play this code.

3128
04:18:19,120 --> 04:18:20,200
LC Okay.

3129
04:18:20,200 --> 04:18:25,920
And one is breaking final pretty good.

3130
04:18:25,920 --> 04:18:28,080
So I check the planet one.

3131
04:18:28,080 --> 04:18:30,880
It was working fine.

3132
04:18:31,200 --> 04:18:55,880
What is the next step that I'll be?

3133
04:18:55,880 --> 04:18:57,360
Okay, So you guys are seeing that.

3134
04:18:57,360 --> 04:19:04,640
I'll check out that tuna.

3135
04:19:04,640 --> 04:19:08,040
Okay,
so I take the planet to go to calculate.

3136
04:19:08,400 --> 04:19:10,920
I'll have a look at the code

3137
04:19:10,960 --> 04:19:13,840
s working good planet two of.

3138
04:19:13,840 --> 04:19:15,480
That's awesome.

3139
04:19:15,480 --> 04:19:18,360
You know, it's perfect.

3140
04:19:18,360 --> 04:19:21,000
So I would say that it too is working

3141
04:19:22,120 --> 04:19:22,680
great.

3142
04:19:22,680 --> 04:19:26,040
You okay?

3143
04:19:26,480 --> 04:19:33,120
So I have this code
just for their accents.

3144
04:19:33,120 --> 04:19:34,800
I'll be nice after that.

3145
04:19:36,160 --> 04:19:37,960
What do I do now?

3146
04:19:38,640 --> 04:19:43,080
I have checked both groups.

3147
04:19:43,080 --> 04:19:46,640
Okay, Now
I need to merge them into the main plot.

3148
04:19:46,680 --> 04:19:49,680
That's our target.

3149
04:19:49,680 --> 04:19:51,880
Now, you think for that? Louder.

3150
04:19:52,080 --> 04:19:54,000
You should be sure about it.

3151
04:19:54,000 --> 04:19:57,880
So how are you going to watch one of them?

3152
04:19:57,880 --> 04:19:59,240
One or something? You see?

3153
04:19:59,240 --> 04:20:09,600
What do you take?

3154
04:20:09,600 --> 04:20:11,400
One by one, obviously.

3155
04:20:11,400 --> 04:20:17,760
Obviously we are going to go one by one.

3156
04:20:17,760 --> 04:20:18,640
Okay.

3157
04:20:18,640 --> 04:20:21,880
So can you guys

3158
04:20:21,880 --> 04:20:26,160
can you guys at this point see that?

3159
04:20:26,160 --> 04:20:28,600
Where will the conflict be

3160
04:20:29,920 --> 04:20:32,440
when we will merge Planet one

3161
04:20:32,440 --> 04:20:37,640
and two? All?

3162
04:20:37,640 --> 04:20:46,080
Is it going to be Planet two?

3163
04:20:46,080 --> 04:20:51,160
Has anyone else worked on planet
You know, no one bit.

3164
04:20:51,160 --> 04:20:53,520
It's not going to be Planet two.

3165
04:20:53,520 --> 04:21:03,000
Is it going to be Planet one?

3166
04:21:03,000 --> 04:21:04,760
Is there going to be any consequence?

3167
04:21:04,760 --> 04:21:07,080
I won't know because no one word on

3168
04:21:08,320 --> 04:21:09,880
planet one

3169
04:21:10,120 --> 04:21:11,280
except

3170
04:21:11,880 --> 04:21:13,400
that one.

3171
04:21:13,400 --> 04:21:23,520
Is there
going to be a conflict in me? Yes.

3172
04:21:23,520 --> 04:21:27,400
Because then in one added his planet

3173
04:21:27,880 --> 04:21:32,320
in main and planet
two also on this planet in name.

3174
04:21:32,560 --> 04:21:35,960
So we can literally visualize that yes,

3175
04:21:35,960 --> 04:21:39,480
there is going to be a conflict.

3176
04:21:39,480 --> 04:21:46,600
If I show you these good side by side,
you will see for yourself, Let me do this.

3177
04:21:46,600 --> 04:21:50,000
Yeah.

3178
04:21:50,000 --> 04:21:52,800
So now we got to apply one cool

3179
04:21:54,200 --> 04:21:54,680
online.

3180
04:21:54,680 --> 04:21:57,800
Number 17
We have added Planet One features

3181
04:21:58,560 --> 04:22:02,880
there eyes on this line of ozone
you have to by is equal to new planet

3182
04:22:02,880 --> 04:22:07,680
to the B
there is a conflict at this point right

3183
04:22:08,160 --> 04:22:10,480
candidate C that

3184
04:22:11,720 --> 04:22:13,840
okay so this is a conflict

3185
04:22:14,240 --> 04:22:16,720
now we all want a conflict happens.

3186
04:22:17,160 --> 04:22:20,920
So I'm going to show you this conflict
in real time.

3187
04:22:20,920 --> 04:22:21,320
Okay.

3188
04:22:21,320 --> 04:22:43,080
So what is the first name?

3189
04:22:43,080 --> 04:22:43,480
Okay.

3190
04:22:44,800 --> 04:22:46,120
Okay.

3191
04:22:46,120 --> 04:22:54,560
So first of all, let's merge planet
One with the main.

3192
04:22:54,560 --> 04:22:56,640
Okay. So

3193
04:22:56,640 --> 04:23:05,400
which kind of merge is going to happen?

3194
04:23:05,400 --> 04:23:07,520
Okay, so get this going to check that

3195
04:23:08,920 --> 04:23:11,280
when planet one was created

3196
04:23:11,960 --> 04:23:14,600
the history was seeing merge

3197
04:23:14,600 --> 04:23:16,760
are the last time it was seen merge.

3198
04:23:18,000 --> 04:23:21,560
When we applied to merge back
it's going to check

3199
04:23:21,720 --> 04:23:24,640
is is the last time it still see

3200
04:23:24,640 --> 04:23:27,880
merge yes or no.

3201
04:23:27,880 --> 04:23:30,160
So it is still seamless.

3202
04:23:30,160 --> 04:23:32,840
The commission of the fast forward
merge is

3203
04:23:35,680 --> 04:23:37,360
completed

3204
04:23:38,600 --> 04:23:41,200
so a faster merge will happen.

3205
04:23:41,200 --> 04:23:43,280
That is the question is in fact,

3206
04:23:43,880 --> 04:23:49,360
do we have any conflicts?

3207
04:23:49,360 --> 04:23:50,880
No we don't.

3208
04:23:50,880 --> 04:23:54,720
Everything is basically override.

3209
04:23:54,720 --> 04:23:56,640
So this is something

3210
04:23:56,640 --> 04:24:06,920
that's going to happen right.

3211
04:24:06,920 --> 04:24:07,320
Okay.

3212
04:24:07,320 --> 04:24:12,360
So I'm going to decide this for both. So

3213
04:24:17,040 --> 04:24:22,440
what?

3214
04:24:22,440 --> 04:24:27,880
Okay, so let's go ahead and do this.

3215
04:24:27,880 --> 04:24:29,640
Fast forward much.

3216
04:24:29,640 --> 04:24:32,160
I'll open up my terminal.

3217
04:24:32,480 --> 04:24:32,800
Okay.

3218
04:24:32,800 --> 04:24:36,200
In order to do this, merge,
what should I do

3219
04:24:36,600 --> 04:24:51,520
in my very first step?

3220
04:24:51,520 --> 04:24:53,640
It's the main terminal.

3221
04:24:53,640 --> 04:24:57,360
It's the terminal
which is with that particular one.

3222
04:24:57,880 --> 04:25:00,240
Yes, exactly. Get check out me. Very good.

3223
04:25:00,520 --> 04:25:02,320
I'm really proud of you guys.

3224
04:25:02,320 --> 04:25:04,360
Remember everything.

3225
04:25:04,560 --> 04:25:11,120
Okay, the next step.

3226
04:25:11,120 --> 04:25:12,320
Give me the commander.

3227
04:25:12,320 --> 04:25:14,880
Which commander am I going to write?

3228
04:25:14,880 --> 04:25:28,080
Not to do this much?

3229
04:25:28,080 --> 04:25:33,240
Get merged so that it one.

3230
04:25:33,240 --> 04:25:33,680
Right.

3231
04:25:34,680 --> 04:25:37,440
Okay, so the type of merge happening

3232
04:25:37,440 --> 04:25:41,040
is fast forward as we discussed.

3233
04:25:42,120 --> 04:25:47,000
Perfect. Now

3234
04:25:49,400 --> 04:25:51,600
this is something that happens.

3235
04:25:51,600 --> 04:25:53,280
Okay, great.

3236
04:25:54,120 --> 04:25:58,680
Now it's time for us to merge
the planet to

3237
04:26:03,400 --> 04:26:06,920
the members that when this thing was made,

3238
04:26:07,040 --> 04:26:12,160
history was seen merge.

3239
04:26:12,160 --> 04:26:13,920
Now we are trying to

3240
04:26:18,200 --> 04:26:21,120
merge it back to me is the history

3241
04:26:22,600 --> 04:26:23,760
the latest test.

3242
04:26:23,760 --> 04:26:30,000
We are the latest to make stealthy merge.

3243
04:26:30,000 --> 04:26:32,560
No, it's now c file

3244
04:26:33,560 --> 04:26:39,120
will ever be possible.

3245
04:26:39,120 --> 04:26:45,960
Nil at that is not going to be possible.

3246
04:26:45,960 --> 04:26:46,800
Okay.

3247
04:26:46,800 --> 04:26:49,240
So in this scenario

3248
04:26:49,800 --> 04:26:54,120
then f is not possible.

3249
04:26:54,120 --> 04:26:57,840
Get has to

3250
04:26:58,240 --> 04:27:00,480
apply other

3251
04:27:01,400 --> 04:27:05,120
strategies of merging
which are recursive merge

3252
04:27:05,320 --> 04:27:09,320
and some other kind of rebase are either

3253
04:27:09,720 --> 04:27:12,000
merging strategies
out there in the market.

3254
04:27:13,080 --> 04:27:15,680
We will discuss them in detail,
but not today.

3255
04:27:15,840 --> 04:27:19,200
We'll discuss them tomorrow,
but we will be discussing

3256
04:27:20,000 --> 04:27:25,080
this particular off market East.

3257
04:27:25,080 --> 04:27:28,680
So super merging it
actually we are seeing that what happens.

3258
04:27:29,040 --> 04:27:32,720
First of all,
I want to ask you my question to you is,

3259
04:27:33,400 --> 04:27:36,600
if possible, is not happening

3260
04:27:37,840 --> 04:27:39,480
or is not possible,

3261
04:27:41,040 --> 04:27:42,080
is that statement

3262
04:27:42,080 --> 04:27:57,920
true or false?

3263
04:27:57,920 --> 04:28:07,520
Is this statement true or false?

3264
04:28:07,520 --> 04:28:07,800
Okay.

3265
04:28:07,800 --> 04:28:09,600
Let me find it

3266
04:28:16,200 --> 04:28:17,400
now. Time

3267
04:28:19,920 --> 04:28:36,480
true or false?

3268
04:28:36,480 --> 04:28:39,680
I guess everybody answer like this.

3269
04:28:39,720 --> 04:28:42,840
You guys like we you just

3270
04:28:42,840 --> 04:28:44,880
turn we answer like get it.

3271
04:28:45,400 --> 04:28:51,320
But firstly, so

3272
04:28:53,400 --> 04:28:55,480
it is that if no f if

3273
04:28:56,960 --> 04:28:59,760
other.

3274
04:28:59,760 --> 04:29:01,320
Okay, let me explain it to you.

3275
04:29:01,320 --> 04:29:05,520
I'm saying
that if fast forward is not possible,

3276
04:29:05,520 --> 04:29:08,760
it means that history has been G
So the statement

3277
04:29:08,760 --> 04:29:12,080
that it is necessary
then there will be a conflict.

3278
04:29:12,160 --> 04:29:14,480
It's true or false? Obviously it's false.

3279
04:29:15,000 --> 04:29:18,000
We still don't know
whether there will be a conflict or not.

3280
04:29:18,000 --> 04:29:18,600
It's not.

3281
04:29:18,600 --> 04:29:23,520
And for a conflict, right. Why?

3282
04:29:23,840 --> 04:29:27,080
Because in this scenario
you are telling me that if main power

3283
04:29:27,120 --> 04:29:34,640
was not present,
that would not happen in any conflict.

3284
04:29:34,640 --> 04:29:38,760
Well, now we merge the funds.

3285
04:29:38,760 --> 04:29:41,240
And because the merge or any other merge,

3286
04:29:42,520 --> 04:29:43,280
no conflict.

3287
04:29:43,280 --> 04:29:43,720
Exactly.

3288
04:29:43,720 --> 04:29:48,160
Because none of them worked
on the same file, a conflict occurs

3289
04:29:48,560 --> 04:29:52,240
when someone changed the thing lines

3290
04:29:52,440 --> 04:29:56,160
of the file with a different kind of code.

3291
04:29:56,160 --> 04:29:58,240
Right.

3292
04:29:58,240 --> 04:30:01,720
So now do you guys get it
that it is necessary that there will be

3293
04:30:01,720 --> 04:30:04,840
a conflict is actually a false statement?

3294
04:30:04,840 --> 04:30:13,200
It's not necessarily.

3295
04:30:13,200 --> 04:30:17,600
Okay, guys, I want to know that you guys
got this concept.

3296
04:30:17,600 --> 04:30:20,760
If not, let me know
so that I can explain it to you more

3297
04:30:26,120 --> 04:30:27,400
Oak Island and got it.

3298
04:30:27,400 --> 04:30:31,120
What about the rest?

3299
04:30:31,120 --> 04:30:34,800
Be very open to it because conflicts
you should be

3300
04:30:36,680 --> 04:30:40,800
very much clear about them.

3301
04:30:40,800 --> 04:30:41,880
I'm going to

3302
04:30:50,320 --> 04:30:50,880
help you guys.

3303
04:30:50,880 --> 04:30:54,000
So my question, I'll repeat it
and I'll repeat the solution

3304
04:30:54,000 --> 04:30:57,360
again.

3305
04:30:57,360 --> 04:30:57,960
Okay.

3306
04:30:57,960 --> 04:31:02,720
So we discussed that when there is a fast
forward, there will never be a conflict.

3307
04:31:02,720 --> 04:31:07,320
First of all, I want to ask you guys,
do you guys know what when a conflict, do

3308
04:31:07,400 --> 04:31:09,960
everyone understand that
when a conflict occurs,

3309
04:31:10,360 --> 04:31:13,760
if not, is let me know
so that I can also tell that because

3310
04:31:14,040 --> 04:31:17,280
I'm assuming that you know what's up
and when it happens.

3311
04:31:17,880 --> 04:31:22,880
If not, then we open about it.

3312
04:31:22,880 --> 04:31:25,040
Not it's not about the or.

3313
04:31:25,200 --> 04:31:33,520
It's about the lines that have changed.

3314
04:31:33,520 --> 04:31:37,320
So giving you a very crude example,
I'm going to give you a very crude

3315
04:31:37,320 --> 04:31:54,240
example of that.

3316
04:31:54,240 --> 04:31:56,360
So this is the example
that you were discussing.

3317
04:31:56,360 --> 04:31:58,160
This is the example
that we have in our code.

3318
04:31:58,160 --> 04:32:00,880
And I really want to show it
to you, all of you, so that

3319
04:32:01,880 --> 04:32:02,480
things become

3320
04:32:02,480 --> 04:32:23,880
very clear.

3321
04:32:23,880 --> 04:32:26,400
Okay, So this is the code that we had.

3322
04:32:26,400 --> 04:32:30,200
And I mean, what right
do you all agree that we have no planet

3323
04:32:30,200 --> 04:32:37,000
one planet two in the middle, but.

3324
04:32:37,000 --> 04:32:39,200
All right. Okay.

3325
04:32:39,240 --> 04:32:41,440
But we started working on planet One.

3326
04:32:41,760 --> 04:32:47,520
What we did added a Planet one
class, right?

3327
04:32:47,520 --> 04:32:51,800
We added our planet one class.

3328
04:32:51,800 --> 04:32:57,520
Okay, so it's like one class
existing anywhere else in the project.

3329
04:32:57,520 --> 04:33:02,520
Where have been,
you know, added some code into.

3330
04:33:02,520 --> 04:33:06,560
So is there any possibility
that, like, one is going to be having

3331
04:33:06,560 --> 04:33:09,720
any kinds of conflicts

3332
04:33:10,680 --> 04:33:14,000
now because no one else ever ruled on it.

3333
04:33:14,040 --> 04:33:17,480
Only one person wrote it on it. Right.

3334
04:33:17,480 --> 04:33:18,040
Okay.

3335
04:33:18,040 --> 04:33:21,400
Then the planet person who was working on

3336
04:33:21,480 --> 04:33:26,560
that one, he he entered some code
regarding Planet One online

3337
04:33:26,560 --> 04:33:35,640
and was celebrating a not right.

3338
04:33:35,640 --> 04:33:36,480
Okay.

3339
04:33:36,480 --> 04:33:39,960
Meanwhile, in parallel,
the Planet two person.

3340
04:33:40,560 --> 04:33:45,880
What he did is that he created
a class planet, you know.

3341
04:33:46,400 --> 04:33:51,880
So is there going to be a conflict
implied to Olivia? No.

3342
04:33:53,040 --> 04:33:54,960
And now when he

3343
04:33:54,960 --> 04:34:00,720
wrote down his code,
he added some good on 16 1789.

3344
04:34:00,720 --> 04:34:01,400
Right.

3345
04:34:01,400 --> 04:34:12,200
That's the scenario.

3346
04:34:12,200 --> 04:34:17,440
So at this point, all of you are with me.

3347
04:34:17,440 --> 04:34:18,200
Okay.

3348
04:34:18,360 --> 04:34:22,800
Now, when we did Fast Forward
was the first batch with the Planet One.

3349
04:34:23,040 --> 04:34:26,480
It simply overrode this code and placed it

3350
04:34:26,480 --> 04:34:27,560
over here

3351
04:34:29,760 --> 04:34:33,960
right.

3352
04:34:33,960 --> 04:34:34,800
Okay.

3353
04:34:35,200 --> 04:34:38,160
But when now we are merging,

3354
04:34:38,680 --> 04:34:41,760
let it do with the main.

3355
04:34:41,760 --> 04:34:44,680
It's going to say,
okay, now you know what?

3356
04:34:45,480 --> 04:34:47,480
Online number 16.

3357
04:34:47,480 --> 04:34:49,760
I'm like, I'm the one. I'm sorry.

3358
04:34:50,400 --> 04:34:52,240
So I'm busy online was 17.

3359
04:34:52,240 --> 04:34:56,440
You have added like one teacher,
but over here in London was 17.

3360
04:34:56,440 --> 04:34:59,280
You have like two
Priority is equal to New planet two.

3361
04:34:59,920 --> 04:35:01,880
Which one to Queen?

3362
04:35:01,880 --> 04:35:04,680
I don't know, because when you created

3363
04:35:04,680 --> 04:35:07,840
this planet to large,

3364
04:35:09,240 --> 04:35:11,200
you had nothing over here.

3365
04:35:11,200 --> 04:35:15,920
But when you are trying to merge it
that there is always some code.

3366
04:35:15,920 --> 04:35:17,040
Didn't know what to do.

3367
04:35:17,040 --> 04:35:19,480
I don't know what to do.

3368
04:35:19,920 --> 04:35:23,560
So now do you guys get it
crystal clear that

3369
04:35:23,600 --> 04:35:31,440
how a conflict occurs.

3370
04:35:31,440 --> 04:35:32,880
Not a theory, not crystal clear.

3371
04:35:32,880 --> 04:35:33,240
Come on.

3372
04:35:33,240 --> 04:35:39,040
That it should be done to c.

3373
04:35:39,360 --> 04:35:42,600
C c c is also for, like the emotions

3374
04:35:47,720 --> 04:35:48,080
only.

3375
04:35:48,080 --> 04:35:50,200
Like there will be a conflict.

3376
04:35:50,200 --> 04:35:52,680
Who who says that
that will do this matter?

3377
04:35:52,680 --> 04:35:55,160
There will be a conflict in me

3378
04:35:55,160 --> 04:35:59,160
who says that there will be a conflict.

3379
04:35:59,160 --> 04:36:01,960
Okay. MUHAMMAD That

3380
04:36:01,960 --> 04:36:03,800
anyone who says that, no, there

3381
04:36:03,800 --> 04:36:05,880
won't be a conflict

3382
04:36:09,760 --> 04:36:10,600
either.

3383
04:36:12,560 --> 04:36:13,280
Okay, guys.

3384
04:36:13,280 --> 04:36:17,160
So let's prepare for that.

3385
04:36:17,160 --> 04:36:19,800
We are the main branch.

3386
04:36:19,800 --> 04:36:21,480
We need to merge planet.

3387
04:36:21,480 --> 04:36:24,840
Q Right. Let me show you the intelligent

3388
04:36:27,040 --> 04:36:30,000
areas
how unemployment here does not exist.

3389
04:36:31,640 --> 04:36:34,080
So get merge

3390
04:36:35,240 --> 04:36:39,040
planet to

3391
04:36:47,840 --> 04:36:49,880
order merging

3392
04:36:50,640 --> 04:36:54,960
conflict, fix the conflict

3393
04:36:55,200 --> 04:36:58,840
and then come the result

3394
04:37:04,480 --> 04:37:06,000
very you know

3395
04:37:09,720 --> 04:37:12,240
now it's telling us that

3396
04:37:12,240 --> 04:37:14,360
this does your code

3397
04:37:15,480 --> 04:37:19,760
in this final come in
and this is the one that is coming from

3398
04:37:20,840 --> 04:37:23,720
the brass deck you are much

3399
04:37:23,720 --> 04:37:26,640
there's a clash between

3400
04:37:27,840 --> 04:37:28,280
value.

3401
04:37:28,280 --> 04:37:29,760
What do you

3402
04:37:30,960 --> 04:37:34,560
so what do you think we should tell it

3403
04:37:34,560 --> 04:37:39,720
to do?

3404
04:37:39,720 --> 04:37:40,960
Yes, exactly.

3405
04:37:40,960 --> 04:37:43,840
You'll sit in front

3406
04:37:45,880 --> 04:37:48,480
and exactly.

3407
04:37:48,480 --> 04:37:50,320
That's how

3408
04:37:50,400 --> 04:37:53,520
that's how beautifully do people

3409
04:37:53,880 --> 04:37:57,240
working on the big projects, same project,

3410
04:37:57,240 --> 04:38:00,360
can combine their codes using get cut.

3411
04:38:00,760 --> 04:38:03,960
So what exercises might be working
on one feature and the otherwise

3412
04:38:04,480 --> 04:38:05,320
another feature?

3413
04:38:05,320 --> 04:38:09,240
And when you merge that you can have

3414
04:38:10,600 --> 04:38:12,360
both the codes in your

3415
04:38:13,880 --> 04:38:22,680
project.

3416
04:38:22,680 --> 04:38:24,800
What are the visible victims of conflict?

3417
04:38:25,920 --> 04:38:28,040
Well, right. Next question.

3418
04:38:28,040 --> 04:38:30,640
That's why whenever you name
your variable, you name them

3419
04:38:30,680 --> 04:38:34,120
according to the use case, you do not use

3420
04:38:34,120 --> 04:38:37,480
ABC. TFT

3421
04:38:37,480 --> 04:38:41,920
Has is there any conflict of available
right now?

3422
04:38:41,920 --> 04:38:44,160
No. Right, because we named them

3423
04:38:45,120 --> 04:38:49,400
intelligence.

3424
04:38:49,400 --> 04:39:01,240
All what these concepts?

3425
04:39:01,240 --> 04:39:01,880
No, sorry.

3426
04:39:01,880 --> 04:39:04,840
They are not on slides, they are on

3427
04:39:04,840 --> 04:39:15,560
B care notes that are shared with you.

3428
04:39:15,560 --> 04:39:16,400
So it's not words.

3429
04:39:16,400 --> 04:39:18,440
We just use merge to combine the groups.

3430
04:39:19,280 --> 04:39:23,120
How did I give you the answer that

3431
04:39:23,920 --> 04:39:24,960
coming towards that?

3432
04:39:24,960 --> 04:39:26,040
Okay, I did one.

3433
04:39:26,040 --> 04:39:29,000
So this one are all of you here?

3434
04:39:30,560 --> 04:39:34,480
Yes. This
this is the last step is that you

3435
04:39:35,640 --> 04:39:37,040
just keep both going.

3436
04:39:37,040 --> 04:39:47,160
You just need this one.

3437
04:39:47,160 --> 04:39:52,240
Well I have slides,
but obviously not to the deal.

3438
04:39:52,240 --> 04:39:54,840
I'm honestly against slides
having too much information.

3439
04:39:54,840 --> 04:39:57,320
They are not good. They are not alike.

3440
04:39:57,320 --> 04:39:58,840
It's unethical for me.

3441
04:39:58,840 --> 04:40:01,200
It's unethical
to have slides with that much information.

3442
04:40:01,200 --> 04:40:04,600
It likely haunts me. So I have

3443
04:40:05,800 --> 04:40:09,000
very good notes for all of you
I share with you.

3444
04:40:09,000 --> 04:40:13,280
All of you and I have played
with these concepts to explain.

3445
04:40:13,320 --> 04:40:15,320
Okay, So don't worry about

3446
04:40:21,720 --> 04:40:23,920
okay guys,
don't worry about the slides for now.

3447
04:40:23,920 --> 04:40:29,640
We need to end this.

3448
04:40:29,640 --> 04:40:31,840
First of all,
let let's complete this right.

3449
04:40:31,840 --> 04:40:34,120
We have not yet finished. Come on.

3450
04:40:34,120 --> 04:40:34,680
What do you think?

3451
04:40:34,680 --> 04:40:38,160
We are finished now? Yes.

3452
04:40:38,160 --> 04:40:40,200
You fix your conflicts yourself.

3453
04:40:41,960 --> 04:40:42,680
Okay, guys.

3454
04:40:42,680 --> 04:40:48,840
So this one, all of you are with me.

3455
04:40:48,840 --> 04:40:51,480
Okay, Now

3456
04:40:51,480 --> 04:40:52,400
let me show you.

3457
04:40:52,400 --> 04:40:54,040
In the terminal,

3458
04:40:54,600 --> 04:40:57,280
we have resolved the conflict.

3459
04:40:57,280 --> 04:41:01,000
And now what's happening

3460
04:41:03,480 --> 04:41:09,920
is to look at this.

3461
04:41:09,920 --> 04:41:20,760
What do you see or hear?

3462
04:41:20,760 --> 04:41:23,040
Main slash merging.

3463
04:41:24,040 --> 04:41:28,720
It means that gate is waiting for you
to make the changes.

3464
04:41:28,720 --> 04:41:33,400
And then after that make a comment, merge

3465
04:41:40,520 --> 04:41:41,560
or merge to make.

3466
04:41:41,560 --> 04:41:43,800
Because right now we did what we did guys,

3467
04:41:44,720 --> 04:41:47,320
roommates, geniuses, right?

3468
04:41:47,520 --> 04:41:49,400
We added good goals

3469
04:41:49,400 --> 04:41:53,760
and this is somewhere
when you most something

3470
04:41:54,320 --> 04:41:57,000
get is not going to let you move
from that point

3471
04:41:57,480 --> 04:42:01,400
until you make the history,
until you make a comment.

3472
04:42:01,880 --> 04:42:04,160
It's not like let the movement ends.

3473
04:42:04,160 --> 04:42:06,080
You can do nothing on here.

3474
04:42:06,080 --> 04:42:08,240
You have to

3475
04:42:08,240 --> 04:42:14,040
you have to now make a comment.

3476
04:42:14,040 --> 04:42:15,680
So get

3477
04:42:17,640 --> 04:42:19,120
status,

3478
04:42:20,160 --> 04:42:22,400
get at DOT,

3479
04:42:23,760 --> 04:42:27,040
get comment that

3480
04:42:29,120 --> 04:42:31,200
the flat attacks

3481
04:42:31,200 --> 04:42:33,440
have been most

3482
04:42:33,960 --> 04:42:38,880
successful.

3483
04:42:38,880 --> 04:42:39,200
Okay?

3484
04:42:39,200 --> 04:42:43,320
After that, everything is all good.

3485
04:42:43,320 --> 04:42:49,560
We have made the most of it
and I should get more.

3486
04:42:49,560 --> 04:42:59,040
It's there.

3487
04:42:59,040 --> 04:42:59,320
Okay.

3488
04:42:59,320 --> 04:43:03,240
So now the last thing that I want to show
you is on simulation.

3489
04:43:03,240 --> 04:43:04,440
That's how it happened. So

3490
04:43:06,560 --> 04:43:09,800
and that it will be good to

3491
04:43:25,680 --> 04:43:26,400
we learn that

3492
04:43:26,400 --> 04:43:29,000
we should not merge directly
to the main branch.

3493
04:43:29,720 --> 04:43:33,080
Yes, but I'm the at it right.

3494
04:43:33,360 --> 04:43:38,920
So team is going to merge.

3495
04:43:38,920 --> 04:43:39,720
Okay.

3496
04:43:39,720 --> 04:43:43,280
But right now I'm just showing you

3497
04:43:43,320 --> 04:43:45,920
how you can merge using

3498
04:43:46,960 --> 04:43:48,280
your computers.

3499
04:43:48,280 --> 04:43:50,000
But this is not recommended.

3500
04:43:50,000 --> 04:43:52,720
I will teach you how to merge as a team.

3501
04:43:52,720 --> 04:43:57,240
We on github also in tomorrow's class.

3502
04:43:57,240 --> 04:44:00,360
Okay.

3503
04:44:00,360 --> 04:44:02,880
No one get to these interviews are over.

3504
04:44:03,320 --> 04:44:07,120
Tomorrow is going to be a review
you will spend all time practicing.

3505
04:44:07,680 --> 04:44:10,320
Okay so guys, we need to do this
simulation.

3506
04:44:11,000 --> 04:44:11,720
This is important.

3507
04:44:11,720 --> 04:44:18,080
We need to do this simulation.

3508
04:44:18,080 --> 04:44:18,480
Okay?

3509
04:44:18,480 --> 04:44:22,800
Now, when we have time to merge it
over here, let me just delete this

3510
04:44:22,880 --> 04:44:41,440
because it's creating a lot of confusion.

3511
04:44:41,440 --> 04:44:42,200
I thought,

3512
04:44:43,560 --> 04:44:44,360
okay, now and

3513
04:44:44,360 --> 04:44:47,360
we are going to make this here.

3514
04:44:47,360 --> 04:44:50,320
It's going to say no, fast forward

3515
04:44:51,960 --> 04:44:54,080
merger to other strategies,

3516
04:44:54,080 --> 04:44:58,920
but when we must mastered it,
found some fast close.

3517
04:44:58,920 --> 04:45:04,520
If conflicts would not have been there,
it would have easily adjusted.

3518
04:45:05,200 --> 04:45:09,160
But now as the conflict
is there, it's to now

3519
04:45:09,160 --> 04:45:12,000
see that make a new commit

3520
04:45:14,240 --> 04:45:17,400
which contains the infiltration of C5

3521
04:45:19,880 --> 04:45:22,240
merge that C6

3522
04:45:25,400 --> 04:45:30,040
and then C5 is going to point to that

3523
04:45:31,920 --> 04:45:46,080
is that all of you?

3524
04:45:46,080 --> 04:45:48,840
Okay, great. So now I am expecting that.

3525
04:45:49,680 --> 04:45:50,520
Okay, one more time.

3526
04:45:50,520 --> 04:46:05,880
So, so now.

3527
04:46:05,880 --> 04:46:08,240
Okay, so again,

3528
04:46:09,360 --> 04:46:12,080
I'm going to come to that too.

3529
04:46:12,480 --> 04:46:16,080
So now what we are doing is
we are merging C5 with C6.

3530
04:46:17,160 --> 04:46:19,480
If there's going to be no conflict,

3531
04:46:19,480 --> 04:46:22,040
it will simply merge them together.

3532
04:46:22,080 --> 04:46:25,800
But if there's going to be a conflict,
it will soon resolve

3533
04:46:25,800 --> 04:46:30,440
that conflict.

3534
04:46:30,440 --> 04:46:35,040
So that conflict is going to be resolved
in the sense that C5 six,

3535
04:46:35,040 --> 04:46:39,320
they both will be merge
and you will resolve the conflict.

3536
04:46:39,320 --> 04:46:43,600
Once that conflict is resolved,
your main grudge is going

3537
04:46:43,600 --> 04:46:47,880
to be pointing towards the code
which contains the combination.

3538
04:46:47,880 --> 04:46:50,000
C five and six.

3539
04:46:50,000 --> 04:46:52,680
I like the updated most

3540
04:46:52,680 --> 04:47:01,400
code.

3541
04:47:01,400 --> 04:47:03,600
Okay. Now coming to

3542
04:47:05,160 --> 04:47:07,280
this question, that letter

3543
04:47:08,400 --> 04:47:13,400
C six will be included in the history
are not well, that's none of our concern.

3544
04:47:13,480 --> 04:47:16,280
For now. There are different strategies.

3545
04:47:17,040 --> 04:47:20,480
If we use one, it may include this

3546
04:47:20,480 --> 04:47:24,400
kind of like C six and next week
if we use another, it may not.

3547
04:47:24,400 --> 04:47:27,920
But trust me, that is something
which is beyond the school blocks

3548
04:47:28,560 --> 04:47:29,960
you will be dealing with.

3549
04:47:29,960 --> 04:47:35,040
So Let's not go into that.

3550
04:47:35,040 --> 04:47:38,920
Yes, you are right about it.

3551
04:47:38,920 --> 04:47:41,880
Okay, guys, So

3552
04:47:43,320 --> 04:47:45,720
one more thing
that I would like to show you

3553
04:47:45,720 --> 04:47:49,840
pretty real quick here,
just to make sure that you have

3554
04:47:50,680 --> 04:47:53,080
your GitHub not,

3555
04:47:53,160 --> 04:47:56,560
you know, updated to this one.

3556
04:47:56,560 --> 04:48:01,920
And tomorrow
I'll show you how you can actually do this

3557
04:48:01,920 --> 04:48:07,200
merging stuff on GitHub as being a team B
because that is what I recommend you

3558
04:48:07,520 --> 04:48:11,880
that when you are working on projects,
what you don't need to resolve all you see

3559
04:48:12,560 --> 04:48:15,600
by writing the others code on the system,

3560
04:48:16,600 --> 04:48:18,240
maybe even merge the locally.

3561
04:48:18,240 --> 04:48:21,000
That's not one, maybe even do that.

3562
04:48:21,000 --> 04:48:25,240
But in your work this is most probably
the only merging on GitHub.

3563
04:48:25,240 --> 04:48:27,280
So I'll tell you how to build that.

3564
04:48:27,280 --> 04:48:32,240
Okay, so tomorrow, guys,
I'll make sure that we learn this.

3565
04:48:32,240 --> 04:48:35,320
And before this, let's we quickly show you

3566
04:48:35,320 --> 04:48:40,800
one repository,

3567
04:48:40,800 --> 04:48:43,880
the calculator, one
which you were discussing the update.

3568
04:48:44,080 --> 04:48:46,400
Now it's going to make sense
to all of you.

3569
04:48:47,480 --> 04:48:48,000
And I.

3570
04:48:48,000 --> 04:48:52,040
How many boxes do we have now?

3571
04:48:52,320 --> 04:48:55,960
You guys will get the idea
that why they are needed.

3572
04:48:56,640 --> 04:48:59,360
And if I show you any branch

3573
04:49:00,720 --> 04:49:03,080
that contains a lot of information

3574
04:49:03,080 --> 04:49:06,600
and if I go to pull request

3575
04:49:06,600 --> 04:49:08,280
but of the minor, we're going to try

3576
04:49:08,280 --> 04:49:12,200
trying to delete and and and unuseful.

3577
04:49:12,200 --> 04:49:18,080
So we call it like seriously increase
the branch to create delete a seven minus

3578
04:49:20,480 --> 04:49:22,840
description of the changes need

3579
04:49:22,840 --> 04:49:26,120
unuseful time a lot of times
and he has it with a smiley

3580
04:49:27,120 --> 04:49:30,040
updated function input list items in

3581
04:49:30,040 --> 04:49:33,880
for accessibility
fix primary display bars on that.

3582
04:49:33,920 --> 04:49:36,760
Now I know

3583
04:49:37,160 --> 04:49:40,680
all of them are there
and you get open this conversation.

3584
04:49:40,680 --> 04:49:44,440
We should avoid that using the number
formatting units like he's

3585
04:49:44,440 --> 04:49:46,760
giving everything in detail over

3586
04:49:48,480 --> 04:49:50,720
you know, there is like

3587
04:49:52,080 --> 04:49:53,640
there is a little party cleanup up.

3588
04:49:53,640 --> 04:49:55,800
We are
did not imagine but I would like to get it

3589
04:49:55,800 --> 04:49:59,080
my before I forget details
and stuff like this and as soon

3590
04:49:59,120 --> 04:50:03,400
you have professionals
where this is a microsoft calculator

3591
04:50:03,640 --> 04:50:06,200
on which people are working

3592
04:50:07,760 --> 04:50:09,920
so you know

3593
04:50:13,000 --> 04:50:13,600
this is how

3594
04:50:13,600 --> 04:50:20,400
professional works on GitHub.

3595
04:50:20,400 --> 04:50:24,520
And is this code public for people?

3596
04:50:24,920 --> 04:50:26,320
Yes, it's probably

3597
04:50:36,000 --> 04:50:40,000
this is particularly emerging code,

3598
04:50:40,400 --> 04:50:46,360
which languages
that do I don't understand.

3599
04:50:46,360 --> 04:50:48,760
Okay, guys. So

3600
04:50:51,760 --> 04:50:54,240
thank you all for the time

3601
04:50:54,240 --> 04:50:56,240
and you will be continuing for

3602
04:50:59,000 --> 04:51:04,280
here onwards tomorrow.

3603
04:51:04,280 --> 04:51:09,720
So make sure that you guys are advised
and you are trying to

3604
04:51:11,800 --> 04:51:13,080
conceptual here.

3605
04:51:13,080 --> 04:51:15,360
These are the slides.

3606
04:51:15,760 --> 04:51:17,880
I have the diagrams just,

3607
04:51:17,880 --> 04:51:24,000
you know,

3608
04:51:24,000 --> 04:51:26,720
the rest of the details will be in

3609
04:51:27,240 --> 04:51:41,760
notes.

3610
04:51:41,760 --> 04:51:49,160
Yes, you can copy

3611
04:51:50,240 --> 04:51:50,520
here.

3612
04:51:50,520 --> 04:51:53,280
I'll find the best to uploaded in about

3613
04:51:53,520 --> 04:52:01,040
one one or 2 hours.

3614
04:52:01,040 --> 04:52:03,680
Okay, guys, I'm pretty sleepy.

3615
04:52:04,160 --> 04:52:06,320
Take care. Bye bye.
