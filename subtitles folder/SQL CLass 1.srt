1
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,480
How did you highlighted on bottom

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,080
this one just just from your mouse cursor.

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,880
Tammy Now you need to install a
you need to watch the complete video

4
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:35,960
At the end of the video,
I have showed you how to fix this issue.

5
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:41,320
So today we will discuss what is database.

6
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,880
Why do we need the SD?

7
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:49,200
Well,
what are the select statements in school?

8
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,640
And we are closed in the school.

9
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,520
So before I can show you,

10
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:07,640
I have a question for you.

11
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,520
So you guys are already familiar with this

12
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,600
Web page, this web application, right?

13
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,000
So I have a question for you guys.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,520
Can you guys tell me

15
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,920
when you guys

16
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,920
enter something in this application?

17
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,880
So, for example, if you insert

18
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:41,120
any event card in here,

19
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,560
like for example,
if I click on add employee,

20
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,760
if I add this
that if I add something in here,

21
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,880
where did that that I'll go

22
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,960
Never seen it in my life.

23
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,960
I may or may not have grabbed my brain

24
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,120
from the last week

25
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,040
or let's say if I am let's see

26
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,280
click on employee list.

27
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:10,760
Yeah.

28
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:15,040
Do you guys have any idea
from where this data,

29
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,680
all of this
from where this data is being loaded

30
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,440
inside this page

31
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,480
to are remember some database

32
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,960
which syntax uses
some in back of this account.

33
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,000
We use something as a to store this data.

34
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,440
I mean,

35
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,800
I think we can easily store
this data in Excel file, right?

36
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,240
Maybe we can create a call
on my first name.

37
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,280
Last name.

38
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,720
And this job title implies status
and then put all that data in.

39
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,240
Next, an Excel logo. Do you guys think

40
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,280
there are tables in between?

41
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,760
We also have shields and rows
and columns in school,

42
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:11,800
right?

43
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,840
Have you guys working with large Excel
files?

44
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,920
The Excel files
that contain maybe vectors in millions?

45
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:30,840
Has anyone of you
working with those files?

46
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,000
Oh my God. That is a huge difference.

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,080
I look pretty right?

48
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,600
Oh, clearly worth all those efforts

49
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,920
from my, you know, almost.

50
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,040
Yes, of course.

51
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,160
In looking at your data, this

52
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,080
before, physically.

53
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,440
So have you guys ever worked with large

54
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,160
Excel files?

55
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,320
Woman is generally better in everything.

56
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,160
No, no, it's not.

57
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,680
Generally they
they are always better than everything,

58
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,280
Especially

59
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,480
the things that we men do that
they are best

60
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,600
almost too big Excel files.

61
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,200
Definitely.

62
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,360
As to your statement
about looking prettier.

63
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,880
So have you guys noticed that
if you try to load a bigger file

64
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,560
or if you try to open and manipulate

65
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,600
a bigger file,
sometimes Excel just stops responding.

66
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,320
Like for a minute it will not respond.

67
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,520
Or if you have to
just even just open that file,

68
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,320
it will take some time,

69
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,000
like five or 6 minutes maybe,
or sometimes it will just refuse

70
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,360
and it will say that the data is too much
and it cannot be stored

71
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,280
in a single file, cannot with loaded
load loaded in a single file.

72
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:58,760
Right.

73
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:04,120
Have you guys ever noticed that?

74
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,240
So yes.

75
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,440
Like we can store
this data in Excel file, but

76
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,800
Excel file has a limit.

77
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,720
If we
are dealing with large amounts of data,

78
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,520
we can not really use Excel files.

79
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,600
Plus,

80
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,760
yes, we can come up with a functionality
to connect

81
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,600
to that Excel file
with the website like this.

82
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,360
And this website
can fetch the data from Excel file,

83
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,000
but we will have to do a lot of effort

84
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,080
because sometimes,

85
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,640
let's say for example, right now
I am logged in as admin.

86
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,160
I see different

87
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,080
information.

88
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,760
If someone has logged
in, may be with another user

89
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,720
with less privileges you might not be able
to see maybe all of the data

90
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,200
or maybe may not be able to modify
all the data.

91
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,480
We have an alert due to word for

92
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,720
oh, because of that GitHub.

93
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,480
Oh, you guys will love this
word in school.

94
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,160
All right.

95
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,840
I'm so sorry for that. It's

96
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,960
but we will be putting a lot of time

97
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,720
this video in this course.

98
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,440
So sorry about that.

99
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:31,120
I have to use that bug.

100
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,480
So what databases are?

101
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,200
They are specialized software

102
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,800
to store the data

103
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,080
for your websites or your maybe

104
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,680
Android applications or iOS applications,

105
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:58,200
or you guys can also use to store the data
from your desktop application.

106
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,760
Yes, we can use Excel.

107
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,760
Yes, we can use Google sheets.

108
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,280
Yes, we can just throw this there dying
and not bad file.

109
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,600
We can just throw this
that bind folders or something like that.

110
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,240
But in the past 30 years,

111
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,920
software industry, they have come up

112
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,200
with the specialized software
just to store

113
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,640
manage, manipulate, connect

114
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,640
this that obviously your applications,
all types of applications

115
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,880
they can be a web application
like this one

116
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:37,400
there can be they they can be an Android
application or iOS application

117
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:42,600
or desktop application or whatever
type of software you guys have used.

118
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,800
And if that software,
especially those students

119
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,640
who have worked with payroll, softwares
or other kind of software

120
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,480
in which you guys create builds or

121
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,160
sell these or other type of desktop

122
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,840
databases can be used

123
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,840
to store audio and video as well,

124
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,360
but they are not generally used to store

125
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,120
that kind of data 90% of the time

126
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:16,080
it will be text based that meeting data
that we will be storing in databases.

127
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,960
But yes, they are capable of
storing audio, video, text

128
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,680
files, Excel files, any kind of backed out
that you might like to store.

129
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,000
But they are not that good

130
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,360
in those type
in handling those types of data.

131
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:38,480
So 99, 95% of the time, I will say
you guys will be using something.

132
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,240
You guys will be sporting
something like this nomadic or text

133
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,040
based that or maybe images that you put

134
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,680
with your profiles or things like that. So

135
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,240
so this is how it works on a very,

136
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,320
very high level
overview Are all this look and feel.

137
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,640
You guys are also familiar
with as an email a little bit of course

138
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,240
this alleged email, right how the website
are structured in your selenium pluses

139
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,360
you guys have noticed
we give ideas, classes and all that.

140
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,760
So in the email

141
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:19,680
it's like this if,
if I give an example from human body,

142
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,960
that email is similar
to our skeleton system.

143
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,480
The actual structure of that holds
everything together

144
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:32,960
the skin, the hair color
and every look and feel is

145
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,360
it comes from that course, that

146
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:42,840
beauty comes from that system,
that the behavior that you guys see on

147
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,520
your website is when you let's say,
for example, when you click on involves

148
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,640
if you enter something,
you get maybe a alert.

149
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,080
You guys are also familiar
with those alerts, right?

150
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:57,080
Inputting something,
maybe showing some warnings

151
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:01,600
or something like that,
or when you click on an entire

152
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,800
these fields and when you click on this
such a button or reset button,

153
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:08,560
all of this
behavior is coming from JavaScript.

154
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,560
Most probably from JavaScript
or something similar

155
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,280
that defines the front end of

156
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:19,480
of of a web application now.

157
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,920
But we also need a mechanism

158
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,280
to write all the rules, right?

159
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,600
Let's say, for example,
if you want to put a limitation

160
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,240
that imply name cannot be, let's
it won't be more than 20 characters, okay?

161
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:40,080
Or maybe the job title cannot be accounted
or it should be a content,

162
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,800
or it should be from this list

163
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,160
or all the business rules, right?

164
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,840
For example, when you show up on Amazon,

165
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,920
what kind of discount you will get,

166
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,160
how your credit card will be processed,
all those

167
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,760
that processing that logic,
those business rules

168
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,040
they are developed using

169
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,440
and other language may be Java, C++,
they are called the backend

170
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,280
language.

171
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,440
So CSS, SDM, HTML, JavaScript

172
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,640
to define the frontend
look and feel and the behavior

173
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,600
and other some kind of other programing
language might be

174
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:25,200
it might be B, C-sharp, Java, C++
to write all the business rules

175
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:31,120
and to connect to your frontend
with your back and with your database

176
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,320
so that all the data that you put

177
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,600
inside your website

178
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,640
next time you visit their website,
that data is there.

179
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:46,160
So we store that data
permanently in a desktop base

180
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,920
and that language that we use
to write the rules, business rules,

181
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,920
we use the same language
to connect this frontend

182
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,280
that you guys see and interact
with to that database.

183
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,520
So that when you click on this
such a button, it can pull the data

184
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,520
from database.

185
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:08,960
All this data is coming from a database
or if you have to add something,

186
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,640
that data is stored in a database.

187
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,680
Right now
you guys can think of a database,

188
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,240
just a very voice dictation software

189
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,200
that is very, very good exporting and

190
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,440
in fact storing

191
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,280
the data that
you guys want to store from your website,

192
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,440
also fetching that data
from that software.

193
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,360
So is there anyone who is confused,

194
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,720
who is unable to connect these dots,
or maybe who does not understand

195
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,320
how this front end works
at a very high level,

196
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,360
why we have this background of why
we why we need the database

197
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,040
or how this web application works? Yes.

198
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,840
And I'll tell you also looks good.

199
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,800
Just select this.

200
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,960
I will tell you later.

201
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,200
Keep it this this way and I will show you.

202
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,360
Look at what the

203
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,720
I mean, get ready.

204
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,560
So add button is somehow connected
with add to your Pascual.

205
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,080
Yes Aisha and Button takes the data

206
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,720
from these fields from here.

207
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,560
It combined this data with the duty.

208
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:40,400
And once that duty is executed, that
data is stored in the inside the database.

209
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,280
We will see how this

210
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,400
button is actually working
behind the scenes,

211
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,640
how that data got stored in a database,

212
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,280
what beauty is executed,

213
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:56,120
how we pull data
to how we push the data to database.

214
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,080
Database is online, correct?

215
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,080
Not local. It can be local.

216
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,520
It can be online.

217
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,760
Most of the dexerto applications
that you guys use,

218
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:10,920
they might have local databases
and online databases,

219
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,120
but the web applications
that they always have,

220
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,200
online databases.

221
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,280
So we were using a skill
without even knowing it.

222
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:26,520
Yes. Yes, you are right.

223
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:37,560
I show printing.

224
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,440
So let me tell you a little bit more about

225
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,400
databases so that you guys can see

226
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,480
a little bit more
how things work together.

227
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,320
Hello, everyone.

228
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,920
Sorry I am late.

229
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,600
Alexi is my call girl.

230
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,440
Have you fear?

231
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,000
Have you heard her? Good. Will died

232
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:08,520
so many was looking protocol.

233
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,760
So as we have a language.

234
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,240
Well, why do we need the Java language?

235
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:15,920
Guys?

236
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:27,320
What do we do with Java language?

237
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,400
Talk to a computer.

238
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:33,840
Same way we use school language

239
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,920
to talk to a database

240
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,400
API as we have Java language

241
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,760
to maybe tell your computer

242
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,040
with the help of Selenium framework
How to click on a browser.

243
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,120
We have this skill language

244
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,040
and with the help of this skill language,
we tell the database

245
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:02,160
If we need some data,
how to give us that special database

246
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,880
piece of data,
or if we want to store some data

247
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:10,240
or if we want to delete some debt,
or if we want to add some data

248
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:14,280
or anything that we want to do inside
big database.

249
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,840
We need we,
we need this skill language as good.

250
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,920
I didn't recognize you.

251
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:25,280
I thought I do another class.

252
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,600
Yes, you are right.

253
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,520
Only Java
languages using or we have more today

254
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:38,600
you guys will learn another language.

255
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:52,320
Yesterday you guys will be learning
another language.

256
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,960
So by the way, this school is short

257
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:00,240
for structured beauty language.

258
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,120
Then just a fancy to learn.

259
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,440
Don't don't worry about it

260
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,440
for short.

261
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:09,000
In the industry
we always, almost always use

262
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:13,120
school or sequel
whenever we need to stay in this

263
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,760
structured beauty language
except programing language.

264
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,440
Similar,
very similar to the programing language

265
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:25,000
that we use to manipulate the data

266
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:29,400
or to define some of the rules
inside that base

267
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,720
or to delete added modifier

268
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,640
or anything that we have to do
inside the database.

269
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,360
We use this language to tell that content

270
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,960
not being software, what do we want?

271
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,800
So it's short for structured
query language

272
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,680
and it is specifically designed

273
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,760
to communicate with the databases.

274
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,240
Java, we write Java code

275
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,560
to talk to computers,
to communicate with computers.

276
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,840
We use school to talk to databases.

277
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:12,000
We use it to manipulate the management
being databases to arms.

278
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,200
And as we have the rules for Java,

279
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,400
we also have rules for school.

280
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:24,280
But the rules for schools are very,
very flexible.

281
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,480
They are not that strict
like we have in Java.

282
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,160
Then they are very, very flexible.

283
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,880
If in databases,

284
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,400
if you are not using the proper syntax

285
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,880
or you are not using the proper semantics,

286
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,800
most probably you will get wrong data,

287
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,600
but you will not get an error
or something like that.

288
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,440
While we were learning Cucumber
as to find a cool

289
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,120
contract, it's

290
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,680
yes, I like the
I am about to sign a cool contract

291
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:04,880
so hopefully everything
will be good again.

292
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,160
Married once again.

293
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,160
You guys please give me some motivation.

294
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:14,480
Can you guys please tell me that
everything will be fine?

295
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,320
I am really scared.

296
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:24,920
Never.

297
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,000
Everything will be fine.

298
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,640
Yes. I might be getting married soon.

299
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,320
Everything will be super fine.

300
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:39,240
Let's say dream you, Atelier 14.

301
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,320
It's.

302
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,280
Yes, I am a good as well.

303
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,280
But I am not sure about how
my wife will treat me.

304
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,720
Do it.

305
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,400
It will be easy

306
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:55,680
from that.

307
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,720
I would not.

308
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,560
It would not be your own life.

309
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,800
Oh my God.

310
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:06,360
Maybe I want to run
into a different country or something,

311
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:10,040
but I am already trapped.

312
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,200
And I just realize when it comes

313
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,760
to getting married, for
especially for boys, like, for example,

314
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,720
my mother told me in their past
that I need this, this, this suit

315
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,400
and I need these these shoes
and I need this jewelry and all that.

316
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,640
My father told me I need this,
this sister, they have their own list.

317
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,480
We need this, this, this.

318
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,320
I am the only one who is spending
and nobody cares about me.

319
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,720
And now I have
to buy so many things for be

320
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,040
easy will pick it up you

321
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:44,160
if you will wash your computer.

322
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,640
If you. By the way,
she is also a developer.

323
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,680
She is doing her
master's in computer science as well.

324
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,400
I hope we will have something in common.

325
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,640
Maybe she will support you guys
instead of me.

326
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:01,880
Sometimes, but

327
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:09,280
then you will be programed.

328
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,800
Thank you guys.

329
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,960
Then sit and program your own life.

330
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,800
You will get so many others new.

331
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,720
Will talk if health conditions,

332
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,520
if I when I see let it be.

333
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,360
But I am really concerned.

334
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,840
I am scared for the babies, by the way.

335
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,920
My my babies, they will be coding
and then they will be five or six.

336
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,240
I hope so.

337
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:43,280
Learn to negotiate with 1 to 3 ratio
for happy life or I already have told her

338
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,280
that how much pocket money
she will She should expect from me

339
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,080
and all the
gifts that she I will be buying from her.

340
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,520
It will be from her pocket money.

341
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,960
So you have made some agreements already

342
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,640
and conditions

343
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,320
one day there, one dollars

344
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,200
pocket money gone from her account.

345
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,080
All right,
guys, let's get back to the class.

346
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,800
So as we have rules for Java,

347
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,640
we also have rules for school.

348
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,960
And we will be learning all those rules

349
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:30,360
in this course.

350
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:35,040
So you guys already know
all about the debt or the information.

351
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:42,080
So usually when things are organized,
they are plastic instead of data.

352
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,400
We use this term information

353
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,600
or facts or records of information.

354
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,720
So if you throw just a random data
inside a folder

355
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,200
or inside a file,
we refer to that as the data.

356
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,640
But if you put everything organized,
everything is easy.

357
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,560
Everything has a meaning assigned to it.

358
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,400
We refer to it as information,
facts on records.

359
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,960
So databases,
they are very, very organized.

360
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,560
We have papers, we have columns and rows.

361
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,280
All the tables
are connected to each other.

362
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,840
So we will be referring to that thing

363
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:27,480
as most of the time information,
usually as records of data.

364
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,520
You should see the woman in the slide

365
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:35,560
showing terms and conditions here.

366
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:39,240
Oh my God, I am it

367
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:44,800
a sign for me,
no matter how much money a girl.

368
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,040
Because after her marriage is worth money.

369
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,800
Her money? Yes. The man.

370
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,680
Is he already cooperative?

371
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,400
These are these.

372
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:58,200
Leave this index to the life picture.

373
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,240
Harmony is harmony
and has learned the money also How

374
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,920
we poor man What we can do.

375
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,040
You already signed even if you don't know

376
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,280
not only money, it is everything. Yes.

377
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,400
So then what we can say?

378
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:20,920
Can you please let me repeat Zema Mr..

379
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:27,040
So let me repeat Zuma All the money
that you have is is not yours.

380
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,280
It's Silver's money as well.

381
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,960
But the money that Sylvia had
is her money.

382
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,400
It's not your money.

383
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,080
This will be a very zema.

384
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,600
We don't see any comment from you

385
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,320
to pass that or I

386
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,240
beware for for

387
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:56,400
Look, you can only show to my husband

388
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:01,160
the storage systems.

389
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:07,640
So there are so many types of databases.

390
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,080
So whichever

391
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:14,440
system
you are using to store that information,

392
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,120
we call them storage systems.

393
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,400
And if they are allowing the users

394
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,080
to keep, organize and manage that data,

395
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:32,000
we call them as the database systems,
and they are not that simple.

396
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,920
They are very, very complex systems.

397
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,920
And we actually they are that complex that

398
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,520
in industries

399
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,120
we have is separate role.

400
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,480
We have a separate team
just to manage databases,

401
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,320
a separate job, just to manage database

402
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,760
so you guys

403
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,120
can just have a job by.

404
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,560
Just let me ask you.

405
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:02,640
Well, if you learned the proper
way, separate teams and separate

406
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:07,280
separate IP rules, they are called
a DB is just to manage the databases.

407
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:12,720
They are that much complex, that huge.

408
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,120
And you guys will be in fact,
you guys will be interacting with those.

409
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:20,600
DB A lot.

410
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:25,400
So these are some of the examples
of the yes.

411
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,640
DB As they are called.

412
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:36,040
DB As database administrators, best

413
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,800
Buddy, we are thinking about woman here.

414
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:56,440
So almost all the big companies,
they have their own databases,

415
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,160
Microsoft, IBM, Oracle,

416
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:04,800
and we also have the open
source databases.

417
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,240
Thank you. Silva So

418
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,560
by the way, this Microsoft access
that yes,

419
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:14,880
there is a firebase and I have actually
worked a lot with that firebase.

420
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,200
So if you guys know about the access,

421
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,040
I think I have it on my computer.

422
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:27,120
So it comes with this
a suite of Microsoft applications

423
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,640
when you install office or something.

424
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,480
So this is how

425
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,640
you guys can imagine
how our database looks.

426
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:42,040
It looks like very, very similar to Excel.

427
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:47,960
So we have columns in here
and then we can start inserting the data

428
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,760
inside these rules.

429
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:59,040
For example, any anything
that may be numbers or maybe you want to

430
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:04,760
insert to be named

431
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,200
or something like that,
all of the text related

432
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,680
or numeric that that that you want.

433
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,240
So this is how a table will look like.

434
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,400
It will have columns and rows
just like Excel choose,

435
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,640
and then you can give access
to this table.

436
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,200
Maybe, let's say

437
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,480
only a two or three employers
will be having access to this table.

438
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:30,520
Not everyone will be having access
in your component of this table, because

439
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:35,760
sometimes these tables, they can contain
very, very sensitive information.

440
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,840
For example, salaries of the employees,
credit card pins

441
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,600
or passwords or usernames.

442
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:48,400
So in companies and there will be a lot of
tables inside the databases,

443
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,920
but all the employees will

444
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:56,560
only be having access to those tables
which are related to their job.

445
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,520
So DBAs will be restricting
your access to those papers.

446
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:07,200
So this functionality is also provided
by that database software.

447
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:11,040
Let's say, for example,
if you want to give access

448
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:15,440
to a specific table or record or a column,
you can also do that.

449
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,640
How about my BSP, my skill?

450
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,080
Is it one of the tools?

451
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:24,760
Yes, it is one of the tools that you can
use to interact with the database.

452
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,000
Yes, BHP, my SBA.

453
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:27,960
So I'm

454
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,400
so this is the Microsoft access

455
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,880
that that I have written in here,
this Microsoft Excel.

456
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,800
It is ideal for small,

457
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,720
small and mid-sized businesses,
to be honest in the industry.

458
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,080
I have never seen this Microsoft access

459
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,480
being used as a database

460
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:56,200
system,
but this skill server, it's widely used.

461
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:00,480
Can you show again what do you do by
highlighting at the beginning in school?

462
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,920
I missed that part and that's will.

463
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:05,440
I will be showing all those steps again
under don't don't worry

464
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,080
when we will be writing the code.

465
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,120
I will or I'll be walking you through

466
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,200
all those steps is school
and of my school are different?

467
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,520
Yes, they are different.

468
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,000
So if something like that

469
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,480
school is a standard, school is a standard

470
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,080
in which we have defined all the rules

471
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,480
that how to write.

472
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:36,120
You re how to store the that line
and all those syntax,

473
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:41,000
all the semantic rules
and then all the company

474
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:45,280
like Microsoft, IBM, Oracle
or any other company in the world

475
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,240
that want to build a database system,

476
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,120
they follow this school standard

477
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,720
so that you guys, as the end users,

478
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,200
you don't have to learn, let's say,
a different language

479
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,520
if you are using the database
from Microsoft, a different language,

480
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,800
if you are using the database
from, let's say,

481
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:08,440
IBM, a different language,
if you are using a database from Oracle.

482
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:15,200
So this is actually the standard
that they are all agreed on.

483
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:20,840
But still companies,
they make teeny tiny details in syntax

484
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,560
and in semantics here and there.

485
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,240
So I will I will tell you
what are those differences?

486
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,000
And we will teach you to database
databases.

487
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,480
Actually, the database from Oracle

488
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:35,480
and the database
from this open source database.

489
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,480
Then that is called my ask you.

490
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:41,640
So we will be teaching you this to back
that basis so that you guys have an idea

491
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:45,280
what things can be different from database
or back to base.

492
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,400
But I think 90% of the time

493
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,720
all the
companies, they follow this standard.

494
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:56,880
So you guys will not be needing
to learn too much details.

495
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,960
If you want to switch
to a different database,

496
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,720
let's say if you get a job
and they are using Sybase,

497
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,480
so you don't need to completely

498
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,800
relearn all the syntax and semantics.

499
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,600
Maybe 5% or 34%.

500
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,400
You guys have to.

501
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,840
So in class we will be covering my school.

502
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,640
So my school is the open source

503
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,680
database are developed by community.

504
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,600
It's free.

505
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:31,120
Everyone can use it this
this database freely.

506
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,880
But this Oracle one is the paid one.

507
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,800
And we will also be looking
at this database.

508
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,840
And these are
some of the famous databases and

509
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,440
they are all ideal for mid-sized

510
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:49,600
businesses, are ideal for midsize
large size

511
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,200
by large size,
most probably in the industry.

512
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,960
You guys either
will be working with Oracle

513
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:58,920
or my

514
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:02,880
school or sometimes this SQL Server, IBM,
these three are the famous ones.

515
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,200
Newbies are just names of those

516
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,520
and database softwares
that these companies have developed.

517
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,960
This SQL Server is from Microsoft.

518
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,200
My school is open source
and this Oracle is from Oracle.

519
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:19,560
Nice.

520
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:26,040
They have polyphonic.

521
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:30,360
So every application,
every website or desktop application,

522
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:36,920
mobile application, they have bookings,
frontend and backend backend

523
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:41,040
to contain all the rules and the databases

524
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,560
frontend contain all the look and feel

525
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,360
and you guys will be hearing
this term guide.

526
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,040
It is short form graphical user interface

527
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,000
and this is what you guys see
and interact with.

528
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,120
Back end is where
all the data and tools are stored.

529
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,280
So what what as a tester
we will be needing as a tester,

530
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:12,200
you guys will be verifying the frontend
and the backend.

531
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,920
So for example,

532
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:19,160
sometimes what happens is that

533
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,840
using selenium and all that you guys

534
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,840
might try to test cases
and when you put some information in here,

535
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:31,040
it might happen
that it forces all the rules.

536
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,320
But When you click on this and the button
maybe,

537
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,280
maybe that data is not stored
in the database.

538
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,960
So next time
you will not be able to find it.

539
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:44,840
So you will insert the data from here
inside this field

540
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:48,680
and you will you will save this data

541
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:52,440
by clicking on the save button
or some kind of similar button.

542
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Then you will go to that base.

543
00:34:55,920 --> 00:35:00,120
You will write a duty
to fetch the exact same information

544
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:03,120
that you have entered in here
and then you will match it.

545
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:09,360
If all the data has been saved correctly
in the correct table

546
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:12,920
or not, there can be so many mistakes
that developer can make.

547
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,440
Maybe they are splitting this data
in a different table

548
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,160
and they were supposed to store
in a different table.

549
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:23,360
Maybe they are only storing
first name, supervisor, name or ID,

550
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,960
or maybe they are not storing in status
or sub unit

551
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,880
so they can when they write these rules
and then when program do the applications,

552
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,240
they can make so many mistakes.

553
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:38,000
So as a tester, you guys will make sure
that not only frontend

554
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,840
is working perfectly fine, but all also
the back end is also working fine.

555
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,120
By the way,
there are two separate job roles.

556
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:50,640
Usually either you guys will work as
a backend tester or as a front and tester.

557
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:55,120
Till now you guys have been learning
different and testing from today.

558
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,000
You guys will be learning
how to perform backend testing.

559
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,960
This is the skill class next to the API.

560
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,000
API is also a part
of the backend testing. So

561
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,200
and so now you guys can apply

562
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,560
on two jobs at the front and tester
and a back and better.

563
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,120
So it will be a totally different story
from now on.

564
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,880
And you guys will actually be full

565
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,760
spec testers
as we have full spec development.

566
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,760
So after taking these two courses,
you guys will be full spec,

567
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,480
best of which can test back end
as well as frontend.

568
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:33,320
But on jobs you will be
most probably you will be testing

569
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:42,440
either the frontend or the backend.

570
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:47,560
So the title of the IP professionals

571
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,440
that set up which one is easy,

572
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,320
frontline frontend is easy,
backend is hard.

573
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,880
Finally, I am saying something is hard.

574
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,960
Title of the IT professionals

575
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,800
who install and maintain everything

576
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,200
related to databases they are called

577
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,240
IS database administrators button job.

578
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,120
Keep silence that you can do both. Yep.

579
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,240
And then if you will,
you will be very good.

580
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,240
Soon you will be manager or director
or something like that.

581
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,520
If you have this mentality,
if you know how to sell yourself,

582
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:30,520
how to, how to allow companies

583
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:34,320
to utilize your next crazy sign,
if that is not

584
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:40,600
going to save us.

585
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,760
So you would need
we have separate computers to store this

586
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,480
frontend and the rules

587
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,960
and yeah.

588
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,160
Yes madam, this is correct.

589
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:57,280
Frontend is sometimes it looks very,
very different.

590
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,480
How backend is working.

591
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,640
So these databases,
they are usually stored

592
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,800
on separate computers
and those two computers

593
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:12,240
which are exploding the frontend
and all those rules,

594
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,240
they are connected with these computers.

595
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,560
Which horse, these databases

596
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,240
are, Any questions still always.

597
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:33,400
Are things making sense?

598
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,280
What is the function of ideas?

599
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,200
I'll use this all the time.

600
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,600
Slowly

601
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,560
I shall please pick up the pace.

602
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,160
I think it's just 1.5 months or so

603
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,880
and you guys are ready for the jobs.

604
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,360
With five years of experience.

605
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,760
It will make more sense
when we start doing it.

606
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:59,400
Yep, yep, yep. It's

607
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:04,520
okay. So

608
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,440
databases are also thumbs

609
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,120
in different varieties.

610
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:19,360
Some of them are called
relational databases.

611
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:24,240
So the data that we stored in tables,

612
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,400
they are these tables,
they are also connected to each other

613
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,880
and they have some kind of relationship

614
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,320
with each other.

615
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,600
And the databases
which have this type of structure,

616
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:44,280
these tables and all are rows and columns.

617
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,600
They are called relational databases.

618
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,840
Later on, I have to tell you an example,
and it will make more sense.

619
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,520
And there are other types of databases,
as Damir

620
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:00,400
said,
that Firebase is a database from Google.

621
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,200
It does not have tables.

622
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:07,560
It stores the data
in the form of developers or documents.

623
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,240
Firebase

624
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,000
is a real time database

625
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,080
that has fired stored as well
that five stored.

626
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:20,280
It actually stores
the data in the form of documents.

627
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:24,160
So for us to take our time
tied to document and then we stored

628
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:29,040
that data inside Firebase but
we will not be learning those databases.

629
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:33,120
They are called non relational databases.

630
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,760
We will be learning
the relational database is only

631
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,120
because they are the databases
which are widely used.

632
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,600
Slowly, Industry is moving towards

633
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,400
the non relational databases, but

634
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:51,000
because they lack something very basic
and not all

635
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,640
the applications can be transferred
to non relational database.

636
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:59,640
You just said database
20 times 21 country to

637
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,360
fetch select and database.

638
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,760
You guys will hear these words
so many times.

639
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,960
Okay,
so our DB and message again is short form

640
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:17,080
for relational database management system.

641
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:20,320
And if this system, if

642
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:25,160
this is the special category
of databases that

643
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:30,440
work on the principle
that each table has a key field

644
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,200
that uniquely identifies each role

645
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:41,800
and that these is can be used to connect
to one table to another table

646
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:51,960
supporting
still important things in here. Yes.

647
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,720
So those databases

648
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:59,720
which have these papers and these tables

649
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,640
which are connected to each other,

650
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:07,440
with the help of these keys,
I will show you in a very great detail

651
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:12,600
how it will can be connected
with other table and what are these keys,

652
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,520
these special type of databases.

653
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,200
They are called IBM's,

654
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,680
and we will specifically be discussing
these type of

655
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,440
I have walking job interviews
with five year old tester

656
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,560
and I realize that I know
most of the answers.

657
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:33,360
I thought, I don't know anything,
No one, you guys.

658
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,240
So we will be preparing you
for the interviews as well.

659
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,640
But you guys are done with all the courses

660
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:41,800
we will prepare.

661
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,560
Your resume is

662
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,320
we will teach you how to do an interview

663
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:51,080
and we will be hosting separate sessions

664
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:54,120
for each course for Java as well,

665
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,680
Selenium and all those separate classes

666
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,520
to prepare you for interviews

667
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,040
after that, after taking those

668
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:05,320
sessions, believe me,

669
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:10,400
you guys will be much,
much more prepared than an actual person

670
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,320
who is actually working
for the last five years

671
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,440
because usually what happens in the jobs,
let's say,

672
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:23,160
if company is being benefited, let's say
a company has hired you for something

673
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:27,200
and your job is just to, let's say,
fill an Excel file.

674
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:33,520
And if companies business is growing,
if you fill that Excel file on time,

675
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:39,000
believe me, they don't bother if you know
anything else or they don't bother.

676
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
If you are learning anything on jobs
or not, they will just keep on saying

677
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,920
to you that, Please keep filling
those Excel files on time

678
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:51,120
because that's what is required
for the business to do so.

679
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:54,160
But when you guys will be preparing,
we will be preparing you.

680
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:57,920
We will be preparing you
as the overall person who has actually

681
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:03,360
worked in 3 to 4 different companies,
have used multiple tools and all that.

682
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:07,280
So you guys will always be more prepared
than those actual persons.

683
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,600
I will prepare.

684
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,840
I will keep learning new things

685
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,880
in order. Just start somewhere.

686
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:19,000
So if you have this attitude or not,
you guys will be

687
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:23,560
one of those
who become directors or managers

688
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,640
or go to those top positions

689
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,240
as well.

690
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,880
Let me check if you're a woman. Change.

691
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,280
Do you mean shall

692
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:39,600
I please show number three in fingers?

693
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,400
This is the number to be done, man. This

694
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:46,720
you are okay.

695
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:47,880
Perfect.

696
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,480
We will build a fake

697
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,720
you Universal specialist

698
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,400
that number three.

699
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,640
Soon I will be needing that number three.

700
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:02,960
Maybe next week.

701
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,880
So basics of databases

702
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:11,040
Database is a collection of papers

703
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,680
we stored in that timely form of papers

704
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,440
and when you are hired.

705
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,560
So maybe the collection of tables.

706
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:28,560
Tables in database consist of rows
and columns just just like Excel files.

707
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,960
And that old sorry that told me that

708
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,880
a little change of terminology

709
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:41,080
rows in the DB,
they are called red bar records or tuples.

710
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,480
Sometimes

711
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:45,920
columns in the

712
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,360
DB called fields and Attributes.

713
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:54,360
So those columns are
sometimes called fields or attributes.

714
00:45:54,360 --> 00:46:05,480
And the role rows, they are
sometimes called tuples or red cards.

715
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:09,320
And so because there can be so many tables

716
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:13,360
in a database, sometimes

717
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,600
to understand
the overall picture of a database,

718
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,440
we build this kind of picture
and this kind of picture is called

719
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,880
it has a special name,
it is called Schema.

720
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:31,880
So in this picture, this is a table,

721
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,200
this is another table,
This is another table.

722
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:38,040
And you guys will notice
that there are some lines

723
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:41,040
which are being drawn
from one table to another.

724
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,440
Table is DV connections.

725
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,800
No, no. This is a schema of a database

726
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,600
and they are just telling you that

727
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:56,280
what are the names of columns
in this table?

728
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:59,880
So this is the date of birth.

729
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,680
This is the name relationship.

730
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,440
This is the relationship type,
use name and all that.

731
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:07,440
So the name of the columns

732
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,520
that you have in your table,

733
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:13,480
plus this arrow that shows you

734
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:17,080
which other table this table is connected

735
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,520
and how to out of these tables
I will show you.

736
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,560
Can you zoom a little bit?

737
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:23,880
I think it is a screenshot.

738
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:27,840
You can check
if I can if I can share this with you

739
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:33,720
guys, copy.

740
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,160
I hope it will allow me.

741
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:52,120
No, I'm
going to download this picture from here.

742
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,240
It's okay. We will have this presentation.

743
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:58,320
Actually, I will share this picture
separately as well.

744
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:01,440
Let me check actually
if I have that on my computer, give me

745
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:09,320
let's do

746
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:18,160
a rescue, please.

747
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:28,760
No, that's okay.

748
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:29,880
We will have to select.

749
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:34,600
Yes, you guys will be having those slides.

750
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:37,440
So a new term,

751
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,200
the term is called

752
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:42,840
database schema.

753
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:47,280
And what this database schema is, it's a

754
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,680
kind of graph.

755
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:53,320
It's a kind of picture that shows you

756
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:55,880
overall

757
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,960
about overall about the tables

758
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:03,680
that you have in a database
and the relationships.

759
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:07,920
And each this vertical column,
which actually contains

760
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,760
the names of the columns in that table.

761
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,240
And these arrows

762
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:16,840
there, shows the relationship
with this primary key and foreign key.

763
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,800
They are the columns

764
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,840
based on which these two tables

765
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:25,400
are connected, and I will show you how
they are connected.

766
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:26,280
We need to

767
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:36,760
so let's say we have a table

768
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,800
in which we are storing the employee

769
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,800
first name status supervisor name.

770
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:48,720
So are there chances, guys,
that this record

771
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:55,480
then have duplicate values? Yes.

772
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,040
So to avoid that duplication,

773
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:03,720
we always, always use a special column

774
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:07,680
in all the tables and we call it ID

775
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:11,400
and we make sure that the I.D.

776
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:16,440
is something that can uniquely identify
two records.

777
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,920
It's like the SSN, two persons.

778
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:25,120
They can have same names, but not all
persons can have same SSN number.

779
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,320
So similarly,

780
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:31,560
when we store some data in a table,

781
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:34,640
we always, always

782
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,440
try to have a column

783
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:41,360
that always contains something is unique

784
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:45,480
that we can use to refer to a special row.

785
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,360
And in databases.

786
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:52,760
That special column
is called Primary District.

787
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,080
We call it the primary key.

788
00:50:55,080 --> 00:51:02,400
So why we have the primary key
so that if there are two same records,

789
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,400
we still have a piece of information

790
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,000
that can help us to uniquely

791
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,160
identify and record unity.

792
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:16,440
So that's why we always create this IDs.

793
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:19,800
So you see it in here. And if you

794
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,280
guys execute the

795
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:27,440
security, select all from person,
you will see this I.D.

796
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:29,640
column here that's not in here.

797
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:32,760
The idea is they are simple numbers.

798
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,600
Each time we insert

799
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:38,160
a new record
and new number is inserted in here

800
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:42,000
and we can use that number to uniquely

801
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,080
identify that.

802
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:48,400
So for example, in here
or actually the city is different, but

803
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:53,000
even if the city is same, we can identify
this little with this number 15

804
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:56,000
and this road with the number 14,

805
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:00,840
so that we never have that ambiguity,
never have that duplication.

806
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:02,280
Does it make sense?

807
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:03,840
You guys need the primary key.

808
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:13,840
Why? We have it.

809
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:16,120
So the theme is written in here.

810
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,840
Every table

811
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:22,640
in that database will have a primary key,

812
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:29,240
unique identifier, unique column

813
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:34,680
to refer to Special rule No Special column

814
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:38,400
to refer to.

815
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,880
All the rules are uniquely

816
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,120
possible.

817
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:46,080
So let me repeat it again.

818
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:49,320
Every table in database.

819
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:54,440
So overall,
we first have a database inside database.

820
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:56,400
We have tables.

821
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,520
Inside tables, we have rows and columns.

822
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,760
So what is primary key?

823
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,440
Primary key is a special column

824
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:09,360
that contains the unique numbers,
all the letters or sometimes

825
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:12,640
combination of both that we can use

826
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,120
to uniquely identify all the rows

827
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:20,840
from that table.

828
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:24,440
So primary for short, we use the can be

829
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,960
instead of primary, you would say, Peter.

830
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:32,040
So primary is a column

831
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,640
in the table

832
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:39,920
that uniquely identifies e red card

833
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,920
and the value is never,

834
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:46,560
never duplicate or empty.

835
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:50,040
So all the rules that we insert

836
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,920
for this special column,

837
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:56,320
they will always have a value.

838
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:59,160
They cannot be empty, null or

839
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,360
a left

840
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:05,640
on inserted.

841
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:09,080
So similar to week
it cannot contain null values.

842
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:12,080
So inside this table

843
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:14,840
be reminded me of Ahmed Hawn's movie.

844
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:17,040
So person I.D.

845
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,640
in here we are calling it
the person I usually

846
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:24,000
usually in databases, in tables.

847
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,720
We usually put this I.B.

848
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:30,000
word with the column

849
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,760
that we are using as primary.

850
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,760
We can use any column as the primary key.

851
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,720
We just propel the database.

852
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:39,720
That database.

853
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:42,880
Nick This column,
I will be using this column

854
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:47,080
as the primary,
so the database will know how to like

855
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:50,120
which column I need to treat,

856
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:57,560
especially as the primary.

857
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:01,320
So you guys understand
the purpose of the primary key

858
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:06,400
this new terms like primary

859
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,440
and then

860
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:12,560
null value.

861
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:15,640
So null in databases is used when we

862
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:19,000
do not have anything inside.

863
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,760
And so for

864
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:26,880
example, if

865
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,320
I open the Excel

866
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:36,000
line, maybe I can show you from database,
you see there's

867
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:40,040
this null, null null
written in here, null.

868
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:42,840
It means no value is inserted

869
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:48,560
for this vab
and date of birth column for this row.

870
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:51,320
These rules no values inserted so

871
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:55,600
database insert in null value.

872
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:01,560
When we do not insert anything inside
this inside the column.

873
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:05,160
When we insert a complete row of

874
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:13,920
okay so so many Newton's

875
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,960
school, we what is that skill base?

876
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,560
Is it a programing language

877
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:23,520
or a software or a standard

878
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:39,800
or what is this as well? Yes.

879
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:43,080
If suspend or there's a standard for

880
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,960
a, for the language that we use to

881
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:50,520
store or manipulate data
inside a database.

882
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:54,040
Right. And what what is the database

883
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,320
And that nothing

884
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,040
special question Two ladies VMs

885
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,680
if files in this system

886
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:17,280
are not actually

887
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:22,560
if not a file in the system,
I'm asking about the impact of this.

888
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:28,320
What is in database is
it is some kind of software

889
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:33,680
or is it
there's some kind of programing language

890
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:37,960
or is it some kind of other thing
collection of data

891
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:44,560
in terms of papers? Yes.

892
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:48,640
So it's a piece of software that explores

893
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:51,360
the data in the form of tables.

894
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:56,200
And all these tables,
they have rows and columns,

895
00:57:56,520 --> 00:58:00,120
and we stored in that
in a special structure

896
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,560
and that special structure

897
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:08,320
that our bases are called on B, B and Ms..

898
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:12,160
Indeed, special type of databases.

899
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:15,240
We have tables and tables

900
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:19,960
have some kind of relationship
with each of them.

901
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:21,480
Okay.

902
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:24,240
And what is a schema, guys?

903
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:27,400
What is a schema?

904
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:43,720
What is a database schema?

905
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:47,400
Yes, it's a kind of visual information

906
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,320
about the tables and their relationship

907
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:56,160
with each other
that a database like this one

908
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:01,120
is. And

909
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:06,480
what is the primary key presentation?

910
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:16,200
How tables are linked to each other.

911
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:20,040
You need to write

912
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:23,400
a special column

913
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:27,320
that help us uniquely identify

914
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:31,320
a row inside

915
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:34,920
a table.

916
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:36,960
Yes, Yes.

917
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:40,640
All all right.

918
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:44,720
Well, do you guys have some questions

919
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:45,560
or. Everything?

920
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:46,680
Looks good.

921
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:51,680
Special column that I'd be donating.

922
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:53,840
Those would be most

923
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:09,000
birds.

924
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:13,680
And I know I adore.

925
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:16,760
What is the role for and what is column?

926
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:19,120
Yes, most of all, you see.

927
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:22,000
So this is a table

928
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,520
in here.

929
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:28,760
So for example, this column is ID first
name, last name, gender, ACP.

930
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:31,280
So if you go

931
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:33,960
to this human resource,

932
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:37,200
can you guys tell me

933
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:40,000
what will be the column names?

934
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,960
If I create a table for this page,

935
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:47,520
which of this will be table name,

936
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:51,840
which one of them will be column names,

937
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:56,160
and what kind of things will go inside

938
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:58,120
the rows

939
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:01,720
from this page?

940
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:04,720
Identify the table.
What do you guys think?

941
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:08,360
If you guys design, if you guys are asked

942
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:12,960
to design a database table for this page,

943
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,800
what will be the name of the table

944
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:31,880
so the

945
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:35,280
you guys can call this table
as the implied information.

946
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,280
Everyone agrees

947
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:40,480
that we can create the table employ
information

948
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:45,040
to store the data from this table.

949
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:48,880
Okay, identify the primary E

950
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,480
first, tell me the column names.

951
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,040
What should be the column names?

952
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:57,480
If I have to define a table

953
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:11,040
for this information,
what do you guys think?

954
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:14,560
So do we use this information
as the column names

955
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:20,120
for this table?

956
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:21,000
Right?

957
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:24,360
So for if we are creating a table

958
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:28,120
for this page, this will be the table name

959
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:32,600
and these will be the columns

960
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:35,720
of the

961
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:38,760
tell me out of these columns,

962
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:45,200
which one should I use as the primary?

963
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:46,360
I'd be right.

964
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:51,720
This one
and this one I can use as primary.

965
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:53,600
And what will be the rule?

966
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:55,640
Well, what will the rows contain?

967
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:58,440
What will rows contain inside this table?

968
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:08,800
What will those contain?

969
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:11,040
All this data.

970
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:12,760
All this data.

971
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,520
This will be stored.

972
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:18,120
I b this will be first name,
last name title.

973
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:19,120
I need to.

974
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:22,520
Moustafa is it clear how Well,

975
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:26,880
what are rows and columns
in a database table?

976
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:30,720
Is there anyone who can still who cannot
still think

977
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,840
how a web page can be?

978
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:37,760
How information from one page
can be converted to a table?

979
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,480
Why it all, says Suhail. The best

980
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:52,480
is okay,

981
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:58,000
we will change it to batch 11 is the best
You one.

982
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,520
Once you guys know the school, you guys
will be able to change this information.

983
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:08,160
Whatever you guys want.

984
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:11,400
Okay, so now you guys know

985
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:15,600
how information

986
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:18,600
can be stored

987
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:23,280
in the form of a table inside

988
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:27,280
a database, right?

989
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,800
Okay, let's let's do one more example.

990
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:52,520
So that is the.

991
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:55,400
Okay, so let's say

992
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:58,080
I want to create a table

993
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:01,200
for this page.

994
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:06,560
Identify
the table name for this page. Yes.

995
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:10,320
After this, we will be having a break.

996
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:14,680
So leave list will be in the table name

997
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,440
identified the column names

998
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:34,720
all the fields.

999
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:35,400
Right.

1000
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:41,520
Do you guys know we actually have
the exact same tables in the database?

1001
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:42,720
Exact same tables.

1002
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,320
Open up your my skill workbench

1003
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:51,000
and click on this.

1004
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:54,200
So you should see this syntax item,
underscore

1005
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,680
my circular below
that you should see tables

1006
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:59,920
in here and an arrow expand

1007
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:05,960
this arrow in here.

1008
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:13,320
Do you guys see
all the table names inside the database?

1009
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:16,280
This is the actually actually,
this is the same database

1010
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:17,400
that is connected to that.

1011
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,760
That implication

1012
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:23,320
because I am adamant right now.

1013
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:25,200
That's why I see more stuff.

1014
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:29,040
I have access to all the tables.

1015
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:33,480
These are the exact same table tables
that are being used for that website

1016
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:40,240
as the backend.

1017
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:50,120
And let me tell you something interesting.

1018
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:52,040
So you see this,

1019
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:55,720
I did 2068 for air, so hell the best.

1020
01:06:57,080 --> 01:07:00,960
Let me copy this information in here

1021
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:14,320
guys.

1022
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:18,200
Then you
guys guessed the name of the table

1023
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:22,000
that might have this information.

1024
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:23,640
This imply information.

1025
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:27,400
Go through all these tables
and tell me which table you guys think

1026
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:47,760
then have that implied information.

1027
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:50,200
I cannot see this table in my ask you a

1028
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:56,680
massive videos.

1029
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:58,320
Do you see this

1030
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:02,880
this icon of database and return
and this syntax item

1031
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:05,640
under my screen here

1032
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:21,440
and do you guys see this table asset
at job employed

1033
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:27,720
or asset that DOT employs? Yes.

1034
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:30,920
You guys will be having fewer tables
because I am the admin.

1035
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:32,760
I have access to all the tables.

1036
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:37,400
But do you guys I don't want to describe
this database by your hands.

1037
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:47,160
That's
why I have given you limited access.

1038
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:51,840
But you guys should have this asset
that implies.

1039
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:52,680
So let me show you.

1040
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:54,280
What does this table contain?

1041
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:56,920
So a tool
to check out what the table contains.

1042
01:08:56,920 --> 01:09:01,800
We like to select start from asset

1043
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:08,200
at job

1044
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:11,200
implies.

1045
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:12,760
Okay. Like this.

1046
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:13,400
Right.

1047
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:58,080
And this utilize and execute this query.

1048
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:01,120
You guys see this employ
number employ only

1049
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:06,960
when you write asset select

1050
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:09,400
start from asset that implies.

1051
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:13,880
Now don't worry about the syntax
just right.

1052
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:14,920
We're

1053
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:18,880
employ

1054
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:22,040
I d is equal to

1055
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:27,120
and can you guys guess what

1056
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:30,440
information I will get
if I write employ ID

1057
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:34,200
is equal to and this I'd be

1058
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:36,000
deciding from the front end

1059
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,440
this this me so hell the best
then you guys.

1060
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:46,480
That's what I would probably get.

1061
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:51,000
I get the exact same

1062
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:55,080
information on bosses
to hell, the best date of birth

1063
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:59,160
and all those blah blah blah blah.

1064
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:02,840
So this is how we try to query
to fetch the data from backend

1065
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:04,960
so that this is how it is

1066
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:10,400
in the outlook's from the frontend.

1067
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:14,520
So now before going on to the break,
your task is to insert

1068
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:18,960
some data
from the frontend in here, in here

1069
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:24,040
and then modify the security
so that you guys can see

1070
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:27,120
the same information from this database

1071
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:36,240
inside of this table.

1072
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:37,120
Okay.

1073
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:40,560
Your task is to insert

1074
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:43,960
some data
from the frontend in here inside this page

1075
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:48,040
and then modify this query

1076
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:50,440
so that you guys see your data in here

1077
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:55,440
when you execute degree.

1078
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:58,280
Is there anyone who is confused
about the task

1079
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:01,080
or the task is not

1080
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:09,720
after I type the

1081
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:12,600
how did you get
so the best on the lower part

1082
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:17,720
in any you don't work this
okay now so next page will be overloaded.

1083
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:21,000
Oh by the way guys, please
don't even start doing that too much data,

1084
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:23,040
okay?

1085
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:33,320
Please don't destroy my poor database.

1086
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:36,440
But oh, by the way,

1087
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:43,200
this is how we write comments,
Write a theory

1088
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:46,280
or platform,

1089
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:49,680
modified the list below.

1090
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:52,200
You agree to

1091
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:57,960
fetch the data that you insert from

1092
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:10,080
frontend.

1093
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:18,920
Next will be enough for the break.

1094
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:19,200
Okay.

1095
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:29,960
Let's have a break for 15 minutes.

1096
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:31,400
Okay. Please come back.

1097
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:33,520
Is a single or double code full?

1098
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:35,880
If not, what do we

1099
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:39,120
some of the questions
then don't support it.

1100
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:44,320
But this my school,
if it supports the single course

1101
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:47,880
as well as the double course
of the Oracle one it does not support.

1102
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:49,960
I will tell you the differences later on,

1103
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:52,560
but right now you guys can use
both of them.

1104
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:55,920
It will be it will be a good practice
if you can use the single course,

1105
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:59,880
because it will work on
almost all the databases.

1106
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:02,520
Okay. Not don't use the double quotes.

1107
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:06,840
Let let's learn of the best
best practices.

1108
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:08,520
Can you repeat task one more time?

1109
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:10,400
And it is written in here.

1110
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:22,280
This is the task, not worry.

1111
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:25,800
It is just simply if you want to execute.

1112
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:28,560
Let's say you have written so many queries

1113
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:32,840
and let's say
you only want to execute a specified query

1114
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:37,600
so you can select back like this
and you can execute that specific query.

1115
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:40,960
Now all of the queries
will not be executed from this page.

1116
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:43,280
Only discovery will be executed.

1117
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:46,920
If you want to execute this one,
you can only select this one.

1118
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:49,640
Or are you going to execute this one?

1119
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:59,760
This is what you mean
by highlighting things.

1120
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:04,440
Is there anyone who is still not clear
about the task?

1121
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:06,840
I forgot. What do I do?

1122
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:09,760
It's not showing a post in this portion of

1123
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:15,640
or stand up from your chair,
have some dance

1124
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:20,520
beads, some fresh here
and then post in the sport.

1125
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:22,520
And I did. You did the dance already?

1126
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:30,640
It's still not working.

1127
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:32,040
Many dance

1128
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:37,840
and you do get some kind of added or

1129
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:42,280
for guys

1130
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:47,040
you guys are already as good
champions throws

1131
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:50,480
we don't need to learn anything
about skill

1132
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:57,960
in the new year

1133
01:15:58,040 --> 01:16:00,240
because you are not executing the activity

1134
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:02,360
selected.

1135
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:06,280
Give slide this query like this
and then press this button in here

1136
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:13,840
posting this sport channel

1137
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:17,200
if you guys face any issue and please

1138
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:20,200
be back 1210

1139
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:31,520
other guys, see you in 15 minutes.

1140
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:35,160
And don't forget to remind me
about recording

1141
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:47,640
and the sub unit is developer

1142
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:50,640
start game later and sales human resource

1143
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:56,640
include current employees only.

1144
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:59,080
Now I should click on add

1145
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:02,760
base.

1146
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:06,160
I'm not familiar with this application.

1147
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:12,040
Yes. Is it inserted?

1148
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:14,960
Not inserted

1149
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:25,320
in? Should I insert the information here?

1150
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:26,840
I like

1151
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:44,040
for why changing my name?

1152
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:50,280
Is there a bug in this website?

1153
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:51,280
A lot

1154
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:56,360
of. Okay.

1155
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:57,000
All right.

1156
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:00,120
Let let me copy this ID

1157
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:01,680
so this.

1158
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:15,360
Oh we can right.

1159
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:19,200
And if I click on sale, will it work

1160
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:25,320
so successfully.

1161
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:27,760
That's why I have copied this

1162
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:30,880
employed I from here.

1163
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:33,360
And if I can get in here

1164
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:41,800
sometimes it takes a

1165
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:46,280
bugs there for us to find them.

1166
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:49,600
Here we see right information
that we inserted

1167
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:53,600
from front that.

1168
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:54,240
All right.

1169
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:58,080
So this is how this frontend backend
and tables and database

1170
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:03,480
are all connected.

1171
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:04,800
So you guys cannot change that.

1172
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:10,200
You guys don't have the access to this
to do this one.

1173
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:15,480
So let's, let's,
let's learn the rules for this skill

1174
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:19,560
so that you guys can fetch data

1175
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:24,360
from these tables, from this database.

1176
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:25,320
Should we.

1177
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:36,400
Are you guys ready?

1178
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:40,080
All right, so

1179
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:45,120
I will feed you

1180
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:49,240
about this foreign key later on.

1181
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:51,480
Here are some rules.

1182
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:55,360
So ask your is case insensitive?

1183
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:56,880
Okay.

1184
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,240
Uppercase and lowercase things

1185
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:03,760
they are same in squirrel,

1186
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:06,040
but some of the databases

1187
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:10,200
they are they do not support this feature.

1188
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:13,560
For example, the Oracle database.

1189
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:17,520
It is so sensitive in some of the areas.

1190
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:21,720
This my skill
when it is almost case insensitive in

1191
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:25,160
everywhere. The

1192
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:28,480
the queries

1193
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:32,160
that we use to fetch the data
from the database.

1194
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:37,240
This left from this keyword
select keyword.

1195
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:40,960
And we also have keywords
like update or delete insert.

1196
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:44,320
They are the same keyword as we have in
Java as we have

1197
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:47,360
class final Abstract.

1198
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:48,760
All those reserved.

1199
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:52,640
However, they are also reserved
the keyword for school.

1200
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:58,080
So using these keywords
we construct ambiguities

1201
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:01,360
and feel good.

1202
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:05,480
They also end with semicolons
as the Java ones.

1203
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:09,960
How we connect my sequel to website
by using log in and pass.

1204
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:11,520
Alex We will.

1205
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:14,760
I will also teach you
how to connect your applications

1206
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:16,800
to database in the last class.

1207
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:20,760
We will also learn that

1208
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:25,480
semicolon is standard way
to separate school statements.

1209
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:28,880
If you delete from school,
it will be deleted from application

1210
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:31,160
Yes, I show.

1211
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:36,200
But companies in real life,
they have backup databases.

1212
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:39,400
They have backup tables as well.

1213
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:44,840
So but still, we have not given you
the delete permission

1214
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:50,120
because I know
you guys will just remove everything

1215
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:53,880
from the start of this
so you guys don't have to remove access.

1216
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:57,040
I only have to remove x,
but I will teach you how to do that.

1217
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:59,480
Actually,
I should teach you how to do that.

1218
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:03,840
You guys will destroy the databases
as well in the companies,

1219
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:09,000
but I will teach you on a test database.

1220
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:13,200
So as a tester
we mostly use select statement

1221
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:16,200
to extract

1222
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:20,120
select specific data from the database.

1223
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:20,640
Okay.

1224
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:24,840
So the first beauty that we will learn

1225
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:31,760
from,
so we don't have to know that you guys

1226
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:35,240
actually should not know that.

1227
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:39,960
But I will show you
sometimes you might need.

1228
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:42,920
Yes, the databases are big,
goes for the haircuts

1229
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:45,440
because this is where
all the information is stored,

1230
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:49,800
all those credit card numbers, things,

1231
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:52,800
their balances, usernames, passwords.

1232
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:56,760
This is where it is all stored
if your backup is compromised.

1233
01:22:56,840 --> 01:23:00,960
That said, the hackers, they don't have
to do anything with your application.

1234
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:02,520
They have the database.

1235
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:10,160
They have all the data.

1236
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:12,480
So this is the very simple, simple
hello world.

1237
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:17,160
The syntax that as you guys made
that helloworld in Java,

1238
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:20,520
this is the hello world of ask you.

1239
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:23,160
So we use this

1240
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:28,440
this reserved keyword select.

1241
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:32,400
And after they select
we specify the column name

1242
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:35,280
from which we want.

1243
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:38,640
I want the data.

1244
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:43,520
Yes, these are the protocols
that you guys should follow.

1245
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:49,200
If you get fired or delete their database,
you should.

1246
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:50,480
You can actually.

1247
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:54,920
But all the companies,
they kind of have always these backups.

1248
01:23:56,280 --> 01:23:56,880
They always

1249
01:23:56,880 --> 01:24:04,120
have backups.

1250
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:06,600
So this is this is a reserved keyword.

1251
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:11,080
You guys can type
this keyword in uppercase or lowercase

1252
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:14,040
or mix up it some of uppercase,
some lowercase.

1253
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:14,680
It will work.

1254
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:18,040
In any case, no issues.

1255
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:21,120
Then we specify the name of the column.

1256
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:24,640
So let's say, for example,
if a table have 15 columns

1257
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:29,400
and you want to get to that now, let's say
maybe from one column or two columns,

1258
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:32,640
you can specify those columns in here.

1259
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:36,440
Then this from again, it is old keyword

1260
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:40,680
and after the different,
we specify the table name.

1261
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:44,520
So if I ask you

1262
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:55,400
if I ask you,

1263
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:58,320
I have this table

1264
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:01,440
person

1265
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:05,160
inside this database,
can you guys write it?

1266
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:09,520
You need to just refer to the first name
from this table.

1267
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:12,200
Can you guys Google type activity
and send it to me?

1268
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:14,880
I want all the rules.

1269
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:18,400
Mark The columns should to be firstname.

1270
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:20,280
This person name of

1271
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:29,160
by the way,
we can also use the hash symbol

1272
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:34,440
for comments.

1273
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:35,760
So this is the good effect.

1274
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:41,720
All the first names from Busan,
this table.

1275
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:42,480
This is your task.

1276
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:43,720
But I take you

1277
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:47,120
to fetch all the first names from persons
table

1278
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:51,240
from persons stable.

1279
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:53,800
I shall please grow up.

1280
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:56,120
You are about to leave syntax.

1281
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:59,360
It's not from as such implied

1282
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:06,000
small persons.

1283
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,440
Everyone is about 20 years old.

1284
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:15,240
I still maybe eight years old
or nine years old.

1285
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:17,320
I'm just thinking of you guys.

1286
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:25,880
I love your.

1287
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:27,400
Why are you picking on Asia?

1288
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:28,720
Because I don't mind.

1289
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:31,280
Oh, Maryam, you want to be in big game.

1290
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:32,640
Okay, let's.

1291
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:34,320
From now on, Maryam will be. You

1292
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:36,600
do it.

1293
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:41,000
It's so.

1294
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:44,840
I will write the select statement

1295
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:48,400
right after this.

1296
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:52,440
Select statement we specify the column

1297
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:56,280
from which we want to fetch the data.

1298
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:58,640
So what is the column name?

1299
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:03,680
Can you tell me the column name?

1300
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:05,160
It's the first name.

1301
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:09,840
Do I need to type it exactly
the same as it is displayed in here?

1302
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:11,200
Uppercase. First name?

1303
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:14,600
Or is squirrel not so sensitive?

1304
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:18,360
So I can write anything.

1305
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:23,120
I can write first,
I can write capital, MN and anything.

1306
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:25,600
Okay. It is not case sensitive.

1307
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:29,760
So select first statement and I can also
do the same with this select.

1308
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:33,240
Maybe some of it, uppercase
some of the lower obvious,

1309
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:37,040
but a good skill
developer will write these

1310
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:39,400
without keyboard in all uppercase

1311
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:43,080
and the column names

1312
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:46,880
same as the

1313
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:49,720
entire table.

1314
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:51,840
A good developer.

1315
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:53,840
Okay, so once

1316
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:57,680
you have specified
this is this is how we make comments

1317
01:27:58,160 --> 01:28:08,160
using the hash signs
or using these underscores.

1318
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:13,720
So once you have specified the start
I will tell you

1319
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:18,120
what does this statement is very
the start of means that the fetch

1320
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:20,760
all the columns start
means that all the columns

1321
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:23,000
here.

1322
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:28,200
So after specifying the column name,
we again write

1323
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:32,720
the next result keyword which is from
so it's it's very similar to English

1324
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:37,520
we are saying here
database select this column from

1325
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:40,480
and then we specify the table name.

1326
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:44,400
That's simple English select
first name from this table.

1327
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:54,760
And if I execute this duty.

1328
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:58,960
So I see all the first names in here,
all the first names,

1329
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:04,640
and you guys also see the same.

1330
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:10,800
So then it is saying, why not write a star
instead of first name?

1331
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:15,120
So then it's right now
these are simple toy tables.

1332
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:18,960
In real life, you will be having a table
that may contain

1333
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:22,680
150 columns, 200 columns, 300 columns.

1334
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:25,360
If you write star, all

1335
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:28,640
your query will take a

1336
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:34,880
long, long time to fetch all data
from all the columns and all the rows.

1337
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:37,400
So we never, ever write

1338
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:41,640
this all unless and until you understand

1339
01:29:41,640 --> 01:29:45,200
what you are doing.

1340
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:49,400
Okay, Because this query
is being executed on a server

1341
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:51,720
which is right now located in,

1342
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:55,000
I don't know, in the United States
or maybe in Russia.

1343
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:55,440
I don't know.

1344
01:29:55,440 --> 01:30:00,400
We are on the list and it is all
the data is traveling on the Internet.

1345
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:04,880
If you fetch unnecessary data
that you don't,

1346
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:08,240
you your application will be super,
super slow.

1347
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:10,520
Your processing time will increase.

1348
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:13,200
So we always, always write what we need.

1349
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:16,800
But for the learning purpose
we might use the static

1350
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:20,680
stop symbol a lot,
but in practice we should never

1351
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:24,440
nor start

1352
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:27,280
means all the columns, not all the tables.

1353
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:28,360
We'll get the

1354
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:31,960
but yes.

1355
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:35,680
So right now I have only told you

1356
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:39,400
how to filter out column names.

1357
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:42,240
Later on I will also repeat you
how to filter rules.

1358
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:43,480
Right now.

1359
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:47,000
You'll see all the rules later on.

1360
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:52,160
I will teach you how to even some rules
that you are interested in.

1361
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:57,640
Instead of selecting all the rows.

1362
01:30:57,640 --> 01:30:59,880
Okay, So

1363
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:09,240
if we have to get the data
from two tables,

1364
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,360
can you guys guess what will be the syntax

1365
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:26,760
now please post in the sports channel.

1366
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:30,760
Use and use. And

1367
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:36,680
so and it is used for a different purpose
in here we use

1368
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:40,240
we separate the column names from like

1369
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:46,040
so if I write last name.

1370
01:31:46,040 --> 01:31:48,920
So right now
I'm using a comma to separate out

1371
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:55,280
separate of multiple clients.

1372
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:56,480
Actually, let me,

1373
01:31:58,360 --> 01:32:00,360
I will share all of these curious,

1374
01:32:00,360 --> 01:32:03,360
but I want every one of you to follow me.

1375
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:08,200
So if I write a first name for my

1376
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:13,320
last name, then I see first name
and the last name in the output.

1377
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:23,800
You guys also see
two columns in the output.

1378
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:30,360
Friend.

1379
01:32:30,360 --> 01:32:34,960
Okay guys, then write acuity
to your first name, last name, gender,

1380
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:39,640
age and city
and send me the fact of first name,

1381
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:58,200
last name, gender, age and city.

1382
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:02,960
Does school execute
only the last word by default,

1383
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:08,160
it executes the line that your
that you put your cursor on.

1384
01:33:08,440 --> 01:33:12,400
But let's say if you want to execute this
one, you can select and execute this one.

1385
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:14,400
If you want to use this select,

1386
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:17,040
you want to go to this one, select
and execute this one.

1387
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:21,520
If you want to use, execute
this one, select and execute.

1388
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:23,600
So this is how we do it.

1389
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:26,840
Select that unit
that you want to execute and then

1390
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:32,560
click on Execute Button.

1391
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:33,840
Okay.

1392
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:37,920
So if we want to build that from

1393
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:41,840
gender

1394
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:46,280
ID and City,

1395
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:50,880
we separate out these column names

1396
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:57,960
and then we will see that to.

1397
01:33:57,960 --> 01:34:02,960
Is there anyone who is unable
to see the same results

1398
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:11,000
that I see in here?

1399
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,360
All would

1400
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:16,800
is there anyone who is confused

1401
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:23,280
or if there is anyone who don't understand
what is going on?

1402
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:28,200
Skill is literally very,
very easy as compared to Java or

1403
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:36,400
something like that.

1404
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:41,920
Select first and limit to zero hundred
add up or knowing that number be selected.

1405
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:48,840
So if you guys see this error,
that means you need to execute this

1406
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:52,560
first line at the
now you are getting this error.

1407
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:55,200
So let me explain

1408
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:57,520
on a single server

1409
01:34:57,520 --> 01:35:00,320
where you can have thousands of databases

1410
01:35:01,160 --> 01:35:05,800
and when we write a query,
we need to specify

1411
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:09,200
on which database we want to execute.

1412
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:10,440
The security.

1413
01:35:10,440 --> 01:35:14,840
So this use means that for all the duties

1414
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:17,120
that I will be writing below this line,

1415
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:22,080
all the UDC
should be executed on this database.

1416
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:23,600
So you,

1417
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:27,680
those who bought this add other you have
and you need to select this command

1418
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:31,680
and you need to execute this at the manner
you need to do this.

1419
01:35:31,680 --> 01:35:40,320
After that, you will not get any entries.

1420
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:44,520
So you guys see in here
on the left side on this server,

1421
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:48,920
we have three databases
there is this database passed to syntax

1422
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:51,600
underscore sequel.

1423
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:56,520
There is a syntax item underscore school
and there is this system on the database.

1424
01:35:57,240 --> 01:36:01,520
So right now we need to tell our database.

1425
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:04,680
We need to ask you all to fetch

1426
01:36:04,680 --> 01:36:06,800
the data from this database.

1427
01:36:08,080 --> 01:36:10,600
That's why we need to execute this Good.

1428
01:36:12,120 --> 01:36:14,080
Yes. Because you guys don't have access.

1429
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:17,280
You will see only one database again,

1430
01:36:17,320 --> 01:36:20,400
you guys know the reason

1431
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:27,120
this.

1432
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:32,520
Okay? Yes.

1433
01:36:32,640 --> 01:36:37,080
I said you guys will not see
those two options.

1434
01:36:37,080 --> 01:36:40,800
These are system tables and they contain
very sensitive information.

1435
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:42,880
Actually,
you can delete the complete database

1436
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:47,360
if you have the access to these tables.

1437
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:50,480
And you guys know the reason
why you guys don't see those tables.

1438
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:52,760
Even if you Google,

1439
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:56,560
you will not be able to do that
because you have not shared password with

1440
01:36:58,320 --> 01:37:02,200
it. Okay.

1441
01:37:02,200 --> 01:37:07,920
And if I have to fetch the data
from all the columns of a table

1442
01:37:08,360 --> 01:37:23,160
can you guys tell me the query for that?

1443
01:37:23,160 --> 01:37:32,520
If I have to fetch the data
from all the columns, here's the

1444
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:35,840
select

1445
01:37:37,080 --> 01:37:40,680
all or static and then from

1446
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:45,560
for only the reserved keyword
and then the personal data.

1447
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:58,600
But right.

1448
01:37:58,600 --> 01:38:01,040
And now I see the data from

1449
01:38:02,440 --> 01:38:09,880
all the columns.

1450
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:11,920
Okay, Almost all good.

1451
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:15,160
Should I proceed to the next thing? So

1452
01:38:16,280 --> 01:38:21,400
easy peasy.

1453
01:38:21,400 --> 01:38:25,480
Okay, so if we say select

1454
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:32,800
the first name,

1455
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:36,520
most of I will tell you
what does this weird mean?

1456
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:49,520
You just give me a few minutes.

1457
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:52,520
So if we do that from first name,

1458
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:58,840
let me execute this duty.

1459
01:38:58,840 --> 01:39:04,040
So you guys will notice
that there is a lot of duplicate data.

1460
01:39:04,040 --> 01:39:11,080
Do you guys see
the duplication in the data?

1461
01:39:11,080 --> 01:39:22,640
So if we do not want this duplication,
there is a result.

1462
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:26,240
Again, it is old keyword that we can use

1463
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:29,040
to avoid duplicate data.

1464
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:32,040
Can you guys guess the data?

1465
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:36,280
Can you guess the name?

1466
01:39:36,280 --> 01:39:40,200
Well, what can being a result
give to avoid duplication?

1467
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:41,760
Unique

1468
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:44,480
and distinct?

1469
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:46,000
Remove Remove

1470
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:52,800
so unique gives.

1471
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:56,440
Yes, it's a keyword,
but it is used for a different purpose.

1472
01:39:56,680 --> 01:39:58,920
Why you guys are saying delete Myriam.

1473
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:00,640
If I want to remove.

1474
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:03,320
If I don't want duplicates, you should.

1475
01:40:03,320 --> 01:40:06,160
I deleted them
permanently from the database.

1476
01:40:07,120 --> 01:40:09,320
And you see, that's
why you guys don't have access.

1477
01:40:09,320 --> 01:40:12,520
Because delete is the
that will actually delete all the data.

1478
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:15,000
So even if you guys are trying
to fetch the

1479
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:18,400
unique data, you will still deliver

1480
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:21,440
the data.

1481
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:24,600
Yes. The keyword is distinct, right?

1482
01:40:24,720 --> 01:40:28,680
Or distinct Before the first name

1483
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:31,120
and immediately

1484
01:40:31,120 --> 01:40:33,560
and again try to find the data and see

1485
01:40:33,560 --> 01:40:35,680
if that removes the duplicate

1486
01:40:36,920 --> 01:40:39,360
data from your

1487
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:45,560
desired site.

1488
01:40:45,560 --> 01:40:49,080
Mohammad It does not matter
if it is the first one or the second one

1489
01:40:49,080 --> 01:41:03,840
because they are same.

1490
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:04,200
Okay.

1491
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:07,240
Okay.

1492
01:41:07,240 --> 01:41:11,040
And if if we have,

1493
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:15,640
let's say two columns, let's say a select

1494
01:41:17,080 --> 01:41:19,800
first name,
I want every one of you to follow me.

1495
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:24,280
If we have first name, last name

1496
01:41:24,360 --> 01:41:28,800
from person,

1497
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:31,440
let's say I am selecting the data
from two columns

1498
01:41:34,200 --> 01:41:39,200
and again, I have duplicate data, right?

1499
01:41:39,280 --> 01:41:43,160
You see the duplicate data
even when we try to select the first name

1500
01:41:43,160 --> 01:41:48,280
and the last name. Yes.

1501
01:41:48,280 --> 01:41:51,760
Then is actually this software,
this my skill workbench.

1502
01:41:52,280 --> 01:41:55,480
It is the most pathetic software

1503
01:41:55,520 --> 01:42:00,000
that you can ever use
to write skill queries, but it is free.

1504
01:42:00,840 --> 01:42:03,120
That's why we have to use this.

1505
01:42:03,120 --> 01:42:06,400
Otherwise, in your companies
you guys will be

1506
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:13,000
using much more better teams,
but they will be paid.

1507
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:17,040
So you have to build this one
because if you want to learn,

1508
01:42:17,960 --> 01:42:20,440
you should not be looking

1509
01:42:20,440 --> 01:42:24,120
right away
for that IntelliSense of autocomplete.

1510
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:28,640
Otherwise you will get used to that
and you will not learn it.

1511
01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:35,080
So that's why have read the most pathetic.

1512
01:42:35,080 --> 01:42:36,280
They are not pathetic.

1513
01:42:36,280 --> 01:42:39,320
They are good,
but they don't help you that much in

1514
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:43,040
writing the code. But

1515
01:42:46,240 --> 01:42:49,040
for it was all recorded.

1516
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:53,760
All my groups fine.

1517
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:56,200
So if we have

1518
01:42:56,200 --> 01:42:58,080
multiple data from multiple

1519
01:42:58,080 --> 01:43:03,120
columns.

1520
01:43:03,120 --> 01:43:04,440
No, no.

1521
01:43:04,680 --> 01:43:07,440
This is not exactly what I am saying.

1522
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:08,720
Please do.

1523
01:43:08,720 --> 01:43:14,440
I am saying because we want you to learn
at at your best.

1524
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:17,400
That's why we are offering you these tools

1525
01:43:17,720 --> 01:43:20,800
so that you type everything on your own.

1526
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:22,640
Okay? This is what.

1527
01:43:22,640 --> 01:43:23,760
This is what I am saying.

1528
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:27,120
Please be.

1529
01:43:27,120 --> 01:43:29,320
You can stop recording
and tell us the truth.

1530
01:43:30,640 --> 01:43:32,160
Yes. All recording.

1531
01:43:32,160 --> 01:43:37,440
I am saying I neither confirm this fact
nor I deny this.

1532
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:42,400
You see, in that movie, it always says
whenever ask the question, it says,

1533
01:43:42,440 --> 01:43:44,680
I neither confirm nor deny this

1534
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:51,000
next bachelor

1535
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:55,400
Java notepad.

1536
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:57,720
So, guys, what do you guys think?

1537
01:43:58,080 --> 01:44:01,480
If I have to remove the duplicate data

1538
01:44:01,480 --> 01:44:04,640
from two tables,

1539
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:15,560
can you guys tell me the syntax for that?

1540
01:44:15,560 --> 01:44:18,120
And then this being tried.

1541
01:44:18,120 --> 01:44:20,640
I don't need to put this thing before

1542
01:44:20,640 --> 01:44:24,200
every column.

1543
01:44:24,200 --> 01:44:26,360
If I just put be this thing

1544
01:44:32,880 --> 01:44:36,040
in front of this column,

1545
01:44:36,040 --> 01:44:39,760
it will remove the duplicate that. Now,

1546
01:44:43,400 --> 01:44:44,280
by the way,

1547
01:44:44,280 --> 01:44:48,480
all the data is still present
in the database.

1548
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:52,760
It is just that we are fetching some

1549
01:44:53,880 --> 01:44:55,960
results from the database.

1550
01:44:55,960 --> 01:45:00,840
Any of these cuties, they are making
any changes in the database.

1551
01:45:01,200 --> 01:45:04,560
We are just fetching some data

1552
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:08,240
using different different queries
so that whatever

1553
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:13,040
in whatever form the that I store
it is still stored in that form.

1554
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:15,320
It is just a view that we are getting

1555
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:18,360
when we write this query just to see.

1556
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:21,640
Yes, no
changes are being made in the database.

1557
01:45:22,200 --> 01:45:26,320
If a person has a different first name,
but the same last name will choose

1558
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:27,960
one and remove the other.

1559
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:30,360
What do you guys think? Maman

1560
01:45:30,840 --> 01:45:32,440
As a whole,

1561
01:45:32,440 --> 01:45:35,520
when I fetch the first name
and the last name,

1562
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:40,920
and if a person has a different last name,
are there duplicate records

1563
01:45:40,920 --> 01:45:46,760
or are they unique records?

1564
01:45:46,760 --> 01:45:51,840
They are unique because the last name is
different, so they are not same anymore.

1565
01:45:53,400 --> 01:45:54,160
So unique will.

1566
01:45:54,160 --> 01:45:55,680
Not do anything but back.

1567
01:45:55,680 --> 01:45:59,160
You will still get the same result
with unique and without it.

1568
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:02,400
If a person has same first

1569
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:06,320
and the last name,
then you will get a single record.

1570
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:08,480
When you use the distinct keyword
in front.

1571
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:15,120
In here is a clear race.

1572
01:46:15,120 --> 01:46:17,440
What is distinct function in here

1573
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:21,800
as Google have you just did?

1574
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:26,600
You are in the big class.

1575
01:46:26,600 --> 01:46:42,280
Then you guys tell me
what this distinct is going in here to.

1576
01:46:42,280 --> 01:46:46,000
So if we remove an article

1577
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:49,000
to check this out,

1578
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:52,280
if I remove that distinct from here

1579
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:58,280
and if I execute discovery,

1580
01:46:58,280 --> 01:47:02,160
you see, that's
why I asked that question right now.

1581
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:08,080
You see duplicate
that are in here, right Sada And so right.

1582
01:47:08,120 --> 01:47:12,600
But if you do not want this duplication

1583
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:16,800
then you can use distinct keyword

1584
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:22,920
and it will remove the duplicate records
from your results.

1585
01:47:22,920 --> 01:47:32,520
And by the way, this is called results.

1586
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:36,240
Where can we see the number of employees

1587
01:47:36,240 --> 01:47:38,640
after executing line well?

1588
01:47:39,320 --> 01:47:41,720
And the third being

1589
01:47:42,120 --> 01:47:45,400
so by default then is if you observe

1590
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:49,240
in the output

1591
01:47:49,240 --> 01:47:54,760
window, it is showing you

1592
01:47:55,760 --> 01:47:58,960
how many rules have been written.

1593
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:03,120
Then if you see 22 rows, return

1594
01:48:03,120 --> 01:48:05,880
15 rows, return 32 rows returns,

1595
01:48:06,760 --> 01:48:11,160
and the time
it took for your query to execute

1596
01:48:12,280 --> 01:48:15,920
so you can get this information from here.

1597
01:48:15,920 --> 01:48:19,240
Otherwise
during this special duty as well,

1598
01:48:20,640 --> 01:48:24,720
that you can execute to find out
the number of records in a table

1599
01:48:24,720 --> 01:48:29,600
or the number of records that you're Kutty
so that you're curious, fetching.

1600
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:34,320
But I will teach that later.

1601
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:37,320
It will remove the duplicate
from last name as well.

1602
01:48:37,560 --> 01:48:41,040
So Nicolet combined from first name
and the last name.

1603
01:48:41,040 --> 01:48:44,720
If a person has same first name
and the last name,

1604
01:48:45,400 --> 01:48:48,840
if there are 15 persons
who have same first name and last name,

1605
01:48:48,840 --> 01:48:55,040
after using distinct,
you will see only one of them.

1606
01:48:55,040 --> 01:48:59,280
So question how to remove duplicate
from last name as well.

1607
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:04,680
So let's say
you want to have only a single job.

1608
01:49:05,720 --> 01:49:07,680
Alex It will.

1609
01:49:07,680 --> 01:49:10,320
It will effect your structure.

1610
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:11,280
You see,

1611
01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:14,160
if you want to have one

1612
01:49:14,160 --> 01:49:16,760
job, then
what will happen to these records?

1613
01:49:17,560 --> 01:49:19,920
Where should they go?

1614
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:22,080
So this question does not make sense

1615
01:49:24,120 --> 01:49:25,000
away.

1616
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:29,960
So how do you decide
if it should remove girl M.J.

1617
01:49:29,960 --> 01:49:30,920
and Sara?

1618
01:49:30,920 --> 01:49:42,280
And so this Dom, this Dom or this down?

1619
01:49:42,280 --> 01:49:44,600
So there are some things that we can do,

1620
01:49:45,360 --> 01:49:48,760
but there are things
that we should not do,

1621
01:49:48,760 --> 01:49:52,600
and there are things that are known
to make any sense to do.

1622
01:49:54,040 --> 01:49:56,560
Yes, you can do it still,

1623
01:49:56,560 --> 01:50:00,840
but you have to learn a lot of skill
for that.

1624
01:50:00,840 --> 01:50:04,680
But still, even if you learn that,
it does not make sense because.

1625
01:50:04,680 --> 01:50:05,280
Right.

1626
01:50:06,360 --> 01:50:11,080
You have to tell your duty to them
to only keep maybe Sara, Google M.J.

1627
01:50:11,080 --> 01:50:16,000
or ALEC and automatically
it will only get one gem from here.

1628
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:17,280
Or Jane or Leonardo.

1629
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:20,320
Visit whatever you want.

1630
01:50:20,320 --> 01:50:25,440
So this the table structure is will be
maintained in all the it is our search.

1631
01:50:25,440 --> 01:50:29,320
So whatever you do right,
you will get the results

1632
01:50:29,320 --> 01:50:33,600
in the form of a table.

1633
01:50:33,600 --> 01:50:37,160
If it is useless in
for just to tell is not relevant.

1634
01:50:38,200 --> 01:50:40,680
Yes. Look, in life

1635
01:50:42,120 --> 01:50:44,680
that bothered the family there

1636
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,760
where you want only one

1637
01:50:48,160 --> 01:50:49,680
election will make more sense.

1638
01:50:49,680 --> 01:51:00,240
Give it more time or a

1639
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:04,840
can you guys

1640
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:08,000
can you guys

1641
01:51:09,200 --> 01:51:12,120
I duties to give me

1642
01:51:12,840 --> 01:51:15,760
all the unique cities from this table.

1643
01:51:16,840 --> 01:51:19,680
So right now if I execute this duty

1644
01:51:21,360 --> 01:51:24,080
for the citizens I see some duplication.

1645
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:28,440
New York is three times Los

1646
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:32,200
and then Dubai Istanbul is multiple times.

1647
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:37,200
But what I only want to know how many
unique cities are there in this table.

1648
01:51:37,200 --> 01:51:40,040
Can you guys write victory

1649
01:51:40,080 --> 01:51:44,480
in here?

1650
01:51:44,480 --> 01:51:45,120
Great.

1651
01:51:45,120 --> 01:51:47,760
So select

1652
01:51:51,760 --> 01:51:53,640
this thing

1653
01:51:54,240 --> 01:51:56,960
c b from

1654
01:51:58,320 --> 01:51:59,480
Bursa.

1655
01:52:00,840 --> 01:52:03,240
You guys still will feel much more relaxed

1656
01:52:03,240 --> 01:52:07,560
after taking these skill classes,

1657
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:10,560
so I don't see any duplicate cities.

1658
01:52:10,560 --> 01:52:12,720
Is there a shortcut to run?

1659
01:52:12,720 --> 01:52:14,800
A Yes, there is a shortcut to run.

1660
01:52:14,920 --> 01:52:17,040
Simon.

1661
01:52:17,040 --> 01:52:21,120
It's the control enter shot back,

1662
01:52:22,160 --> 01:52:23,280
so it will

1663
01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:29,480
execute the last duty
in which you have placed your cursor. Yes.

1664
01:52:29,480 --> 01:52:32,680
If you guys don't pull the semicolon,
then this short person buttons,

1665
01:52:32,720 --> 01:52:40,400
they will misbehave.

1666
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:41,000
Does it work?

1667
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:41,760
Simon

1668
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:44,720
Control enter from the ultimate

1669
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:47,720
protect

1670
01:52:48,240 --> 01:53:04,040
of a law.

1671
01:53:09,320 --> 01:53:12,320
If you guys notice

1672
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:19,480
this skill workbench

1673
01:53:20,440 --> 01:53:23,920
is showing you the actual query,

1674
01:53:24,720 --> 01:53:27,680
how do that how to get not no one,

1675
01:53:27,720 --> 01:53:31,840
but I will tell you how to do that.

1676
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:34,880
If you guys notice right now,

1677
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:39,120
school work
when it is actually modifying your duties

1678
01:53:39,200 --> 01:53:42,440
that are actually
being executed on the server

1679
01:53:43,480 --> 01:53:47,080
so that if you even if you type

1680
01:53:47,080 --> 01:53:50,480
something accidentally, it does not

1681
01:53:50,480 --> 01:53:54,000
because fetching all the data from a table

1682
01:53:54,440 --> 01:53:58,960
can take up to RS
if that table has billions of red bugs.

1683
01:53:59,720 --> 01:54:03,480
So what school workbench is doing
right now?

1684
01:54:03,480 --> 01:54:04,800
It is putting a limit

1685
01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:08,640
on the number of rules that it is
fetching.

1686
01:54:10,240 --> 01:54:11,760
It is right now only fighting

1687
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:15,760
the first thousand rules.

1688
01:54:15,760 --> 01:54:22,720
But if you also want
to put a limit on your data,

1689
01:54:22,720 --> 01:54:27,720
let's say
maybe you only want the first bend rules

1690
01:54:29,160 --> 01:54:30,720
so you can also do that.

1691
01:54:30,720 --> 01:54:32,600
So you can see

1692
01:54:33,880 --> 01:54:37,760
limit and then you can specify

1693
01:54:39,040 --> 01:54:41,280
the number of rules

1694
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:51,600
that want to fetch.

1695
01:54:51,600 --> 01:54:55,320
So it has only first ten rules.

1696
01:54:55,320 --> 01:54:56,520
This time

1697
01:54:59,600 --> 01:55:01,080
by using limit

1698
01:55:01,080 --> 01:55:03,360
and then specifying the number of rules.

1699
01:55:04,680 --> 01:55:06,720
No. 11 is just a number.

1700
01:55:06,720 --> 01:55:09,520
You see it this starting from two

1701
01:55:09,520 --> 01:55:31,720
Alex It starts from two.

1702
01:55:31,720 --> 01:55:37,320
And you guys can also verify from here.

1703
01:55:37,320 --> 01:55:42,200
It saves ten rules
that it is a one column titles

1704
01:55:42,880 --> 01:55:49,240
in the one column titles.

1705
01:55:49,240 --> 01:55:51,840
How can you repeat the first ten?

1706
01:55:51,840 --> 01:55:53,920
It starts from two. Oh, okay.

1707
01:55:53,920 --> 01:55:55,440
By the way, let me tell you this also

1708
01:55:57,080 --> 01:56:00,480
in database, when we store the data,

1709
01:56:01,600 --> 01:56:04,320
it is stored

1710
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:08,400
with the help of a special algorithm.

1711
01:56:09,400 --> 01:56:11,800
And these algorithms, they differ

1712
01:56:11,800 --> 01:56:14,840
from companies, company to company.

1713
01:56:14,840 --> 01:56:19,280
So the structure, the the insertion

1714
01:56:19,280 --> 01:56:23,160
order of the data can never be

1715
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,640
you guys can never be 100% sure.

1716
01:56:27,080 --> 01:56:31,440
If you are inserting something
at a specific time,

1717
01:56:31,840 --> 01:56:34,840
you will always be getting that data
in that order.

1718
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:37,200
It is random.

1719
01:56:37,200 --> 01:56:40,440
It depends how your database
is stored in the data.

1720
01:56:40,440 --> 01:56:44,920
So this this, this information in here,

1721
01:56:45,720 --> 01:56:49,200
most of the time
it will be in order of the ID,

1722
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:52,720
but you can never guarantee it is returned

1723
01:56:52,720 --> 01:56:56,040
in a completely random order.

1724
01:56:56,040 --> 01:56:57,880
If we have to guarantee that buying

1725
01:56:57,880 --> 01:57:01,080
a specific order,
I will teach you how to do that.

1726
01:57:01,360 --> 01:57:04,400
So it is fine if you see 11 in here.

1727
01:57:04,440 --> 01:57:06,520
If you see three in here, it is fine.

1728
01:57:06,920 --> 01:57:09,880
We will see how to tackle this in four.

1729
01:57:09,960 --> 01:57:12,960
And then this problem in execution

1730
01:57:15,160 --> 01:57:17,160
white paint and then came before it.

1731
01:57:17,160 --> 01:57:20,080
It can also come in before.

1732
01:57:20,080 --> 01:57:21,600
So it's random.

1733
01:57:21,600 --> 01:57:25,640
It is not in our control.

1734
01:57:25,640 --> 01:57:30,480
Good approach is use uppercase
for the reserved keywords.

1735
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:34,600
By the way,
I also not using it all the time.

1736
01:57:34,680 --> 01:57:40,320
I should, but it will work
even if you write

1737
01:57:42,640 --> 01:57:45,000
it in uppercase or note or in whatever.

1738
01:57:45,280 --> 01:57:49,200
But I usually I have seen uppercase
use looks good,

1739
01:57:49,200 --> 01:57:54,200
and most of the developers,
they follow this.

1740
01:57:54,200 --> 01:57:58,280
So can we get different 10% each time?

1741
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:03,680
No, most probably
you guys will be getting the same results

1742
01:58:04,160 --> 01:58:06,240
as I am getting in here.

1743
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:11,480
If you execute on this same quality,
do you guys get different results?

1744
01:58:11,480 --> 01:58:20,760
You should not.

1745
01:58:20,760 --> 01:58:23,120
It should be same. Same.

1746
01:58:23,160 --> 01:58:27,600
You should can
always the same results, but

1747
01:58:28,720 --> 01:58:30,600
we cannot guarantee that

1748
01:58:30,600 --> 01:58:33,760
that query for is number
ten is before eight.

1749
01:58:35,120 --> 01:58:36,960
Then we have nine, then we have 11.

1750
01:58:36,960 --> 01:58:41,160
So this order is not guaranteed,
but same duty will return,

1751
01:58:41,160 --> 01:58:52,280
same results.

1752
01:58:52,280 --> 01:58:52,880
All right.

1753
01:58:52,880 --> 01:58:59,160
So you guys now understand how to fact did
that.

1754
01:58:59,160 --> 01:59:01,480
Are from any column, right.

1755
01:59:02,040 --> 01:59:05,280
And how to figure it out
from all the columns.

1756
01:59:06,480 --> 01:59:09,680
Now, let me show you how to.

1757
01:59:09,680 --> 01:59:14,280
So right now, you guys can filter out
the columns, right?

1758
01:59:14,640 --> 01:59:15,760
And it depends on you.

1759
01:59:15,760 --> 01:59:17,960
Maybe you want to get to that first name.

1760
01:59:17,960 --> 01:59:21,800
Last name, maybe from city
or maybe you want to all of them.

1761
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:26,160
Now, let me tell you how
we can filter out the rules

1762
01:59:27,920 --> 01:59:30,200
to filter the rows we use.

1763
01:59:30,200 --> 01:59:31,440
The we are close

1764
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:34,440
to to filter out the columns.

1765
01:59:34,440 --> 01:59:35,880
We use the select clause.

1766
01:59:35,880 --> 01:59:38,520
By the way,
these are called clauses in school.

1767
01:59:39,440 --> 01:59:42,800
So to filter out the columns,
we use the select clause

1768
01:59:43,760 --> 01:59:48,720
to mention the table names
from which we want to get to that.

1769
01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:53,080
We use the from clause
and to filter out rules.

1770
01:59:53,080 --> 01:59:55,040
We use the word clause.

1771
01:59:55,040 --> 01:59:58,920
So let's say for example,

1772
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:02,160
by the way, you guys can also do this.

1773
02:00:02,160 --> 02:00:04,680
You can select
a portion of the query as well.

1774
02:00:04,680 --> 02:00:07,920
If you just want to execute
that specific portion,

1775
02:00:09,040 --> 02:00:15,960
it will also work.

1776
02:00:15,960 --> 02:00:19,960
So you see it has only executed
your select all from person.

1777
02:00:21,280 --> 02:00:23,080
So party you select

1778
02:00:23,080 --> 02:00:32,200
it will only execute that part.

1779
02:00:32,200 --> 02:00:35,520
So the reserved keyword

1780
02:00:35,520 --> 02:00:39,280
to filter out
the rows is called to be where clause.

1781
02:00:40,360 --> 02:00:42,120
Let's say

1782
02:00:48,160 --> 02:00:49,640
I'm removing this element.

1783
02:00:49,640 --> 02:00:51,800
Let's say

1784
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:54,280
we only

1785
02:00:55,120 --> 02:00:57,240
want to be employ

1786
02:00:57,640 --> 02:01:00,440
employers that have employee already. 120

1787
02:01:01,800 --> 02:01:06,120
So what we will do, we will write, we're

1788
02:01:07,760 --> 02:01:10,680
after that, we will write the column name

1789
02:01:12,480 --> 02:01:15,960
MP ID and then we can write

1790
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:20,760
the conditions the same as in Java.

1791
02:01:20,760 --> 02:01:24,240
So in here I am saying equal.

1792
02:01:25,360 --> 02:01:28,120
So in Java one equal to sign

1793
02:01:28,120 --> 02:01:31,320
is meant for assignment

1794
02:01:31,320 --> 02:01:34,960
and to equal to signs
are meant for comparison.

1795
02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:35,320
Right.

1796
02:01:35,320 --> 02:01:40,040
But in here
one equal to sign is meant for comparison.

1797
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:43,240
So right now what I am saying to a skill,
I am saying hey,

1798
02:01:43,240 --> 02:01:46,640
a skill.

1799
02:01:46,640 --> 02:01:47,720
Okay, then

1800
02:01:48,720 --> 02:01:51,120
select all the columns

1801
02:01:52,480 --> 02:01:54,600
from this table

1802
02:01:54,600 --> 02:01:58,680
where in already is equal to 120.

1803
02:01:59,440 --> 02:02:03,560
But if I execute this query,

1804
02:02:03,560 --> 02:02:34,480
can you guys guess the output?

1805
02:02:34,480 --> 02:02:36,760
No need of double course.

1806
02:02:37,320 --> 02:02:43,360
Yes. Let me tell you, when you guys need
these double single code

1807
02:02:43,800 --> 02:02:47,880
and when you guys don't need
if the data is an automatic,

1808
02:02:49,080 --> 02:02:50,160
we don't need it.

1809
02:02:50,160 --> 02:02:52,320
Same as in Java.

1810
02:02:52,320 --> 02:02:56,480
If the data is an automatic,
we don't need those polls.

1811
02:02:57,240 --> 02:03:02,760
If the data is based on text,
then we need to double this course.

1812
02:03:02,760 --> 02:03:07,440
But what the skill gives you
this flexibility,

1813
02:03:07,440 --> 02:03:09,480
even if the data is a pneumatic

1814
02:03:10,320 --> 02:03:17,840
and if even if you use the single course,
it will still work.

1815
02:03:18,400 --> 02:03:21,240
But in actual

1816
02:03:21,240 --> 02:03:23,480
sometimes

1817
02:03:24,240 --> 02:03:27,080
it can be super, super slow

1818
02:03:27,080 --> 02:03:30,000
because ESC maintains and

1819
02:03:33,320 --> 02:03:35,960
index behind these scenes

1820
02:03:36,600 --> 02:03:39,120
to speed up your queries.

1821
02:03:39,120 --> 02:03:41,520
So if you had it even using

1822
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:45,800
for the numeric data, yes,
it will work, but it might be slow.

1823
02:03:46,160 --> 02:03:49,360
So if you know for sure

1824
02:03:49,360 --> 02:03:51,520
that that will always be

1825
02:03:53,280 --> 02:03:55,120
numeric don't use.

1826
02:03:55,120 --> 02:04:03,280
Because if the data is string
then you should be able to single course

1827
02:04:04,720 --> 02:04:07,360
and skill is very, very flexible.

1828
02:04:07,360 --> 02:04:10,640
So it will allow you to use
a single course, double course

1829
02:04:10,640 --> 02:04:13,680
without course, but sometimes you guys

1830
02:04:13,680 --> 02:04:16,040
might not get the correct results.

1831
02:04:16,720 --> 02:04:19,400
So let's follow the best practices and

1832
02:04:20,640 --> 02:04:24,160
for the numeric,
let's not use double use single course.

1833
02:04:24,560 --> 02:04:29,000
And for this thing this data lets you
because if in

1834
02:04:29,120 --> 02:04:33,000
we don't use double
if string, we use our double course.

1835
02:04:33,360 --> 02:04:39,040
Alex this skill it exports everything
for spring and non spring.

1836
02:04:39,040 --> 02:04:44,000
You can always use a single
or double course, but the Oracle database

1837
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:48,120
is a little stricter
stricter than this scale one.

1838
02:04:48,720 --> 02:04:51,200
It will not allow you
to use the double course.

1839
02:04:51,200 --> 02:04:52,280
By the way,

1840
02:04:52,840 --> 02:04:56,040
let me tell you how to practice

1841
02:04:56,040 --> 02:05:00,000
your skill skills on Oracle database
as well.

1842
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:05,600
Side by side by guys
type Oracle live in your browser or

1843
02:05:07,760 --> 02:05:10,040
sorry, now you will learn the difference

1844
02:05:10,240 --> 02:05:12,760
and why I'm saying
these are the best practices

1845
02:05:12,760 --> 02:05:16,520
because you will see those things
will not work on Oracle database,

1846
02:05:16,520 --> 02:05:19,680
which I am asking you to avoid.

1847
02:05:19,680 --> 02:05:21,840
Do you guys see this page

1848
02:05:23,080 --> 02:05:26,360
type Oracle live
and let me know what you buy.

1849
02:05:26,360 --> 02:05:27,840
See this page

1850
02:05:50,560 --> 02:05:51,400
for Lamar?

1851
02:05:51,400 --> 02:05:53,640
Because a lot of students
are trying to use it.

1852
02:05:54,240 --> 02:05:56,760
You might face
this issue, try to deflect this page

1853
02:06:00,240 --> 02:06:02,520
because right now around 70 to 80

1854
02:06:02,520 --> 02:06:18,000
people are trying to access the same page.

1855
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:18,640
I will wait.

1856
02:06:18,640 --> 02:06:21,120
Don't let me know once
everyone has this page

1857
02:06:22,400 --> 02:06:25,160
or Oracle index student

1858
02:06:31,200 --> 02:06:31,560
alone.

1859
02:06:31,560 --> 02:06:36,680
Actually, this is a free Web site,
so that's why they didn't

1860
02:06:36,720 --> 02:06:44,040
spend that much money here.

1861
02:06:44,040 --> 02:06:46,400
Look, it's free, man. It's free.

1862
02:06:47,680 --> 02:06:48,880
We should be thankful.

1863
02:06:48,880 --> 02:06:51,000
Even if exporting it.

1864
02:06:51,080 --> 02:06:59,640
Students.

1865
02:06:59,640 --> 02:07:01,800
So those are hopefully.

1866
02:07:01,800 --> 02:07:05,560
Is there anyone who is a product
which apparently little pages

1867
02:07:05,560 --> 02:07:09,160
still loading?

1868
02:07:09,160 --> 02:07:13,000
Okay, now click on my session

1869
02:07:16,800 --> 02:07:17,560
and offer

1870
02:07:17,560 --> 02:07:23,040
to be there to use the same username
and password that you guys created

1871
02:07:23,120 --> 02:07:27,240
when you were signing up for to install

1872
02:07:27,240 --> 02:07:28,200
your java

1873
02:07:36,240 --> 02:07:38,880
usernames and passwords index.

1874
02:07:38,880 --> 02:07:43,680
I thought, I'm one, two, three.

1875
02:07:43,680 --> 02:07:46,800
It will automatically in here

1876
02:07:51,600 --> 02:07:54,240
if you guys don't remember
you going to create one for that

1877
02:07:54,240 --> 02:08:01,200
click on school worksheet.

1878
02:08:01,200 --> 02:08:02,760
Try to click on school worksheet.

1879
02:08:02,760 --> 02:08:10,640
It might work without the username,
then someone can find me

1880
02:08:10,640 --> 02:08:18,240
if it is working without the username.

1881
02:08:18,240 --> 02:08:19,760
Okay then create.

1882
02:08:19,760 --> 02:08:23,000
If you guys don't remember,
please create your use of names in here.

1883
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:26,120
We will be a lot on this as well.

1884
02:08:26,120 --> 02:08:29,640
Some of your homework
assignments are also designed for

1885
02:08:30,800 --> 02:08:31,560
this Oracle

1886
02:08:31,560 --> 02:08:40,800
database.

1887
02:08:40,800 --> 02:08:44,000
Is there to be time for the
break it to do.

1888
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:47,760
You know we had to break on
but yes, not now.

1889
02:08:47,880 --> 02:08:57,080
After maybe 30 minutes.

1890
02:08:57,080 --> 02:09:03,160
Yes, you should create account
if you guys don't remember.

1891
02:09:03,160 --> 02:09:05,240
No. You need a break on.

1892
02:09:05,360 --> 02:09:10,120
No, I was thinking because maybe you guys,
meanwhile can clear

1893
02:09:10,120 --> 02:09:13,800
the usernames in the break
so that we don't waste

1894
02:09:13,800 --> 02:09:20,440
time.

1895
02:09:20,440 --> 02:09:20,920
Sorry.

1896
02:09:20,920 --> 02:09:22,760
What are we supposed to remember?

1897
02:09:22,760 --> 02:09:28,200
Assignment these username and password
to sign for Oracle is the same

1898
02:09:28,560 --> 02:09:31,200
that you guys used to download with Java

1899
02:09:32,200 --> 02:09:35,960
when you guys started learning double.

1900
02:09:35,960 --> 02:09:41,760
If you guys don't remember
you would unclear to me. One.

1901
02:09:41,760 --> 02:09:45,360
So this is something companies
don't use Maryam material disparage

1902
02:09:45,360 --> 02:09:46,280
you mean

1903
02:09:50,760 --> 02:09:54,720
but not no companies they don't use it

1904
02:09:54,720 --> 02:10:00,560
just to test the oracle syntax
the database syntax from Oracle.

1905
02:10:01,800 --> 02:10:04,360
I don't remember signing up for download
there they get.

1906
02:10:05,160 --> 02:10:07,080
That's great

1907
02:10:08,120 --> 02:10:09,680
assignment. Just sign up.

1908
02:10:09,680 --> 02:10:13,080
I need to ask you for me

1909
02:10:13,080 --> 02:10:15,120
username and password on this page

1910
02:10:16,560 --> 02:10:18,600
or maybe I will teach you

1911
02:10:21,360 --> 02:10:24,480
these things on Oracle one

1912
02:10:24,480 --> 02:10:27,040
after a little while

1913
02:10:28,800 --> 02:10:31,280
because it will take some time
to create the accounts.

1914
02:10:31,360 --> 02:10:36,960
Let's let's practice
more on the great syntax at then

1915
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:39,040
database.

1916
02:10:39,040 --> 02:10:42,960
And I want you all of you have created
your username and password.

1917
02:10:42,960 --> 02:10:47,520
Then we will also learn how to do
same on Oracle one.

1918
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:50,280
Guys, please,

1919
02:10:50,680 --> 02:10:51,560
please.

1920
02:10:51,560 --> 02:10:54,920
Let's get back to the class
and during the break you guys can create

1921
02:10:54,920 --> 02:10:57,960
your usernames and passwords

1922
02:11:01,920 --> 02:11:05,280
if everyone back.

1923
02:11:05,280 --> 02:11:13,080
Well, we're going to create that username
and password later on.

1924
02:11:13,080 --> 02:11:15,480
Did I miss anything?

1925
02:11:15,480 --> 02:11:16,320
I don't know.

1926
02:11:16,320 --> 02:11:21,520
What about when did you left
and when you joined back?

1927
02:11:21,920 --> 02:11:22,800
It depends.

1928
02:11:22,800 --> 02:11:26,640
If you left after 15 years, the class
started.

1929
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,120
You have missed a lot and

1930
02:11:30,280 --> 02:11:31,760
our internet went down.

1931
02:11:31,760 --> 02:11:34,680
Internet
shut down when we tried to sign in.

1932
02:11:34,680 --> 02:11:38,240
When did you guys
when did your Internet went down?

1933
02:11:38,400 --> 02:11:40,240
Mohamud Arwa

1934
02:11:44,280 --> 02:11:45,360
A month ago.

1935
02:11:45,360 --> 02:11:47,040
A moment ago.

1936
02:11:47,040 --> 02:11:49,520
They told me not to tell
you guys don't miss anything.

1937
02:11:49,960 --> 02:11:50,320
That's

1938
02:11:56,680 --> 02:11:59,640
new. Guys, remember writing this query

1939
02:11:59,640 --> 02:12:03,040
just like

1940
02:12:14,440 --> 02:12:14,880
this.

1941
02:12:15,960 --> 02:12:20,280
Okay, So can you guys

1942
02:12:20,280 --> 02:12:22,440
now write a query

1943
02:12:27,920 --> 02:12:28,640
the man

1944
02:12:28,640 --> 02:12:32,480
not believe me,
you don't need anything to it now.

1945
02:12:32,480 --> 02:12:35,200
No cake, no cookies,
nothing. Please, please.

1946
02:12:35,200 --> 02:12:36,600
Beyond night.

1947
02:12:36,600 --> 02:12:48,520
It's already too much.

1948
02:12:48,520 --> 02:12:50,760
I'm just joking. Please do it. Provided.

1949
02:12:50,760 --> 02:12:51,240
Thank you.

1950
02:12:51,240 --> 02:12:54,480
And you, madam.

1951
02:12:54,480 --> 02:12:57,120
You didn't see them online pictures.

1952
02:12:57,120 --> 02:13:07,800
He's already very healthy.

1953
02:13:07,800 --> 02:13:08,520
All right, guys.

1954
02:13:08,520 --> 02:13:17,240
So can you guys abide?

1955
02:13:17,240 --> 02:13:19,320
Yes. Aisha.

1956
02:13:19,320 --> 02:13:20,640
So you see those?

1957
02:13:20,640 --> 02:13:22,080
They already know everything.

1958
02:13:22,080 --> 02:13:27,240
What is going on in their families,
in their lives the dead, even They don't.

1959
02:13:27,240 --> 02:13:29,960
It does not matter
if they are classmates, colleagues.

1960
02:13:30,120 --> 02:13:34,320
They have all the information
from each of the.

1961
02:13:34,320 --> 02:13:34,800
Okay,

1962
02:13:38,200 --> 02:13:39,960
No, no, we pay attention.

1963
02:13:39,960 --> 02:13:47,080
But it is very fast communication.

1964
02:13:47,080 --> 02:13:49,200
All right, guys,

1965
02:13:49,440 --> 02:13:55,280
can you write take
you read to only fetch the employers

1966
02:13:55,280 --> 02:14:00,160
whose last name is Gem.

1967
02:14:00,160 --> 02:14:01,800
Where is Alex? Alex.

1968
02:14:01,800 --> 02:14:16,680
Now you will see only one gem.

1969
02:14:16,680 --> 02:14:33,920
And you guys that I take every
If I only want to see one,

1970
02:14:33,920 --> 02:14:36,000
I am meeting as we are speaking

1971
02:14:37,040 --> 02:14:39,720
of all to.

1972
02:14:39,720 --> 02:14:41,880
I cannot stop it.

1973
02:14:41,880 --> 02:14:43,680
I believe my baby girl.

1974
02:14:43,680 --> 02:14:46,560
It's good is good. Getting being hungry.

1975
02:14:46,560 --> 02:14:49,920
I think it's. It's super simple. Is it?

1976
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:50,680
This song?

1977
02:14:50,680 --> 02:14:52,080
You'll need to

1978
02:14:54,360 --> 02:14:55,400
select all

1979
02:14:55,400 --> 02:14:58,480
from person we had last
name is equal to them.

1980
02:14:58,520 --> 02:15:01,600
Did we go through the Oracle worksheet
into that one down?

1981
02:15:02,040 --> 02:15:02,640
No moment.

1982
02:15:02,640 --> 02:15:07,840
We will do that, including giving.

1983
02:15:07,840 --> 02:15:13,200
So if the column contains
the text based that, that

1984
02:15:14,560 --> 02:15:17,240
and as part of the request of Alex,

1985
02:15:17,240 --> 02:15:19,440
we want to see only one damn

1986
02:15:21,080 --> 02:15:23,720
we can use the

1987
02:15:25,040 --> 02:15:27,600
where clause

1988
02:15:27,640 --> 02:15:31,400
and we need to specify the last name

1989
02:15:34,440 --> 02:15:37,320
equal to single course best practice

1990
02:15:38,320 --> 02:15:40,960
and we need that.

1991
02:15:41,080 --> 02:15:43,840
What do you think if I put uppercase them,

1992
02:15:45,120 --> 02:15:53,920
will it work?

1993
02:15:53,920 --> 02:15:54,960
Well, it works.

1994
02:15:54,960 --> 02:15:58,040
Why it works dies because obscurely is

1995
02:15:59,160 --> 02:16:03,600
keys in in sensitive.

1996
02:16:03,600 --> 02:16:05,520
But remember

1997
02:16:06,120 --> 02:16:07,840
this uppercase thing.

1998
02:16:07,840 --> 02:16:12,120
It will only work on my school database.

1999
02:16:12,120 --> 02:16:13,560
It will not one.

2000
02:16:13,560 --> 02:16:19,200
It will not work on Oracle. One.

2001
02:16:19,200 --> 02:16:20,080
So what?

2002
02:16:20,080 --> 02:16:22,160
What should be the best practice?

2003
02:16:22,160 --> 02:16:25,240
Yes. Inside this single course,
it is clear

2004
02:16:25,280 --> 02:16:28,200
some databases are sensitive,
some are not.

2005
02:16:28,560 --> 02:16:30,880
So as a best practice, what should we do?

2006
02:16:31,800 --> 02:16:34,920
We should not try to have

2007
02:16:34,920 --> 02:16:37,920
some fun
inside of the double course because

2008
02:16:39,200 --> 02:16:40,520
you guys might be using

2009
02:16:40,520 --> 02:16:43,720
Oracle on your jobs
and then you will blame me.

2010
02:16:44,440 --> 02:16:47,200
Is there anything that is sensitive. Yes.

2011
02:16:47,480 --> 02:16:52,080
The text inside the course is
this case is sensitive

2012
02:16:52,280 --> 02:17:03,080
for some of the databases,
but not all of them.

2013
02:17:03,080 --> 02:17:05,400
Okay. Alexa, are you happy now?

2014
02:17:05,400 --> 02:17:07,320
Oh, we'll still see a lot of them.

2015
02:17:07,320 --> 02:17:11,400
Alex wanted only one.

2016
02:17:11,400 --> 02:17:23,760
Alexa, can you modify this query
to get only one gem?

2017
02:17:23,760 --> 02:17:26,000
Then you guys tell me how to write.

2018
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,040
Modify this clearly to get only one.

2019
02:17:28,080 --> 02:17:32,600
Yeah.

2020
02:17:32,600 --> 02:17:34,120
Distinct.

2021
02:17:34,160 --> 02:17:38,600
Are you guys sure?

2022
02:17:38,600 --> 02:17:40,760
Take out the star

2023
02:17:42,760 --> 02:17:45,760
name.

2024
02:17:45,760 --> 02:17:48,160
Just add this thing

2025
02:17:48,160 --> 02:17:49,720
I am using stored in here.

2026
02:17:49,720 --> 02:17:50,600
Will it work?

2027
02:17:50,600 --> 02:17:52,880
The distinct
Those who are saying distinct.

2028
02:17:52,880 --> 02:17:54,160
I am using a start in here.

2029
02:17:54,160 --> 02:17:57,000
Will it work?

2030
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:59,040
Because why? Why? It will not work?

2031
02:18:00,280 --> 02:18:01,880
Because if

2032
02:18:01,880 --> 02:18:06,000
I could be complete role.

2033
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:07,320
It is not unique.

2034
02:18:07,320 --> 02:18:10,440
This role is different
from this one, right?

2035
02:18:11,320 --> 02:18:14,040
It will not work.

2036
02:18:14,040 --> 02:18:18,560
So it depends how many columns
you are selecting in your select clause.

2037
02:18:19,120 --> 02:18:23,960
If as if you are selecting 15 rows
and if we combine the data

2038
02:18:24,080 --> 02:18:28,400
of 3015 columns, and if you combine
the data from 15 columns

2039
02:18:28,400 --> 02:18:30,800
and then that that is not unique,

2040
02:18:31,440 --> 02:18:38,800
then the string will not do anything.

2041
02:18:38,800 --> 02:18:41,880
All the

2042
02:18:43,680 --> 02:18:45,280
can you guys

2043
02:18:45,280 --> 02:18:51,920
write a query?

2044
02:18:51,920 --> 02:18:52,720
It is easy.

2045
02:18:52,720 --> 02:18:53,440
Is it easy?

2046
02:18:53,440 --> 02:19:01,200
Database.

2047
02:19:01,200 --> 02:19:04,320
Then you guys write a few to fetch

2048
02:19:04,320 --> 02:19:07,720
all the persons are who have

2049
02:19:09,040 --> 02:19:13,680
age as greater than 23.

2050
02:19:13,680 --> 02:19:16,600
All the data from this table for

2051
02:19:16,720 --> 02:19:20,200
for which the age is greater than 23.

2052
02:19:20,920 --> 02:19:27,040
Anyways, right click on that.

2053
02:19:27,040 --> 02:19:30,000
Then I run a line 19 please.

2054
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:31,800
Yes, obviously you can run now.

2055
02:19:31,800 --> 02:19:33,200
Why you are asking.

2056
02:19:33,200 --> 02:19:40,920
You can run anything on your computer.

2057
02:19:40,920 --> 02:19:42,320
Is this okay

2058
02:19:43,600 --> 02:19:44,560
here?

2059
02:19:45,240 --> 02:19:48,960
If yes, maybe your result is good

2060
02:19:51,920 --> 02:19:52,920
with line 19.

2061
02:19:52,920 --> 02:20:03,240
You are working just with.

2062
02:20:03,240 --> 02:20:06,080
Yes, the complete line 19 like this.

2063
02:20:06,720 --> 02:20:12,840
Now. Like this complete.

2064
02:20:13,400 --> 02:20:15,000
Yes. So

2065
02:20:22,040 --> 02:20:29,520
this is the output.

2066
02:20:29,520 --> 02:20:34,520
While all you do
it is just because of how my will work.

2067
02:20:34,520 --> 02:20:38,360
When you displays the results,
it will always display and null rule.

2068
02:20:38,760 --> 02:20:40,920
No matter what you do write.

2069
02:20:40,920 --> 02:20:43,200
It is just how display

2070
02:20:45,760 --> 02:20:47,160
of the is.

2071
02:20:47,160 --> 02:20:51,920
So if we want to get the battle,

2072
02:20:53,160 --> 02:20:55,080
if we want to get the persons

2073
02:20:55,080 --> 02:20:58,320
who are older than 23.

2074
02:20:58,320 --> 02:21:01,120
We tried to

2075
02:21:05,920 --> 02:21:08,600
pass their age

2076
02:21:09,880 --> 02:21:22,000
is greater than 23 is.

2077
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:31,760
And what if I want to get all
the employees who have aged less than 25

2078
02:21:34,320 --> 02:21:35,760
line 105?

2079
02:21:35,760 --> 02:21:39,360
You live in Dubai?

2080
02:21:39,360 --> 02:21:40,640
Oh, yes.

2081
02:21:40,640 --> 02:21:45,000
As part of this database.

2082
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:45,960
Right. Can you write it?

2083
02:21:45,960 --> 02:21:49,240
You need to find all the employees
who have aged less than

2084
02:21:49,600 --> 02:21:55,680
25. This

2085
02:21:59,960 --> 02:22:00,280
right?

2086
02:22:00,280 --> 02:22:01,760
So same as Java.

2087
02:22:01,760 --> 02:22:04,600
Greater than less than

2088
02:22:05,280 --> 02:22:06,720
what they've

2089
02:22:08,160 --> 02:22:10,920
less than or equal to 25.

2090
02:22:11,680 --> 02:22:13,920
Can you guys guess this index less than or

2091
02:22:13,920 --> 02:22:46,880
equal to 25.

2092
02:22:46,880 --> 02:22:52,360
So I got 25 and all the results,
by the way, should be ages.

2093
02:22:53,160 --> 02:23:00,680
I am not getting greater than 23. Why?

2094
02:23:00,680 --> 02:23:05,280
And I will make sure
you are executing the acuity

2095
02:23:05,280 --> 02:23:08,760
that is on line 20 that you read like
I am selecting and you

2096
02:23:09,120 --> 02:23:11,280
then execute it.

2097
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:15,320
And guess if you still get wrong

2098
02:23:15,360 --> 02:23:21,920
results, is everyone getting the results

2099
02:23:22,160 --> 02:23:28,400
as of your expectations?

2100
02:23:28,400 --> 02:23:29,320
Okay.

2101
02:23:29,320 --> 02:23:30,040
Thank you.

2102
02:23:30,040 --> 02:23:37,120
Great.

2103
02:23:37,120 --> 02:23:42,960
Again, you guys write acuity
for to get all the records cards for

2104
02:23:42,960 --> 02:23:58,760
which age is not equal to country 308

2105
02:23:59,680 --> 02:24:24,800
you do not equal to 25 mark

2106
02:24:26,520 --> 02:24:31,280
all the ages, but not 25.

2107
02:24:31,280 --> 02:24:35,680
Then we use a couple
where statements are Alexa.

2108
02:24:35,680 --> 02:24:37,680
I will teach you how to do that, guys. But

2109
02:24:43,600 --> 02:24:44,520
you see,

2110
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:47,280
that mirror
has written a different syntax.

2111
02:24:47,280 --> 02:24:49,520
Can you guys provide that syntax as well

2112
02:24:50,280 --> 02:24:53,360
and confirm it backwards?

2113
02:24:53,360 --> 02:25:02,000
I mean, has used this syntax?

2114
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:05,840
Yes, we can select
only those who live in Istanbul

2115
02:25:08,440 --> 02:25:11,160
and that also works.

2116
02:25:11,160 --> 02:25:14,840
So for specifying and not equal to

2117
02:25:15,680 --> 02:25:18,480
we can use two symbols this

2118
02:25:19,680 --> 02:25:21,240
greater than less than combined.

2119
02:25:21,240 --> 02:25:22,920
And this one.

2120
02:25:23,280 --> 02:25:28,480
So some of the databases,
they might not spell this one.

2121
02:25:29,520 --> 02:25:31,520
So you guys can try this one.

2122
02:25:31,520 --> 02:25:35,520
Some of the ways they might support
this one and then don't support this one

2123
02:25:37,040 --> 02:25:39,480
and no, we cannot use it in Java.

2124
02:25:40,800 --> 02:25:42,520
In Java is standard,

2125
02:25:42,520 --> 02:25:47,480
as is also standard,
but which companies following it 100%

2126
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,720
depends on that company

2127
02:25:52,720 --> 02:25:53,400
break time?

2128
02:25:53,400 --> 02:25:53,920
No hard.

2129
02:25:53,920 --> 02:25:58,320
But we had a break on 1210 so it's 121

2130
02:25:58,440 --> 02:26:01,400
not intending let's have it after minutes.

2131
02:26:01,400 --> 02:26:02,320
Are you guys tired?

2132
02:26:02,320 --> 02:26:17,080
Need a break?

2133
02:26:17,080 --> 02:26:19,760
I want you to make the. Oh, my God.

2134
02:26:20,120 --> 02:26:22,160
No one at home to make tea.

2135
02:26:22,160 --> 02:26:23,840
No girlfriend, no wife.

2136
02:26:23,840 --> 02:26:27,160
At least my girlfriend knows
how to make tea.

2137
02:26:27,160 --> 02:26:32,680
He agreed
she will make me tea, but nothing else.

2138
02:26:32,680 --> 02:26:34,560
No, no, no, no.

2139
02:26:34,560 --> 02:26:38,840
Court Chai, I want more.

2140
02:26:38,840 --> 02:26:39,360
Come. It's

2141
02:26:41,480 --> 02:26:43,440
okay.

2142
02:26:44,440 --> 02:26:46,400
Can you guys write a

2143
02:26:46,400 --> 02:26:49,920
query to fetch the first name

2144
02:26:50,160 --> 02:26:53,400
and the last name

2145
02:26:53,400 --> 02:26:59,040
of all the emails? Yes.

2146
02:26:59,280 --> 02:27:09,200
He also makes me buy bread.

2147
02:27:09,200 --> 02:27:23,560
Most of all, the cake is gone.

2148
02:27:23,560 --> 02:27:24,400
Guys.

2149
02:27:25,080 --> 02:27:27,360
I want all the first names.

2150
02:27:27,360 --> 02:27:34,640
Last names for all the meals.

2151
02:27:34,640 --> 02:27:37,200
All the first names and the last names.

2152
02:27:37,440 --> 02:27:49,480
All for all the males.

2153
02:27:49,480 --> 02:27:50,920
So select

2154
02:27:51,760 --> 02:27:55,080
first name on the

2155
02:27:55,080 --> 02:27:59,040
last names from

2156
02:27:59,920 --> 02:28:02,640
Son where

2157
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:04,520
the gender is.

2158
02:28:04,520 --> 02:28:10,200
Is there
anyone who was unable to write this query?

2159
02:28:10,200 --> 02:28:18,560
Is there anyone who was unable
to write this query? No.

2160
02:28:19,200 --> 02:28:19,800
All good.

2161
02:28:19,800 --> 02:28:21,960
You guys love the you guys are

2162
02:28:23,400 --> 02:28:24,720
loving school.

2163
02:28:24,720 --> 02:28:27,400
All easy peasy. Woodward.

2164
02:28:27,400 --> 02:28:29,800
So first name, last name of all.

2165
02:28:30,160 --> 02:28:33,000
You guys can also display the agenda
just to

2166
02:28:35,280 --> 02:28:36,320
verify being for

2167
02:28:38,080 --> 02:28:39,400
big boys and big building.

2168
02:28:39,400 --> 02:28:45,320
Now. Okay, so all

2169
02:28:47,560 --> 02:28:52,560
okay, you guys are champions.

2170
02:28:52,560 --> 02:29:13,080
All right, electronic lecture
learn next, right?

2171
02:29:13,120 --> 02:29:18,000
Give me that check
if you guys can do the homework or not.

2172
02:29:18,720 --> 02:29:21,240
You guys already know select from

2173
02:29:22,400 --> 02:29:23,360
use commands.

2174
02:29:23,360 --> 02:29:27,000
Two separate columns
start to get everything.

2175
02:29:27,440 --> 02:29:27,920
Oh, yes.

2176
02:29:27,920 --> 02:29:30,560
We were ready for the task.

2177
02:29:30,880 --> 02:29:33,360
Okay, Well, do you anticipate

2178
02:29:33,360 --> 02:29:37,080
there are a lot of jackpot
come back or both?

2179
02:29:37,080 --> 02:29:40,960
Okay, so how about remove
first and gender on the line?

2180
02:29:41,320 --> 02:29:45,400
Foster gender on the line.

2181
02:29:45,400 --> 02:29:47,280
Read it in few classes.

2182
02:29:47,280 --> 02:29:49,760
It will get complicated here.

2183
02:29:49,760 --> 02:29:51,480
Not as good.

2184
02:29:51,480 --> 02:29:55,320
I think a school is all easy

2185
02:30:02,280 --> 02:30:04,960
because I am taking it with lawmakers.

2186
02:30:04,960 --> 02:30:06,880
Even if it is hard, it will become easy.

2187
02:30:06,880 --> 02:30:10,160
Right?

2188
02:30:10,160 --> 02:30:12,080
They have to

2189
02:30:13,240 --> 02:30:13,920
do teaching

2190
02:30:13,920 --> 02:30:18,320
APIs law.

2191
02:30:18,320 --> 02:30:19,400
If I teach everything,

2192
02:30:19,400 --> 02:30:23,240
how would you guys know if I am very,
very good at teaching, right?

2193
02:30:23,880 --> 02:30:26,920
You guys will say, Oh,
so there was just average

2194
02:30:29,440 --> 02:30:32,040
queen was not will that teaching

2195
02:30:32,040 --> 02:30:32,880
week already.

2196
02:30:32,880 --> 02:30:40,800
No you'll see no.

2197
02:30:40,800 --> 02:30:45,360
Okay stop recording
We will have a session of 52 minutes

2198
02:30:45,360 --> 02:30:51,080
at the of the class and confessed It's

2199
02:30:53,280 --> 02:30:54,000
all right.

2200
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:55,680
As we have

2201
02:30:56,280 --> 02:30:59,640
data types in and in Java

2202
02:31:00,680 --> 02:31:03,600
we also have data types in school

2203
02:31:08,040 --> 02:31:12,000
so we have integers

2204
02:31:12,280 --> 02:31:15,160
to store the whole numbers.

2205
02:31:15,160 --> 02:31:17,400
Are you still in math? No,
I just got back.

2206
02:31:17,400 --> 02:31:20,840
I told you I will be back from Mars on
Sunday.

2207
02:31:20,920 --> 02:31:23,280
Right. This is Sunday. I just landed.

2208
02:31:24,360 --> 02:31:27,160
Yes. Yes.

2209
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,960
We also have the decimal data types.

2210
02:31:30,960 --> 02:31:33,360
But you guys don't need to learn because

2211
02:31:35,080 --> 02:31:37,400
you guys
will not be creating these tables.

2212
02:31:37,720 --> 02:31:42,200
You only you will only be fetching
exploding the that those DBS that

2213
02:31:42,200 --> 02:31:47,840
I told you or developers or architects,
they will create big tables.

2214
02:31:47,840 --> 02:31:50,040
They will desire to be data types
and all that.

2215
02:31:50,040 --> 02:31:53,280
But you guys should know

2216
02:31:53,280 --> 02:31:56,040
they do
they do bring girlfriend from Mars.

2217
02:31:56,520 --> 02:31:59,320
I didn't they occurred to Mars.

2218
02:31:59,320 --> 02:32:03,880
She was already here on the left.

2219
02:32:05,160 --> 02:32:09,360
So you guys don't

2220
02:32:09,360 --> 02:32:14,440
want me to be happy somewhere
in this galaxy, in this universe.

2221
02:32:15,520 --> 02:32:21,480
Want to talk with everywhere? This

2222
02:32:24,320 --> 02:32:26,720
and so this lot,

2223
02:32:27,280 --> 02:32:31,560
that data type, it's a little different.

2224
02:32:31,560 --> 02:32:35,080
If we you we can use this locked
that same as string.

2225
02:32:35,080 --> 02:32:39,320
We can put numbers,
special characters, everything.

2226
02:32:39,320 --> 02:32:43,080
But the only difference
is that instead of string database

2227
02:32:43,080 --> 02:32:47,120
guys, they call it what stuff.

2228
02:32:47,120 --> 02:32:49,680
And we can also define the length in here.

2229
02:32:49,680 --> 02:32:51,960
Let's say we want to have a locked out of

2230
02:32:52,120 --> 02:32:56,240
that can only store
15 letters, 20 letters, 30, 45.

2231
02:32:56,240 --> 02:32:58,680
It is up to us in strings.
There is no limit.

2232
02:32:58,680 --> 02:33:03,160
We can store up to billions of characters
but water inside the blackboard

2233
02:33:03,160 --> 02:33:06,760
so we can specify
how many characters want to allow

2234
02:33:06,760 --> 02:33:10,720
and when we will be inserting the data
inside the table.

2235
02:33:11,400 --> 02:33:14,440
And if, let's say we say only ten in here,

2236
02:33:14,520 --> 02:33:18,240
then only ten
will be allowed by insertion.

2237
02:33:19,320 --> 02:33:22,720
And then we have this data that

2238
02:33:22,720 --> 02:33:26,120
I will show you how to write it

2239
02:33:26,120 --> 02:33:29,040
using the data type

2240
02:33:31,560 --> 02:33:33,120
column in database

2241
02:33:33,120 --> 02:33:37,240
table can only accept the one that I type
is very strict rule, obviously.

2242
02:33:38,040 --> 02:33:41,840
Why? Why should I write it in

2243
02:33:43,040 --> 02:33:44,040
two zero?

2244
02:33:44,040 --> 02:33:45,840
One is easier.

2245
02:33:45,840 --> 02:33:48,000
Silva What do you mean by this emoji?

2246
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:51,600
I think 90% of the time
you always post this emoji

2247
02:33:51,720 --> 02:33:54,840
and in the inferential fact

2248
02:33:59,240 --> 02:34:00,320
we have

2249
02:34:01,400 --> 02:34:04,800
the data is killing me.

2250
02:34:04,800 --> 02:34:09,080
You think you should then use a different
emoji if something is killing you?

2251
02:34:09,440 --> 02:34:10,800
I am kind of confused.

2252
02:34:10,800 --> 02:34:13,960
You always use this.

2253
02:34:13,960 --> 02:34:19,120
It's in the Yes, it is your favorite,
but please don't confuse us.

2254
02:34:19,200 --> 02:34:24,120
Who would have
that name Dot in the evening?

2255
02:34:24,120 --> 02:34:27,600
So this is the distinct keyword
that you guys use.

2256
02:34:27,680 --> 02:34:31,720
Already learned.

2257
02:34:31,720 --> 02:34:34,800
All you guys are already
done with the first class

2258
02:34:36,520 --> 02:34:38,040
where column and then

2259
02:34:38,040 --> 02:34:41,360
comparison operator can get to
then less than equal

2260
02:34:41,360 --> 02:34:43,280
to 90 Puerto

2261
02:34:45,240 --> 02:34:47,880
task And then last

2262
02:34:47,880 --> 02:34:50,200
you see you guys how easy is the skill

2263
02:34:50,560 --> 02:34:53,680
that you guys have already already done
with plus one

2264
02:34:57,600 --> 02:35:00,000
No no no we are not done for coding.

2265
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,080
We will learn in another class

2266
02:35:06,840 --> 02:35:07,680
comparison.

2267
02:35:07,680 --> 02:35:10,440
Operators are used to compare objects.

2268
02:35:10,440 --> 02:35:13,320
Conditions
could be numeric based or character

2269
02:35:15,280 --> 02:35:16,480
for the character based.

2270
02:35:16,480 --> 02:35:18,600
We use course

2271
02:35:18,960 --> 02:35:22,560
for numeric miss, we just specify
it is just like that

2272
02:35:23,040 --> 02:35:26,280
character based like bar chart
or data data type.

2273
02:35:26,280 --> 02:35:29,280
We must use single course of key

2274
02:35:33,120 --> 02:35:35,440
logical of all in this class is very easy.

2275
02:35:36,280 --> 02:35:38,560
We can, I think, cover three classes to do

2276
02:35:39,920 --> 02:35:40,880
functions in a skill.

2277
02:35:40,880 --> 02:35:43,640
Yes, it is also very similar. This would

2278
02:35:52,480 --> 02:35:53,640
do no class to that?

2279
02:35:53,640 --> 02:36:00,600
No, I have another class for Tuesday
as well.

2280
02:36:00,600 --> 02:36:03,040
Here, please put the emergency level.

2281
02:36:03,120 --> 02:36:05,640
Please put that in. Good enough.

2282
02:36:05,640 --> 02:36:06,920
Let's cover all the course.

2283
02:36:06,920 --> 02:36:08,800
Oh, I know you guys.

2284
02:36:08,800 --> 02:36:10,680
You guys are so much a grown up.

2285
02:36:10,680 --> 02:36:12,760
You guys are learning so quickly.

2286
02:36:12,960 --> 02:36:19,640
I didn't realize that. Oh,

2287
02:36:21,560 --> 02:36:24,360
let's learn the easy things. So.

2288
02:36:24,880 --> 02:36:28,080
And then we will objects

2289
02:36:32,360 --> 02:36:33,720
select all.

2290
02:36:33,720 --> 02:36:39,960
So if we have to specify multiple
conditions, you see how easy that skill.

2291
02:36:39,960 --> 02:36:42,200
If I am teaching it,

2292
02:36:42,400 --> 02:36:44,560
we can see from

2293
02:36:46,320 --> 02:36:46,920
Sebastian.

2294
02:36:46,920 --> 02:36:50,440
Please,
with all why you made the 80 year old

2295
02:36:51,480 --> 02:36:53,160
man make it ten year old.

2296
02:36:53,160 --> 02:36:56,040
15 year old had

2297
02:36:56,040 --> 02:36:59,680
it looks like they have been coding
without water in the food for

2298
02:36:59,680 --> 02:37:07,240
like one month. It's

2299
02:37:08,680 --> 02:37:09,800
a year.

2300
02:37:09,800 --> 02:37:12,360
And so if we have to

2301
02:37:12,360 --> 02:37:15,880
specify multiple conditions,

2302
02:37:15,880 --> 02:37:18,840
let's say

2303
02:37:18,880 --> 02:37:23,120
if I only want the records

2304
02:37:23,120 --> 02:37:29,360
for which the age is greater than 23

2305
02:37:31,080 --> 02:37:35,160
and age is less than

2306
02:37:36,240 --> 02:37:46,120
28 eight, oh,

2307
02:37:46,800 --> 02:37:50,320
we need to do we're closer to like,
let's look for them all.

2308
02:37:50,320 --> 02:37:51,640
Uppercase

2309
02:37:53,400 --> 02:37:56,400
this one as well.

2310
02:37:56,400 --> 02:37:59,600
So can you guys guess the output

2311
02:37:59,600 --> 02:38:00,520
don't scare him.

2312
02:38:00,520 --> 02:38:04,880
Although if

2313
02:38:11,280 --> 02:38:13,680
yes, then we thank you.

2314
02:38:13,680 --> 02:38:17,360
So between 23

2315
02:38:17,360 --> 02:38:29,640
and 28 right?

2316
02:38:29,640 --> 02:38:30,480
Yeah.

2317
02:38:30,480 --> 02:38:31,920
Only the

2318
02:38:34,480 --> 02:38:34,840
new guys.

2319
02:38:34,840 --> 02:38:42,080
We are the same readers.

2320
02:38:42,080 --> 02:38:47,240
So this is how we specify
multiple conditions.

2321
02:38:47,240 --> 02:38:51,000
Now guys write a few read to

2322
02:38:53,640 --> 02:38:55,920
to create all the records

2323
02:38:55,920 --> 02:38:59,080
for which city is in New York

2324
02:39:00,800 --> 02:39:02,880
and age is 23.

2325
02:39:04,280 --> 02:39:07,040
I should see only those records

2326
02:39:07,040 --> 02:39:11,880
for which city is New York
and under age is 23 and degree for that

2327
02:39:26,960 --> 02:39:28,560
city is in New

2328
02:39:28,560 --> 02:39:32,520
York and age is 23.

2329
02:39:32,520 --> 02:39:36,720
But by the way, we use the
and the keyword.

2330
02:39:37,080 --> 02:39:39,240
If we have to write the under condition.

2331
02:39:39,240 --> 02:39:41,880
It is different from Java

2332
02:39:48,840 --> 02:39:50,120
select

2333
02:39:50,680 --> 02:39:51,480
the divide.

2334
02:39:51,480 --> 02:40:07,400
Also exit
all this period to check the results.

2335
02:40:07,400 --> 02:40:10,600
So where ID is

2336
02:40:10,600 --> 02:40:14,160
equal to 23 and

2337
02:40:17,280 --> 02:40:19,760
60 is equal to

2338
02:40:24,280 --> 02:40:25,680
New York

2339
02:40:28,720 --> 02:40:29,800
and this

2340
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:37,800
region? Yep.

2341
02:40:37,800 --> 02:40:46,000
Do you guys all get the same results?

2342
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:50,280
Is there anyone who is confused
or voting festival?

2343
02:40:50,280 --> 02:40:54,960
Is hard or getting any issues,

2344
02:40:54,960 --> 02:40:58,600
any feedback, suggestion

2345
02:40:59,800 --> 02:41:05,000
or looks good of a

2346
02:41:08,400 --> 02:41:11,680
Then guys write one more query.

2347
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:16,480
Just in which

2348
02:41:21,240 --> 02:41:26,360
select
only those employed for which MP I.D.

2349
02:41:26,360 --> 02:41:28,680
is 120.

2350
02:41:28,680 --> 02:41:33,000
Gender is a male and the last name is Dem

2351
02:41:34,600 --> 02:41:36,560
person in stable name. Yes.

2352
02:41:36,560 --> 02:41:37,880
Get a personally stable name

2353
02:41:40,880 --> 02:41:41,760
guys.

2354
02:41:41,880 --> 02:41:44,440
Last name is jam

2355
02:41:45,480 --> 02:41:50,040
gen that is male and employee I.D.

2356
02:41:50,040 --> 02:42:22,120
is 120.

2357
02:42:22,120 --> 02:42:24,280
Last name is

2358
02:42:32,040 --> 02:42:32,720
equal,

2359
02:42:33,480 --> 02:42:36,760
gender is new

2360
02:42:38,400 --> 02:42:44,160
and the

2361
02:42:44,160 --> 02:42:47,160
and the I.D. is

2362
02:42:56,160 --> 02:43:01,800
MJ and three legs and yes.

2363
02:43:01,800 --> 02:43:07,080
Do you guys get the same results?

2364
02:43:07,080 --> 02:43:09,960
Most of the

2365
02:43:15,360 --> 02:43:18,600
so this is how we combine

2366
02:43:18,600 --> 02:43:21,440
multiple conditions
with the help of an operator

2367
02:43:22,520 --> 02:43:24,320
is it clear. Right.

2368
02:43:24,840 --> 02:43:27,240
We can use the order condition as well.

2369
02:43:27,760 --> 02:43:31,360
For example, can you guys first do that

2370
02:43:31,480 --> 02:43:36,480
for the records for which are ages

2371
02:43:36,480 --> 02:43:39,680
23 or

2372
02:43:39,680 --> 02:43:41,760
employ RTD is

2373
02:43:41,920 --> 02:43:46,640
120, age

2374
02:43:46,720 --> 02:43:51,040
is 23 or employed is 120.

2375
02:43:51,040 --> 02:43:54,360
So if one of the conditions is fulfilled,

2376
02:43:54,360 --> 02:43:57,920
I should say that record

2377
02:44:06,120 --> 02:44:09,040
you select

2378
02:44:10,120 --> 02:44:13,360
all strong

2379
02:44:14,320 --> 02:44:16,120
for some

2380
02:44:16,520 --> 02:44:18,000
where

2381
02:44:19,040 --> 02:44:22,560
it is 23 or

2382
02:44:23,880 --> 02:44:26,160
medium we already use,

2383
02:44:27,160 --> 02:44:28,640
we want to do right.

2384
02:44:28,640 --> 02:44:35,960
This is our with all conditions.

2385
02:44:35,960 --> 02:44:41,520
So you will see all the rec or adverse
for which I the age is 23

2386
02:44:42,720 --> 02:44:45,840
or employ ID is 120.

2387
02:44:46,160 --> 02:44:49,280
Well well why do I see 150 guys?

2388
02:44:49,280 --> 02:44:52,040
Am I getting the correct result
so they get 150

2389
02:44:53,760 --> 02:44:55,320
for the employed.

2390
02:44:55,320 --> 02:44:56,680
Yes. Why?

2391
02:44:56,680 --> 02:44:59,160
Because it is 23. Right.

2392
02:44:59,160 --> 02:45:02,080
So even if one condition

2393
02:45:02,080 --> 02:45:07,920
met, we will see that contact.

2394
02:45:07,920 --> 02:45:10,920
Okay, it looks next.

2395
02:45:10,960 --> 02:45:14,480
Let's write that query
in which let's combine or

2396
02:45:14,480 --> 02:45:17,800
and the condition right.

2397
02:45:17,800 --> 02:45:22,200
So give me the records for which

2398
02:45:23,240 --> 02:45:27,000
gender is female and 23

2399
02:45:27,600 --> 02:45:30,120
or MP ID 100

2400
02:45:32,440 --> 02:45:35,280
gender is female, F

2401
02:45:35,280 --> 02:45:38,120
and age is 23 or

2402
02:45:39,280 --> 02:45:41,440
MP Ione is 120

2403
02:46:15,840 --> 02:46:18,440
Gender is being in L

2404
02:46:21,840 --> 02:46:23,520
and age is printed

2405
02:46:23,520 --> 02:46:26,880
three or MP ID is one

2406
02:46:26,880 --> 02:46:39,560
2013 rules.

2407
02:46:39,560 --> 02:46:40,520
Right.

2408
02:46:40,720 --> 02:46:45,800
So let's test
if we are getting the proper document.

2409
02:46:45,800 --> 02:46:52,320
Gender is
male ID is 23 MP it is one quantity

2410
02:46:54,160 --> 02:46:56,840
then that is female and 23.

2411
02:46:58,080 --> 02:47:00,280
So this condition is one,

2412
02:47:00,280 --> 02:47:03,120
so we don't need to hear about
the other one.

2413
02:47:03,920 --> 02:47:06,120
All looks guys.

2414
02:47:06,800 --> 02:47:09,680
So logic works in here

2415
02:47:10,200 --> 02:47:14,840
either this condition is true
combined as a whole or this condition.

2416
02:47:14,840 --> 02:47:18,440
So if you want to be more specific,
if you are not sure

2417
02:47:18,440 --> 02:47:20,360
you can use these

2418
02:47:21,600 --> 02:47:23,640
brackets as the number.

2419
02:47:23,640 --> 02:47:24,680
If let's say you are

2420
02:47:24,680 --> 02:47:28,080
if something is confusing you,
you can use the parentheses as well.

2421
02:47:28,440 --> 02:47:31,000
Yeah.

2422
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:36,160
To prioritize things.

2423
02:47:36,160 --> 02:47:39,960
This is a good

2424
02:47:41,640 --> 02:47:42,720
answer to your question.

2425
02:47:42,720 --> 02:47:43,600
Number

2426
02:47:45,080 --> 02:47:48,120
because it changes the result
and I can tweak it

2427
02:47:48,320 --> 02:47:54,720
and any way I want is use parentheses
if you want to tweak it.

2428
02:47:54,720 --> 02:47:57,080
How to gender Only if

2429
02:47:59,280 --> 02:48:00,760
you don't want the other conditions.

2430
02:48:00,760 --> 02:48:01,280
And it's

2431
02:48:02,600 --> 02:48:04,400
only gender. If

2432
02:48:05,240 --> 02:48:07,920
then remove the other conditions.

2433
02:48:07,920 --> 02:48:11,480
So like this.

2434
02:48:11,840 --> 02:48:14,360
So only now you will only see that if

2435
02:48:16,320 --> 02:48:18,400
only the ladies

2436
02:48:18,400 --> 02:48:20,560
only gender different

2437
02:48:21,960 --> 02:48:23,480
and age

2438
02:48:25,720 --> 02:48:28,720
so f and 23 age or D,

2439
02:48:29,680 --> 02:48:34,560
but always for gender.

2440
02:48:34,560 --> 02:48:37,040
Oh, you don't want to see the.

2441
02:48:38,560 --> 02:48:40,680
So if you execute this beauty

2442
02:48:44,520 --> 02:48:47,520
you get some males this one right.

2443
02:48:48,360 --> 02:48:51,320
You don't want those. Yes.

2444
02:48:51,840 --> 02:48:53,600
There are their condition in here as well.

2445
02:48:53,600 --> 02:48:56,800
This is one of the solution
you can modify, be good in any way

2446
02:48:58,120 --> 02:49:01,480
and and put that condition in here.

2447
02:49:01,480 --> 02:49:01,960
That's

2448
02:49:03,240 --> 02:49:05,400
only ladies not interested in men.

2449
02:49:05,920 --> 02:49:07,360
No. Choose

2450
02:49:10,280 --> 02:49:11,800
bringing those 120

2451
02:49:11,800 --> 02:49:14,520
is both of the only only female.

2452
02:49:16,640 --> 02:49:17,960
Or you can modify it

2453
02:49:17,960 --> 02:49:22,680
excluding other way as well.

2454
02:49:22,680 --> 02:49:24,800
They are not the same assignment.

2455
02:49:24,880 --> 02:49:30,600
What is the difference between select
all from persons with gender F and age 20

2456
02:49:32,160 --> 02:49:33,960
or MP B?

2457
02:49:33,960 --> 02:49:37,640
It should be the same,
but it is not assignment.

2458
02:49:37,640 --> 02:49:41,000
Why should we do same in the above duty?

2459
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:44,040
You are specifying
employer ID in the below query you are.

2460
02:49:44,400 --> 02:49:46,440
You are not specifying ID.

2461
02:49:46,440 --> 02:49:47,640
So this is how it works.

2462
02:49:47,640 --> 02:49:51,000
Guys, let me explain to you.

2463
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:53,520
I hope it will get better.

2464
02:49:53,520 --> 02:49:55,440
So what skill will do?

2465
02:49:55,440 --> 02:50:00,680
It will pick all the rules one by one.

2466
02:50:00,680 --> 02:50:02,440
So it will pick this first rule.

2467
02:50:02,440 --> 02:50:03,440
It will check.

2468
02:50:03,440 --> 02:50:05,520
Okay, so I forgot to specify it again.

2469
02:50:05,520 --> 02:50:06,600
The ref does it.

2470
02:50:06,600 --> 02:50:09,560
Does it have gender f the first rule? No

2471
02:50:10,640 --> 02:50:11,800
it does not have the gender.

2472
02:50:11,800 --> 02:50:17,720
If that means even if one condition
is not correct, that means

2473
02:50:18,800 --> 02:50:20,200
we don't to check it.

2474
02:50:20,200 --> 02:50:22,680
The other condition will save it.

2475
02:50:22,720 --> 02:50:24,720
Save mpi d12.

2476
02:50:24,720 --> 02:50:26,920
Does it have we want?

2477
02:50:27,080 --> 02:50:32,280
No, it will exclude this rule
from the desired reserve set.

2478
02:50:32,640 --> 02:50:34,720
Then it will pick the next rule.

2479
02:50:34,720 --> 02:50:36,000
It will again check.

2480
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:38,880
Does that rule qualify all the conditions?

2481
02:50:38,880 --> 02:50:42,960
If it qualifies, all the conditions
that rule will be included in your output.

2482
02:50:42,960 --> 02:50:45,560
If not that, that will be ignored as well.

2483
02:50:46,080 --> 02:50:47,680
One by one.

2484
02:50:47,680 --> 02:50:52,480
These conditions will be applied
on all the rules

2485
02:50:52,880 --> 02:50:58,040
and only those rules which qualified
the conditions will be returned

2486
02:50:58,040 --> 02:51:03,080
in here, female

2487
02:51:03,080 --> 02:51:08,400
and age 23,
or if there are no brackets in my acuity.

2488
02:51:08,400 --> 02:51:10,680
So does the automatic. And then

2489
02:51:11,800 --> 02:51:14,000
then the priority is given to end

2490
02:51:15,320 --> 02:51:17,360
and then we apply the order.

2491
02:51:17,840 --> 02:51:20,760
If you want to ask this,
as we have the rules in MED,

2492
02:51:21,200 --> 02:51:23,840
we follow the DBM or whatever
that is called.

2493
02:51:23,840 --> 02:51:25,120
The multiplication happens

2494
02:51:25,120 --> 02:51:28,920
first multiplication and division,
then are plus and minus.

2495
02:51:29,200 --> 02:51:35,000
So same is here, but
I don't want you to go into those details

2496
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:38,760
and confuse yourself if you are always,

2497
02:51:38,760 --> 02:51:43,440
always use these parentheses and priority
will be given to that condition.

2498
02:51:44,080 --> 02:51:47,840
If you want to prioritize
something, always use parentheses.

2499
02:51:47,840 --> 02:51:50,440
Okay. Forget about how it works.

2500
02:51:50,440 --> 02:51:52,200
Are all rules

2501
02:51:54,560 --> 02:51:54,880
okay.

2502
02:51:55,680 --> 02:51:58,160
It seemed like I forgot to list us a lot.

2503
02:51:58,160 --> 02:52:02,840
It does not want we want to go break or.

2504
02:52:02,840 --> 02:52:05,320
You guys need to break.
Well, I'm not tired.

2505
02:52:05,400 --> 02:52:07,520
I don't know why you guys get tired.

2506
02:52:07,520 --> 02:52:09,800
You guys know I was traveling all day.

2507
02:52:10,120 --> 02:52:13,280
I was super,
super tired before your class.

2508
02:52:13,280 --> 02:52:15,960
But when I started the class, I am not

2509
02:52:17,600 --> 02:52:19,240
tired anymore.

2510
02:52:19,240 --> 02:52:20,960
But we need to understand logic.

2511
02:52:20,960 --> 02:52:25,920
So, like math, ESL, X?

2512
02:52:25,920 --> 02:52:27,040
Yes, guys.

2513
02:52:27,040 --> 02:52:29,880
Okay, guys, let's have a break.

2514
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:32,440
And after the break, please

2515
02:52:33,360 --> 02:52:36,400
make be accounts on on Google

2516
02:52:36,800 --> 02:52:39,600
so that you guys know

2517
02:52:39,600 --> 02:52:42,480
what are the things that

2518
02:52:42,480 --> 02:52:45,240
might not work on other databases

2519
02:52:47,600 --> 02:52:50,480
15 minutes are enough guys.

2520
02:52:50,520 --> 02:52:52,760
Okay, let's

2521
02:52:53,880 --> 02:52:58,200
let let's have five more minutes.

2522
02:52:58,200 --> 02:53:01,760
So those who don't know,
because some for some of you,

2523
02:53:01,800 --> 02:53:04,280
the Internet was down.

2524
02:53:05,160 --> 02:53:07,600
You guys have to go to Oracle live.

2525
02:53:07,600 --> 02:53:12,200
You guys have type Oracle live on Google,

2526
02:53:12,200 --> 02:53:16,080
then click on the first link.

2527
02:53:16,080 --> 02:53:19,880
No harm, not on Google, on Oracle life,

2528
02:53:20,640 --> 02:53:23,040
and then

2529
02:53:26,640 --> 02:53:28,760
click in here and click on Ask about.

2530
02:53:28,760 --> 02:53:31,720
It will ask you for the username.

2531
02:53:31,720 --> 02:53:35,280
You have to sign up first
if you don't have the username

2532
02:53:35,440 --> 02:53:38,280
if you guys already have,
you guys don't need to do anything.

2533
02:53:38,280 --> 02:53:39,840
Enjoy your break.

2534
02:53:39,840 --> 02:53:43,680
The others who do not remember username
or don't have it, please create

2535
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:44,960
new username.

2536
02:53:44,960 --> 02:53:47,680
We will be using this after the break.

2537
02:53:49,320 --> 02:53:50,560
All good.

2538
02:53:51,040 --> 02:53:53,280
You When are you coming back?

2539
02:53:53,280 --> 02:53:56,680
At 205

2540
02:53:57,480 --> 02:53:59,880
and will be notified

2541
02:53:59,880 --> 02:54:07,000
once you are looking good.

2542
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:10,200
Can we go on break or is there

2543
02:54:10,200 --> 02:54:13,240
someone who is having

2544
02:54:13,240 --> 02:54:24,600
any issues? Yes.

2545
02:54:24,600 --> 02:54:29,000
Break till 205 so that all of you
can make those accounts.

2546
02:54:30,320 --> 02:54:30,880
Yeah.

2547
02:54:30,880 --> 02:54:34,440
If strong enough.

2548
02:54:34,440 --> 02:54:37,880
Do you guys want to turn

2549
02:54:37,880 --> 02:54:38,320
a Yes?

2550
02:54:38,320 --> 02:54:42,120
Alexia, look, look.

2551
02:54:42,120 --> 02:54:44,880
All advice is backed by tools zero five

2552
02:54:45,840 --> 02:55:01,360
And remind me about problem.

2553
02:55:01,360 --> 02:55:04,720
Have you guys made

2554
02:55:04,720 --> 02:55:07,000
the account on

2555
02:55:08,040 --> 02:55:18,680
Oracle website?

2556
02:55:18,680 --> 02:55:23,160
Okay, so the schema for this website.

2557
02:55:23,160 --> 02:55:26,440
So I want to know
how many tables are there?

2558
02:55:26,640 --> 02:55:29,800
What kind of columns those tables have?

2559
02:55:30,080 --> 02:55:41,920
Can you guys tell me on
which links should I click from here?

2560
02:55:41,920 --> 02:55:44,360
The schema one. Right.

2561
02:55:44,360 --> 02:55:46,000
So if I take on schema,

2562
02:55:47,160 --> 02:55:49,040
right.

2563
02:55:49,040 --> 02:55:52,280
So there
are many different schema in here,

2564
02:55:52,560 --> 02:55:55,680
but we will be working with this

2565
02:55:55,680 --> 02:56:01,560
at Java Human Resource.

2566
02:56:01,560 --> 02:56:04,600
So we have the ADD

2567
02:56:04,600 --> 02:56:07,240
underscore job underscore history table

2568
02:56:07,840 --> 02:56:10,680
table departments, Table employs tables

2569
02:56:11,040 --> 02:56:14,280
so you guys can find out
about all the tables from here.

2570
02:56:14,520 --> 02:56:15,200
Right.

2571
02:56:15,360 --> 02:56:19,440
And so ask you all my skill we right

2572
02:56:21,240 --> 02:56:23,480
the use

2573
02:56:23,880 --> 02:56:26,040
this statement in Oracle

2574
02:56:27,160 --> 02:56:29,760
we just tried

2575
02:56:30,120 --> 02:56:32,560
at Java DOT

2576
02:56:32,560 --> 02:56:35,440
employs employs or employs

2577
02:56:35,520 --> 02:56:37,440
yes employs

2578
02:56:45,240 --> 02:56:47,760
and if we execute

2579
02:56:47,760 --> 02:56:51,000
by clicking on this this one.

2580
02:56:51,600 --> 02:56:55,600
So before every table
you have write at charter dot

2581
02:56:56,120 --> 02:57:02,440
and choose how we specify
which schema we want to use.

2582
02:57:02,440 --> 02:57:15,280
Do you guys see this data in here?

2583
02:57:15,280 --> 02:57:18,520
Okay, so now think about this guide
and tell me if

2584
02:57:18,520 --> 02:57:20,040
I see

2585
02:57:21,600 --> 02:57:23,000
last name

2586
02:57:25,880 --> 02:57:29,240
is equal to double course.

2587
02:57:30,080 --> 02:57:33,120
And if I say Stephen

2588
02:57:33,120 --> 02:57:36,120
in here, will I get any results?

2589
02:57:36,800 --> 02:57:47,680
It looks much cleaner.

2590
02:57:47,680 --> 02:57:52,080
I will get an error.

2591
02:57:52,080 --> 02:57:52,920
Okay.

2592
02:57:52,920 --> 02:57:55,920
If I try to use

2593
02:57:56,560 --> 02:57:59,000
double, of course, in

2594
02:58:01,080 --> 02:58:02,200
Oracle.

2595
02:58:02,200 --> 02:58:05,040
Sorry I'm missing. We are close as well.

2596
02:58:05,160 --> 02:58:06,840
Let me repeat it

2597
02:58:10,320 --> 02:58:16,360
to double quotes in here.

2598
02:58:16,360 --> 02:58:19,040
So it says invalid identifier.

2599
02:58:20,120 --> 02:58:22,800
But if I use a single course

2600
02:58:30,240 --> 02:58:32,160
this time the query is correct.

2601
02:58:32,160 --> 02:58:36,120
But I get no data. Why?

2602
02:58:36,120 --> 02:58:37,640
Because inside.

2603
02:58:37,640 --> 02:58:42,480
Because Oracle database is case sensitive,

2604
02:58:43,200 --> 02:58:48,720
so I must write it in the proper case

2605
02:58:48,720 --> 02:58:51,600
if I want to get that back

2606
02:58:54,960 --> 02:58:56,360
was the first step,

2607
02:58:56,360 --> 02:59:00,200
but a lot lower case for this one

2608
02:59:02,400 --> 02:59:07,160
creature.

2609
02:59:07,160 --> 02:59:11,800
Okay.

2610
02:59:11,800 --> 02:59:14,880
Oh, the first name right

2611
02:59:15,240 --> 02:59:26,120
was not the last name.

2612
02:59:26,120 --> 02:59:32,120
So I get the results
if I change it to all uppercase

2613
02:59:34,320 --> 02:59:36,320
and if I execute security

2614
02:59:36,480 --> 02:59:40,200
again, you know that.

2615
02:59:40,400 --> 02:59:46,320
All right, So for the Oracle database,

2616
02:59:46,320 --> 02:59:49,800
the things inside the double course,

2617
02:59:50,280 --> 02:59:52,320
they are case sensitive,

2618
02:59:52,960 --> 02:59:56,840
but the column names
the square and everything.

2619
02:59:56,840 --> 02:59:58,840
They are case insensitive.

2620
02:59:58,840 --> 03:00:01,400
How do you connect your database
to Oracle?

2621
03:00:01,400 --> 03:00:03,840
It is already connected in here.

2622
03:00:03,840 --> 03:00:06,000
Select we a capital.

2623
03:00:06,000 --> 03:00:08,040
So as a best practice,

2624
03:00:09,520 --> 03:00:13,640
when you write something
inside the boards,

2625
03:00:14,200 --> 03:00:17,200
make sure you specify the proper case.

2626
03:00:17,640 --> 03:00:20,760
Also, don't use double course because on

2627
03:00:20,760 --> 03:00:23,520
some of the database is double
quotes are not supported.

2628
03:00:24,040 --> 03:00:27,760
You see if check it on the my school

2629
03:00:31,240 --> 03:00:32,560
and if I change it

2630
03:00:32,560 --> 03:00:50,160
to double course, I still get the reverse

2631
03:00:50,520 --> 03:00:53,280
double code single course don't matter on

2632
03:00:54,840 --> 03:00:58,080
my sequel activities.

2633
03:00:58,080 --> 03:01:03,520
But for the Oracle one, if I use

2634
03:01:04,600 --> 03:01:05,000
double

2635
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:12,640
course, I will get an ask.

2636
03:01:13,040 --> 03:01:13,680
Okay.

2637
03:01:13,920 --> 03:01:19,600
So as a best practice, yes, sometimes
things might work on their database,

2638
03:01:20,160 --> 03:01:23,880
but we should always try to follow
the best practice.

2639
03:01:25,640 --> 03:01:28,840
So best practice is your course
and inside the course

2640
03:01:28,840 --> 03:01:42,720
to specify the proper case.

2641
03:01:42,720 --> 03:01:47,040
But there is no exception
to integrate the add a different

2642
03:01:47,560 --> 03:01:50,440
databases,
give you different errors, you know,

2643
03:01:51,200 --> 03:01:55,760
so it will not be helpful
even if some of the databases be true.

2644
03:01:55,760 --> 03:01:59,640
The error will

2645
03:02:05,200 --> 03:02:14,400
all good guys.

2646
03:02:14,400 --> 03:02:30,080
How can you add common skill on Oracle?

2647
03:02:30,080 --> 03:02:33,320
But on Oracle, the command, the hash is

2648
03:02:33,360 --> 03:02:36,520
a hash also does not work for comments.

2649
03:02:36,520 --> 03:02:42,240
We have to use these underscores.

2650
03:02:42,240 --> 03:02:44,480
So I will try to teach you both things

2651
03:02:45,480 --> 03:02:49,600
which might work on school
or other databases.

2652
03:02:49,600 --> 03:02:52,600
But at the same time
I will also teach you the best practice.

2653
03:02:52,600 --> 03:02:56,440
Okay, so that you guys don't get confused
if your company uses

2654
03:02:56,440 --> 03:02:57,640
a different backup base.

2655
03:02:58,960 --> 03:03:01,920
So try both the things I told you about.

2656
03:03:01,920 --> 03:03:08,160
Be not equal to symbol using those angle
brackets and not equal to sign.

2657
03:03:08,520 --> 03:03:11,720
So some of the databases,
they might support both of them.

2658
03:03:12,120 --> 03:03:16,560
Some of them
they might export only one of them.

2659
03:03:16,560 --> 03:03:20,840
That's
why we have multiple things in here.

2660
03:03:20,840 --> 03:03:21,440
Well,

2661
03:03:23,520 --> 03:03:28,880
let me check what is next.

2662
03:03:28,880 --> 03:03:29,480
Okay.

2663
03:03:29,880 --> 03:03:34,120
So next is a new clause

2664
03:03:34,120 --> 03:03:39,280
that is called order by clause.

2665
03:03:39,280 --> 03:03:43,680
Mine shows
Oracle database is a little trickier. One

2666
03:03:53,480 --> 03:03:55,720
This is sure to be capital Mohammed

2667
03:03:56,640 --> 03:03:59,080
the se of Stephen should be capital

2668
03:03:59,680 --> 03:04:01,920
and that's why you see all our data.

2669
03:04:03,080 --> 03:04:03,720
All right.

2670
03:04:03,720 --> 03:04:06,120
So what is this order by clause?

2671
03:04:06,760 --> 03:04:09,600
So I told you guys that

2672
03:04:09,600 --> 03:04:11,880
when we fetch the data, when we stored

2673
03:04:12,000 --> 03:04:15,160
that database,
there is no guarantee of order.

2674
03:04:15,960 --> 03:04:16,440
Okay?

2675
03:04:17,480 --> 03:04:19,560
So if there is no guarantee

2676
03:04:19,560 --> 03:04:22,880
and I want the specific order,

2677
03:04:23,120 --> 03:04:26,400
how can I do that?

2678
03:04:26,400 --> 03:04:30,160
So let's say I want all the names

2679
03:04:30,160 --> 03:04:34,040
in ascending order.

2680
03:04:34,040 --> 03:04:36,600
So I will say

2681
03:04:38,280 --> 03:04:41,000
select all from

2682
03:04:42,400 --> 03:04:43,960
our sun

2683
03:04:44,880 --> 03:04:48,240
and order this data by

2684
03:04:50,680 --> 03:05:07,920
first name. Oops.

2685
03:05:07,920 --> 03:05:10,240
So now you guys will notice that

2686
03:05:11,720 --> 03:05:15,720
all the data this time has been sorted

2687
03:05:15,720 --> 03:05:18,240
in ascending order

2688
03:05:19,440 --> 03:05:20,680
by this first name.

2689
03:05:20,680 --> 03:05:26,240
Do you guys get the same results
sorted Data? Yes.

2690
03:05:26,480 --> 03:05:29,040
No, we have been numeric order as well,

2691
03:05:30,560 --> 03:05:33,600
so by default the order

2692
03:05:33,600 --> 03:05:38,280
by clause will solve the data
in ascending order.

2693
03:05:39,480 --> 03:05:41,600
But let's see

2694
03:05:41,600 --> 03:05:45,640
if you want it in a descending order.

2695
03:05:45,640 --> 03:05:50,520
You can also specify that
by writing this DC

2696
03:05:57,560 --> 03:05:58,600
So now you will see

2697
03:05:58,600 --> 03:06:02,160
all the data has been sorted
in descending order order

2698
03:06:11,160 --> 03:06:12,760
and you guys can

2699
03:06:12,760 --> 03:06:17,040
also do this.

2700
03:06:17,040 --> 03:06:20,440
You guys can start

2701
03:06:21,880 --> 03:06:46,560
by more than one column.

2702
03:06:46,560 --> 03:06:49,200
So now what will happen?

2703
03:06:50,960 --> 03:06:53,840
Sorry, what is descending
order means no order.

2704
03:06:53,920 --> 03:06:56,520
Descending order.

2705
03:06:56,520 --> 03:07:00,240
Let's say if ascending is one,
two, three, four, five,

2706
03:07:00,240 --> 03:07:03,480
six, descending will be six, five, four,
three, two, one.

2707
03:07:04,520 --> 03:07:06,000
Reverse of ascending.

2708
03:07:06,000 --> 03:07:10,240
It does not mean non,
it means opposite of descending.

2709
03:07:10,480 --> 03:07:15,120
It's the other way
around, lower to higher.

2710
03:07:15,120 --> 03:07:17,360
In case of numbers

2711
03:07:17,360 --> 03:07:19,560
it is ascending higher to lower.

2712
03:07:19,640 --> 03:07:25,200
If it is descending, four numbers.

2713
03:07:25,200 --> 03:07:28,920
So when we put two columns

2714
03:07:29,800 --> 03:07:33,000
now, what will happen if?

2715
03:07:33,000 --> 03:07:36,240
We have the same value for the

2716
03:07:37,640 --> 03:07:43,440
first column.

2717
03:07:43,440 --> 03:07:46,880
Let me check to give you ample

2718
03:07:47,960 --> 03:08:07,640
if we have one.

2719
03:08:07,640 --> 03:08:18,560
You guys don't need to follow this one.

2720
03:08:18,560 --> 03:08:35,760
Even if you try,
you will not be able to do that.

2721
03:08:35,760 --> 03:08:38,320
I am sorry.
I forgot what is descending for.

2722
03:08:38,320 --> 03:09:06,600
Can you guys tell now
what is descending for?

2723
03:09:06,600 --> 03:09:11,640
Let me make it.

2724
03:09:11,640 --> 03:09:14,000
We have to set and flag

2725
03:10:00,920 --> 03:10:02,040
went to the roof with the

2726
03:10:02,040 --> 03:10:05,720
ascending coming down from
the roof is descending. Yes.

2727
03:10:05,720 --> 03:10:10,040
And if you still don't understand,
you can try jumping from doodle, right.

2728
03:10:10,080 --> 03:10:14,280
You know,

2729
03:10:14,280 --> 03:10:17,760
then you will definitely understand

2730
03:10:23,360 --> 03:10:24,880
and feel it. Yes.

2731
03:10:24,880 --> 03:10:26,040
Well, so

2732
03:10:28,080 --> 03:10:29,400
of the.

2733
03:10:29,400 --> 03:10:30,240
I'm just kidding.

2734
03:10:30,240 --> 03:10:36,640
Please don't try it at your home.

2735
03:10:36,640 --> 03:10:39,320
But you might learn it

2736
03:10:39,320 --> 03:10:40,680
in heavens.

2737
03:10:40,680 --> 03:10:42,080
Well, what is ascending?

2738
03:10:42,080 --> 03:10:44,600
And this actually is

2739
03:10:46,360 --> 03:10:47,440
you, not you.

2740
03:10:47,440 --> 03:10:50,400
That is

2741
03:11:19,160 --> 03:11:22,080
for the first name.

2742
03:11:22,080 --> 03:11:25,760
I should change the last

2743
03:11:26,640 --> 03:11:29,640
mind.

2744
03:11:29,640 --> 03:11:32,400
You see next, what happens

2745
03:11:32,400 --> 03:11:34,680
when you have all the permissions

2746
03:11:50,400 --> 03:11:53,040
for ascending order or and the

2747
03:11:57,000 --> 03:12:01,200
many cities enjoying their school?

2748
03:12:01,200 --> 03:12:08,400
I wish we have the same lessons
in the university,

2749
03:12:08,400 --> 03:12:10,600
but there may be a contradiction there.

2750
03:12:10,600 --> 03:12:17,160
When you jump, you expect to descend,
but you may ascend to have.

2751
03:12:17,160 --> 03:12:21,560
Yes, here you are right.

2752
03:12:21,560 --> 03:12:22,800
It's relative

2753
03:12:26,160 --> 03:12:26,400
rule.

2754
03:12:26,400 --> 03:12:28,120
Who ask about descending.

2755
03:12:28,120 --> 03:12:31,320
Is it clear
or you want me to further explain

2756
03:12:31,320 --> 03:12:38,240
it? No.

2757
03:12:38,280 --> 03:12:40,320
Now let it clear like this. Descending.

2758
03:12:40,320 --> 03:12:49,880
And what is descending?

2759
03:12:49,880 --> 03:12:50,520
It's clear.

2760
03:12:50,520 --> 03:12:54,960
I just stepped out for a minute.

2761
03:12:54,960 --> 03:12:57,720
So, guys, when we specify

2762
03:12:58,440 --> 03:13:01,440
multiple columns in order by clause.

2763
03:13:02,800 --> 03:13:05,320
So what you will do,

2764
03:13:05,320 --> 03:13:09,920
the first priority will be given
to the first column that we specify.

2765
03:13:10,320 --> 03:13:14,040
So all the data will first be sorted
based on the first names.

2766
03:13:14,040 --> 03:13:17,280
But if the first name is same,

2767
03:13:18,360 --> 03:13:22,600
then the second priority is given
to the last name you see.

2768
03:13:22,600 --> 03:13:31,280
In the last name we see jam first
and then after that.

2769
03:13:31,280 --> 03:13:35,520
So this is how we can use multiple columns
and so fast that I will be sorted

2770
03:13:35,520 --> 03:13:37,200
based on first column.

2771
03:13:37,200 --> 03:13:40,640
If the first column duplicate
that are same data.

2772
03:13:40,880 --> 03:13:45,480
So skill cannot decide which Sara

2773
03:13:45,520 --> 03:13:49,760
it should put first, then
it will decide to based on the last name.

2774
03:13:49,760 --> 03:13:51,440
Because this is the second column,

2775
03:13:51,440 --> 03:13:54,600
we can specify three columns
for any number of columns.

2776
03:13:55,080 --> 03:13:57,240
Then the skill will give the better.

2777
03:13:57,480 --> 03:13:59,120
The first column,
second and third, fourth.

2778
03:13:59,120 --> 03:14:00,360
And like this.

2779
03:14:00,360 --> 03:14:03,760
Is it clear, guys, how specifying
multiple columns

2780
03:14:03,760 --> 03:14:11,360
work?

2781
03:14:11,360 --> 03:14:14,200
Let me check if we can do this.

2782
03:14:14,360 --> 03:14:20,840
Maybe.

2783
03:14:20,840 --> 03:14:25,920
Yes, we can also do this now.

2784
03:14:25,920 --> 03:14:29,280
The data is first
started in ascending order

2785
03:14:31,280 --> 03:14:33,000
for the first name

2786
03:14:33,000 --> 03:14:37,040
and in descending order for the last name
you see.

2787
03:14:37,040 --> 03:14:38,040
So Zoom.

2788
03:14:38,040 --> 03:14:40,280
It should be on the Serbian.

2789
03:14:40,280 --> 03:14:42,240
But now it is on the first.

2790
03:14:42,240 --> 03:14:44,040
Is it funny to ask the question?

2791
03:14:44,040 --> 03:14:46,680
The time I stepped out,
you wrote that line.

2792
03:14:46,680 --> 03:14:48,520
That's why I asked for the.

2793
03:14:48,520 --> 03:14:50,200
No, no, no, no.

2794
03:14:50,200 --> 03:14:51,720
It's completely

2795
03:14:52,000 --> 03:14:54,640
because someone already
asked the same question.

2796
03:14:54,640 --> 03:14:56,800
So first I explained.
Then someone asked the question.

2797
03:14:56,800 --> 03:14:58,440
Then you repeated that question.

2798
03:14:58,440 --> 03:15:01,120
So I thought, you guys are not getting it.

2799
03:15:01,120 --> 03:15:03,600
I didn't know you were out for a minute.

2800
03:15:03,840 --> 03:15:07,680
That's why everyone was explaining it
in so much depth.

2801
03:15:09,120 --> 03:15:11,360
No, no, it's never funny.

2802
03:15:11,360 --> 03:15:17,560
Even if you guys think the questions
are dumb, you guys can still ask.

2803
03:15:17,560 --> 03:15:21,360
And it's always don't don't mind my jokes

2804
03:15:21,360 --> 03:15:25,280
for everyone else do exist just so that
we can have some humor as well.

2805
03:15:25,560 --> 03:15:27,720
Otherwise classes will be so dry.

2806
03:15:28,600 --> 03:15:29,320
You guys will

2807
03:15:30,960 --> 03:15:33,600
feel every minute of it, right?

2808
03:15:33,600 --> 03:15:34,560
I know.

2809
03:15:34,560 --> 03:15:35,680
I have my lectures.

2810
03:15:35,680 --> 03:15:38,000
Are just one hour and 30 minutes

2811
03:15:38,240 --> 03:15:41,960
and literally I can feel a single minute
of my leg today.

2812
03:15:42,000 --> 03:15:44,520
It's like this is my profession
that is teaching

2813
03:15:45,560 --> 03:15:45,960
nothing.

2814
03:15:45,960 --> 03:15:50,760
Makes sense.

2815
03:15:50,760 --> 03:15:54,280
Okay, so guys,
you see why this time when we had

2816
03:15:54,480 --> 03:15:58,240
both taught us in the first name
why the exam was

2817
03:15:58,720 --> 03:16:02,040
and Jan was second,

2818
03:16:02,040 --> 03:16:06,000
we that have on some classes

2819
03:16:06,200 --> 03:16:08,240
now you guys know how to avoid that

2820
03:16:10,920 --> 03:16:15,680
so we can start on ascending order

2821
03:16:15,840 --> 03:16:21,880
based on one column
and descending order on the column.

2822
03:16:21,880 --> 03:16:25,160
But you guys will not be needing it in the

2823
03:16:25,600 --> 03:16:27,880
this much depth.

2824
03:16:28,480 --> 03:16:30,000
So it's okay.

2825
03:16:30,000 --> 03:16:32,280
Just if you don't understand us.

2826
03:16:32,280 --> 03:16:34,320
All right, can you guys now?

2827
03:16:35,720 --> 03:16:37,200
Okay, so I want the

2828
03:16:37,200 --> 03:16:41,800
data from this table
so that the smaller I.B.

2829
03:16:41,840 --> 03:16:44,640
is first,
and then I have the great variety.

2830
03:16:44,640 --> 03:16:47,840
So I don't want this
that nine is after 19.

2831
03:16:48,280 --> 03:16:50,800
Can you guys write the query to do that

2832
03:16:52,440 --> 03:16:54,720
so that ideas are in

2833
03:16:55,040 --> 03:16:58,600
an increasing order?

2834
03:16:58,600 --> 03:17:00,360
What did I do this time?

2835
03:17:00,360 --> 03:17:03,600
Again, think

2836
03:17:05,320 --> 03:17:06,720
Can you guys write acuity

2837
03:17:06,720 --> 03:17:10,920
so that all the data is in increasing

2838
03:17:10,920 --> 03:17:40,440
order of the ideas?

2839
03:17:40,440 --> 03:17:43,680
Not really 109 goals before 11

2840
03:17:46,200 --> 03:17:47,040
really

2841
03:17:50,560 --> 03:17:54,160
select all from

2842
03:17:55,640 --> 03:17:57,840
one wrong person

2843
03:18:00,240 --> 03:18:03,000
order by already

2844
03:18:06,360 --> 03:18:09,360
just does not work

2845
03:18:09,360 --> 03:18:16,560
so well.

2846
03:18:16,560 --> 03:18:20,160
Can you guys
tell me the reason why it is not working?

2847
03:18:20,160 --> 03:18:21,760
Any guesses

2848
03:18:26,880 --> 03:18:28,040
in this

2849
03:18:28,040 --> 03:18:29,760
and being

2850
03:18:38,400 --> 03:18:40,200
four leading zeros needed in?

2851
03:18:40,200 --> 03:18:41,480
I'd be.

2852
03:18:42,120 --> 03:18:43,080
Yes I am on.

2853
03:18:43,080 --> 03:18:45,760
You are close, but not quite.

2854
03:18:45,760 --> 03:18:50,800
There you didn't put order
because you said it is randomly generated.

2855
03:18:52,040 --> 03:18:52,840
The data

2856
03:18:52,840 --> 03:18:56,880
type for the i.t is water.

2857
03:18:56,880 --> 03:18:59,600
It is not an automatic.

2858
03:18:59,600 --> 03:19:02,600
So that's why in water

2859
03:19:02,880 --> 03:19:07,760
technically ten
is smaller than 105 and 106.

2860
03:19:07,880 --> 03:19:09,880
So don't get confused guys.

2861
03:19:10,320 --> 03:19:14,280
If you are starting
and this thing is not working,

2862
03:19:14,560 --> 03:19:19,840
it might be working, but it is working
with respect to watch our data type.

2863
03:19:20,160 --> 03:19:20,560
Okay.

2864
03:19:21,280 --> 03:19:25,560
So that's why it can happen sometime
and usually it will happen

2865
03:19:25,560 --> 03:19:28,600
when the idea is usually ideas, they are

2866
03:19:29,720 --> 03:19:30,720
large, are based.

2867
03:19:30,720 --> 03:19:33,120
The negative for the it is, it is larger.

2868
03:19:33,440 --> 03:19:35,200
It's not numeric usually.

2869
03:19:35,200 --> 03:19:38,160
So you guys get into this issue.

2870
03:19:38,680 --> 03:19:39,440
I am sorry.

2871
03:19:39,440 --> 03:19:47,200
Just make sure two lines 38 and 3938
and you don't need to worry.

2872
03:19:47,200 --> 03:19:51,160
It is just a flag that we need to set
before we modified

2873
03:19:51,160 --> 03:19:54,760
the data in a database
for security purposes.

2874
03:19:55,160 --> 03:19:59,640
I asked you all by default or does not
let you delete or update the data.

2875
03:20:00,000 --> 03:20:03,480
By default it will ask you to foster,
set the proper flags

2876
03:20:03,480 --> 03:20:06,200
and then it will allow you,
even if you have the Edwyn permission.

2877
03:20:06,480 --> 03:20:11,680
So I have just set the value of that flag
so that I can easily get to.

2878
03:20:11,760 --> 03:20:13,560
The second one is

2879
03:20:14,720 --> 03:20:16,440
data should be

2880
03:20:16,440 --> 03:20:20,120
sorted based on this idea,
but it was not working.

2881
03:20:20,400 --> 03:20:24,680
So I am just explaining the reason
that in actual

2882
03:20:24,680 --> 03:20:28,120
the ID is a not in numeric column

2883
03:20:28,640 --> 03:20:31,160
and if you guys

2884
03:20:31,720 --> 03:20:47,200
want to check this, so

2885
03:20:47,760 --> 03:20:52,280
in here you are,
you guys will see the ID is var char

2886
03:20:52,320 --> 03:20:56,680
and I am allowing 100 characters in here
and it is a primary key.

2887
03:20:57,360 --> 03:21:01,600
So you can go inside that table
and you can check the info.

2888
03:21:01,600 --> 03:21:02,040
Okay.

2889
03:21:02,040 --> 03:21:06,720
So don't, don't worry if sometimes
the order by clause is not working,

2890
03:21:07,240 --> 03:21:10,600
it might be because the die is darker.

2891
03:21:10,600 --> 03:21:16,320
But so now tell me the edge is in beta 11.

2892
03:21:16,320 --> 03:21:24,080
Will it work on edge?

2893
03:21:24,080 --> 03:21:35,960
Okay, let's try it on the edge.

2894
03:21:35,960 --> 03:21:37,320
Quick question of the topic.

2895
03:21:37,320 --> 03:21:40,000
Do we have any preview tomorrow?

2896
03:21:40,000 --> 03:21:40,960
Tomorrow?

2897
03:21:40,960 --> 03:21:44,880
Tomorrow is Monday?

2898
03:21:44,880 --> 03:21:47,600
I don't think so.

2899
03:21:47,600 --> 03:21:52,480
You have a review related to school,
but I am not sure about your project

2900
03:21:52,520 --> 03:21:56,480
or something like that.

2901
03:21:56,480 --> 03:22:00,840
Do you guys see all the data
sorted with respect to it this time?

2902
03:22:01,200 --> 03:22:03,240
No errors. Everything looks good.

2903
03:22:04,520 --> 03:22:13,440
So yeah.

2904
03:22:13,680 --> 03:22:17,600
So this, this, this was one thing
that might waste

2905
03:22:17,600 --> 03:22:23,000
your RS
and might force to scratch your head.

2906
03:22:23,800 --> 03:22:25,760
I will keep on telling these things.

2907
03:22:25,760 --> 03:22:27,840
This is what I have learned
from experience.

2908
03:22:27,840 --> 03:22:31,840
So I eventually did that
for the last batch.

2909
03:22:31,840 --> 03:22:39,560
Okay, so.

2910
03:22:39,560 --> 03:22:44,520
So you now know how to sort the data
based on a specified column.

2911
03:22:44,520 --> 03:22:47,840
So why it didn't work with ID?

2912
03:22:47,840 --> 03:22:50,720
Because the data type of I.D.

2913
03:22:50,760 --> 03:22:52,920
is var job

2914
03:22:52,920 --> 03:22:54,560
in strings.

2915
03:22:54,560 --> 03:22:57,120
Sorting happens a different player, then

2916
03:22:57,120 --> 03:23:01,560
in pneumatic data.

2917
03:23:01,560 --> 03:23:06,560
So as part of the sorting
based on character

2918
03:23:06,560 --> 03:23:12,440
based data, yes.

2919
03:23:13,160 --> 03:23:16,240
Sorry,
I googled select all from persons order

2920
03:23:16,240 --> 03:23:19,720
by convert ID decimal number.

2921
03:23:20,400 --> 03:23:22,440
Okay,

2922
03:23:22,560 --> 03:23:24,360
let's try to do that.

2923
03:23:24,360 --> 03:23:27,400
It might work assignment.

2924
03:23:27,400 --> 03:23:28,240
Have you tried it?

2925
03:23:28,240 --> 03:23:32,600
I never it.

2926
03:23:32,600 --> 03:23:33,760
Does it work

2927
03:23:36,200 --> 03:23:38,640
that create perfect.

2928
03:23:38,640 --> 03:23:39,200
Okay.

2929
03:23:39,200 --> 03:23:41,720
We have the solution for this as well

2930
03:23:42,400 --> 03:23:46,200
so converting
I think this this convert function

2931
03:23:46,200 --> 03:23:49,800
is converting this ID to decimal numbers

2932
03:23:50,280 --> 03:23:53,160
and then we are applying the order
by clause.

2933
03:23:53,440 --> 03:23:53,880
Yeah.

2934
03:23:54,080 --> 03:23:57,480
So if you still to sort.

2935
03:23:57,800 --> 03:23:58,560
Yeah.

2936
03:23:58,560 --> 03:24:02,720
As nomadic sorting happens,
you can convert that

2937
03:24:02,760 --> 03:24:09,200
from desktop type to decimal
and then can apply the order by clause.

2938
03:24:09,600 --> 03:24:10,800
It's a good addition.

2939
03:24:10,800 --> 03:24:16,920
Let me put a comment in here.

2940
03:24:16,920 --> 03:24:20,640
Converts the dark part type

2941
03:24:21,880 --> 03:24:25,400
to a different desktop

2942
03:24:26,600 --> 03:24:31,320
and then apply the

2943
03:24:32,960 --> 03:24:34,760
sorting.

2944
03:24:34,760 --> 03:24:38,160
Yeah, perfect.

2945
03:24:38,160 --> 03:24:41,640
So now we can also sort of be

2946
03:24:44,000 --> 03:24:47,760
character based things
by converting them to numeric.

2947
03:24:48,680 --> 03:24:53,120
So if let's say for example,
if your ideas there

2948
03:24:53,680 --> 03:24:56,400
contain any letters,

2949
03:24:57,000 --> 03:24:59,760
I think in those cases it will work fine.

2950
03:25:00,040 --> 03:25:02,440
But we might face some issues

2951
03:25:02,960 --> 03:25:06,000
if we have number plus characters.

2952
03:25:06,160 --> 03:25:09,120
I am sure I was going to be
just that eventually anyway.

2953
03:25:09,160 --> 03:25:10,760
No, I didn't know about this.

2954
03:25:10,760 --> 03:25:13,320
Converting Simon.

2955
03:25:13,320 --> 03:25:17,680
I don't know everything about everything.

2956
03:25:17,680 --> 03:25:18,040
I don't.

2957
03:25:18,040 --> 03:25:22,200
I didn't needed that actually.

2958
03:25:22,200 --> 03:25:26,000
So yes, let me

2959
03:25:28,960 --> 03:25:32,080
let me try this.

2960
03:25:32,080 --> 03:25:33,400
But at least it works.

2961
03:25:33,400 --> 03:25:37,440
If we don't have characters,
we're still very good

2962
03:25:37,440 --> 03:25:41,560
additions, right?

2963
03:25:41,760 --> 03:25:44,720
Is equal to

2964
03:25:44,720 --> 03:25:46,880
then here

2965
03:25:47,400 --> 03:25:50,520
we are, six

2966
03:26:00,120 --> 03:26:15,440
of your next
at least we don't get any errors

2967
03:26:16,000 --> 03:26:18,960
and I think still eight
is better than having nothing.

2968
03:26:19,680 --> 03:26:21,520
You are home. Remember that?

2969
03:26:21,520 --> 03:26:25,320
Can we go home ugly
because we are doing so good?

2970
03:26:25,920 --> 03:26:30,000
Uh, no,
because started skirting the next link.

2971
03:26:30,560 --> 03:26:33,880
Let me check how much we have to

2972
03:26:33,880 --> 03:26:37,480
cover. You know?

2973
03:26:37,560 --> 03:26:40,200
Thank you, Simon, for the submission

2974
03:26:40,200 --> 03:26:43,680
of these

2975
03:26:44,880 --> 03:26:46,960
order by column name,

2976
03:26:47,400 --> 03:26:52,720
ascending or descending
right to salt detector.

2977
03:26:52,720 --> 03:26:58,200
Used to sort of be reserved
by a specific column, please.

2978
03:26:58,200 --> 03:27:00,040
And on time.

2979
03:27:00,040 --> 03:27:02,960
If it does not feel like it,
we are already finished.

2980
03:27:02,960 --> 03:27:03,960
Class one.

2981
03:27:04,920 --> 03:27:05,800
It's not working.

2982
03:27:05,800 --> 03:27:08,280
When I did the update person so tired.

2983
03:27:08,640 --> 03:27:09,160
Yes or no?

2984
03:27:09,160 --> 03:27:13,680
Because I have not given you the access
to update things

2985
03:27:13,680 --> 03:27:16,960
in that database.

2986
03:27:16,960 --> 03:27:21,720
Oh, that class was supposed
to be taught on a week day,

2987
03:27:22,080 --> 03:27:25,840
but we had having a weekend class
electrical it at least two classes

2988
03:27:27,320 --> 03:27:30,240
and then maybe we can go if we can do that

2989
03:27:30,240 --> 03:27:33,000
used to sort the readers
by a specific column,

2990
03:27:33,480 --> 03:27:36,440
last clause section.

2991
03:27:36,440 --> 03:27:37,080
This lecture.

2992
03:27:37,080 --> 03:27:39,320
It means that it should be the last thing

2993
03:27:42,440 --> 03:27:45,880
if you ask to start ascending
and descending,

2994
03:27:45,880 --> 03:27:48,960
ascending by default,
or we can specify descending

2995
03:27:51,040 --> 03:27:52,760
or here is one what

2996
03:27:52,760 --> 03:27:56,600
your answer for the null values.

2997
03:27:56,600 --> 03:28:01,000
So a lot of the times you guys will be
having these null values in your data.

2998
03:28:01,000 --> 03:28:03,000
Can we learn what we need to learn?

2999
03:28:03,960 --> 03:28:05,760
Yes, that's what we are doing.

3000
03:28:05,760 --> 03:28:21,920
Alex, did I teach you something extra?

3001
03:28:21,920 --> 03:28:26,720
I don't know why
I asked you this question, Alex. Why?

3002
03:28:26,720 --> 03:28:39,240
Why you ask why you ask that?

3003
03:28:39,240 --> 03:28:44,040
I mean, finished when we pass all in full
what we need.

3004
03:28:45,200 --> 03:28:46,880
Yes, I not.

3005
03:28:46,880 --> 03:28:50,080
I'm not listening to these ladies
who want to finish up

3006
03:28:50,160 --> 03:28:53,240
this.

3007
03:28:53,240 --> 03:28:54,680
Don't worry.

3008
03:28:55,040 --> 03:28:56,760
It's not about ladies.

3009
03:28:56,760 --> 03:28:59,640
Even if men that will be asking this,

3010
03:29:00,120 --> 03:29:06,000
I will not be doing that.

3011
03:29:06,000 --> 03:29:06,840
I'm just kidding.

3012
03:29:06,840 --> 03:29:07,320
Nice.

3013
03:29:07,320 --> 03:29:09,240
Actually, this class was

3014
03:29:09,240 --> 03:29:14,240
supposed to be taught on a big day,
but this is a weekend class.

3015
03:29:14,480 --> 03:29:16,720
That's why we are learning.

3016
03:29:16,720 --> 03:29:21,000
That's why we are coding extra stuff.

3017
03:29:21,000 --> 03:29:25,080
I am sure these ladies will
one day will kill me

3018
03:29:26,400 --> 03:29:28,160
because I don't know why

3019
03:29:29,760 --> 03:29:32,080
he. Ladies, please.

3020
03:29:32,080 --> 03:29:34,240
Sorry. Special sorry for the ladies.

3021
03:29:35,600 --> 03:29:36,680
They have very big heart.

3022
03:29:36,680 --> 03:29:42,680
You know they don't mind.

3023
03:29:42,680 --> 03:29:44,120
All right, guys.

3024
03:29:44,120 --> 03:29:47,640
So can you guys affect the data

3025
03:29:47,720 --> 03:29:51,600
for which this city is null

3026
03:29:55,520 --> 03:29:55,840
nights?

3027
03:29:55,840 --> 03:30:01,280
Can you write acuity to fetch the data
for which we have city

3028
03:30:01,320 --> 03:30:20,160
as null.

3029
03:30:20,160 --> 03:30:24,720
NULL is equal to nine for null, null
is something else.

3030
03:30:24,720 --> 03:30:27,200
Nine for else you see

3031
03:30:28,440 --> 03:30:31,080
for example for 30 for this road ten.

3032
03:30:31,840 --> 03:30:37,720
I have this empty data
and I have this null data null and empty.

3033
03:30:37,720 --> 03:30:42,800
There are two different things in school.

3034
03:30:42,800 --> 03:30:46,080
So Hasim has pride discovery

3035
03:30:47,680 --> 03:30:48,120
for me.

3036
03:30:48,120 --> 03:30:49,680
Copy this, don't you guys?

3037
03:30:49,680 --> 03:30:52,000
Right. Discovery to get this.

3038
03:30:52,000 --> 03:31:03,120
It is where the values null.

3039
03:31:03,120 --> 03:31:04,680
Did it work?

3040
03:31:04,680 --> 03:31:07,320
It's not working right.

3041
03:31:07,320 --> 03:31:09,480
So why it is not working?

3042
03:31:10,840 --> 03:31:12,040
Try fight the

3043
03:31:12,040 --> 03:31:16,000
cities We are City is empty

3044
03:31:18,600 --> 03:31:21,800
Try to check if that works.

3045
03:31:21,800 --> 03:31:23,800
Is line 44 works for you know

3046
03:31:23,800 --> 03:31:26,840
it also does not work for

3047
03:31:26,920 --> 03:31:28,360
in this one.

3048
03:31:28,360 --> 03:31:29,440
Sorting. For sorting.

3049
03:31:29,440 --> 03:31:30,320
Yes, for sorting.

3050
03:31:30,320 --> 03:31:32,640
It works.

3051
03:31:32,640 --> 03:31:34,840
So there are multiple values.

3052
03:31:34,840 --> 03:31:35,640
Guys. Observe.

3053
03:31:35,640 --> 03:31:39,000
I have a zero. Yes.

3054
03:31:39,000 --> 03:31:44,160
Empty is not normal
so I have null zero and empty.

3055
03:31:44,520 --> 03:31:46,800
So these are three different things.

3056
03:31:46,800 --> 03:31:48,360
Zero does not mean empty.

3057
03:31:48,360 --> 03:31:50,400
Does not mean null. NULL is null.

3058
03:31:50,400 --> 03:31:52,560
Empty is empty. Zero zero.

3059
03:31:52,560 --> 03:31:55,200
So can you guys fetch the city

3060
03:31:55,200 --> 03:32:06,240
for which the city is empty?

3061
03:32:06,240 --> 03:32:08,760
Try something like this.

3062
03:32:08,760 --> 03:32:09,520
Let's.

3063
03:32:09,520 --> 03:32:16,440
Let's check if it works.

3064
03:32:16,440 --> 03:32:19,200
So this works for empty.

3065
03:32:19,200 --> 03:32:23,440
If the city is empty and if we put force
and if we don't

3066
03:32:23,440 --> 03:32:27,360
put anything inside it for empty,
we are able to set it.

3067
03:32:27,360 --> 03:32:27,640
Next.

3068
03:32:27,640 --> 03:32:31,440
Let's try to do zero.

3069
03:32:31,440 --> 03:32:33,640
Because cities, they are

3070
03:32:34,760 --> 03:32:37,040
watertight, character based.

3071
03:32:37,080 --> 03:32:37,800
Right?

3072
03:32:37,800 --> 03:32:41,680
So should I put a zero like this

3073
03:32:43,080 --> 03:32:48,720
or inside the double code?

3074
03:32:48,720 --> 03:32:52,840
If I put a zero like this, I again

3075
03:32:52,840 --> 03:32:56,840
don't get to the proper results,
which means so,

3076
03:32:58,160 --> 03:33:00,680
which means it's a very,

3077
03:33:00,680 --> 03:33:03,720
very good practice to use course

3078
03:33:03,760 --> 03:33:06,000
when that type is what job

3079
03:33:06,720 --> 03:33:10,280
and not use because when it is

3080
03:33:10,280 --> 03:33:14,760
numeric based, let's let's check
if it works with double code.

3081
03:33:15,360 --> 03:33:17,520
This time it works.

3082
03:33:17,520 --> 03:33:18,560
So this works.

3083
03:33:18,560 --> 03:33:20,160
This works.

3084
03:33:20,680 --> 03:33:22,920
But why does not the null work?

3085
03:33:23,480 --> 03:33:30,040
Because NULL is a special type in school
and it has a special operator.

3086
03:33:30,040 --> 03:33:33,120
If you want to avoid it,
you have to say is

3087
03:33:34,560 --> 03:33:38,040
null the equal to sign
will not work for us.

3088
03:33:39,480 --> 03:33:44,520
It's a special state in database
and it is treated specially in school.

3089
03:33:45,600 --> 03:33:48,960
So that's why we have a separate operator
for this time.

3090
03:33:48,960 --> 03:33:50,960
It will work not it is not a string.

3091
03:33:50,960 --> 03:33:53,080
It's a separate special data type.

3092
03:33:53,920 --> 03:33:56,160
That does not mean empty.

3093
03:33:56,160 --> 03:33:58,800
That does not mean zero.

3094
03:33:59,240 --> 03:34:01,960
It's null means null. Okay.

3095
03:34:02,000 --> 03:34:03,520
It works differently.

3096
03:34:03,520 --> 03:34:07,320
So be careful
when you are trying to fight.

3097
03:34:07,320 --> 03:34:11,040
Two null values we have to use is null

3098
03:34:11,520 --> 03:34:14,520
and if you want the data that is not null,

3099
03:34:15,320 --> 03:34:18,240
then should say is not null.

3100
03:34:18,960 --> 03:34:22,400
Instead of saying that
not equal to null or equal to null,

3101
03:34:22,400 --> 03:34:26,280
it will not work.

3102
03:34:26,280 --> 03:34:27,680
No zero is different.

3103
03:34:27,680 --> 03:34:28,680
Empty is different.

3104
03:34:28,680 --> 03:34:31,560
NULL is different.

3105
03:34:31,560 --> 03:34:33,600
Well, no, no.

3106
03:34:33,600 --> 03:34:36,160
Even putting it inside a double course,
I don't think so.

3107
03:34:36,160 --> 03:34:42,000
It will work the proper best practice that
will work on all the databases is using.

3108
03:34:42,000 --> 03:34:44,760
This is operator is and is not.

3109
03:34:46,120 --> 03:34:48,640
When you
want to avoid the null in the results, act

3110
03:34:48,680 --> 03:34:52,440
use is not null
when you want to have null use.

3111
03:34:52,440 --> 03:34:56,280
Isn't that now execute this for you
these guys

3112
03:34:56,280 --> 03:35:00,640
and tell me
if you get your expected results.

3113
03:35:01,000 --> 03:35:03,120
Let me repeat it again.

3114
03:35:03,120 --> 03:35:08,040
In school, 90% of the times
you guys will not get any error,

3115
03:35:08,400 --> 03:35:11,120
but you will get wrong with data.

3116
03:35:11,120 --> 03:35:13,360
So it's very, very different than Java.

3117
03:35:13,360 --> 03:35:16,200
You should always double check your delta.

3118
03:35:16,520 --> 03:35:20,440
For example, if you have written a query,
always double your delta

3119
03:35:20,440 --> 03:35:26,200
if you are getting the expected results
of not because school 90% of the time

3120
03:35:26,200 --> 03:35:29,520
it will not throw you an error,
it will just return you the wrong data.

3121
03:35:29,520 --> 03:35:33,520
And if you don't cross-check it,
you might be reporting bad results.

3122
03:35:34,200 --> 03:35:37,120
Getting at that error is better to see
what is wrong.

3123
03:35:37,120 --> 03:35:40,960
Yes, but because I am not different
databases are defined

3124
03:35:40,960 --> 03:35:42,200
by different companies.

3125
03:35:42,200 --> 03:35:46,200
Some of them they will give you an error,
but not all of them.

3126
03:35:46,200 --> 03:35:48,680
You cannot guarantee
that you will always get an.

3127
03:35:48,680 --> 03:35:52,760
Edit It depends on the company
which is implementing that well,

3128
03:35:52,800 --> 03:35:54,480
which is building their database.

3129
03:35:55,480 --> 03:35:56,760
So it's on

3130
03:35:56,760 --> 03:36:00,200
us to use the best practice,
unfortunately.

3131
03:36:01,320 --> 03:36:03,120
Yes, you are right.

3132
03:36:03,120 --> 03:36:06,000
We should definitely get an error

3133
03:36:06,000 --> 03:36:10,560
and XYZ.

3134
03:36:10,920 --> 03:36:15,000
Does it work
Now you guys get all the expected results

3135
03:36:15,000 --> 03:36:19,560
when you use this way.

3136
03:36:19,560 --> 03:36:25,280
49 is not getting the right results.

3137
03:36:25,280 --> 03:36:31,160
You are getting some null values passing.

3138
03:36:31,160 --> 03:36:33,360
We are not relevant. 50 column.

3139
03:36:33,600 --> 03:36:35,320
I don't see any.

3140
03:36:35,320 --> 03:36:39,240
Do you get any null values in this column
even if you put is not null.

3141
03:36:40,400 --> 03:36:43,920
Empty is equal to 46.

3142
03:36:43,920 --> 03:36:44,760
You mean

3143
03:36:57,560 --> 03:36:58,560
for this last one?

3144
03:36:58,560 --> 03:36:59,640
It will always be null.

3145
03:36:59,640 --> 03:37:01,680
It is null for everything.

3146
03:37:01,680 --> 03:37:06,600
This is how it is
how your workbench displays the data.

3147
03:37:07,120 --> 03:37:09,480
It's not an edit operation
or anything like that.

3148
03:37:09,960 --> 03:37:12,240
It's because of my skill workbench

3149
03:37:13,720 --> 03:37:16,360
4647 working. Yes.

3150
03:37:17,240 --> 03:37:18,320
Alex, did you try

3151
03:37:19,720 --> 03:37:21,000
try them and let me know

3152
03:37:21,000 --> 03:37:22,360
they don't work

3153
03:37:30,440 --> 03:37:31,280
properly.

3154
03:37:34,920 --> 03:37:37,000
What is magenta,

3155
03:37:37,040 --> 03:37:40,000
if I remember, is also tools, a skill or

3156
03:37:40,000 --> 03:37:44,760
something like that.

3157
03:37:44,760 --> 03:37:49,000
I know about Magneto,
that character in X-Men movie.

3158
03:37:49,000 --> 03:37:52,360
I don't know about the string
that you have typed in years or one

3159
03:37:54,160 --> 03:37:54,920
word result.

3160
03:37:54,920 --> 03:37:56,120
We will see.

3161
03:37:56,120 --> 03:37:58,240
You should see and pay for this one.

3162
03:37:59,760 --> 03:38:03,560
You should see zero for this one.

3163
03:38:03,560 --> 03:38:05,360
The City of zero 49.

3164
03:38:05,360 --> 03:38:08,880
Why get empty City

3165
03:38:09,040 --> 03:38:11,120
Because empty and annul.

3166
03:38:11,160 --> 03:38:15,360
They are two different things.

3167
03:38:15,360 --> 03:38:17,520
Empty is not the same as null housing.

3168
03:38:17,760 --> 03:38:18,960
Therefore

3169
03:38:21,200 --> 03:38:24,120
that's
what I wanted to explicitly tell you.

3170
03:38:24,120 --> 03:38:27,040
That's why I especially inserted
all types of the time.

3171
03:38:27,040 --> 03:38:28,200
This column

3172
03:38:31,560 --> 03:38:35,280
can you in 46 gaps

3173
03:38:40,320 --> 03:38:41,400
on zero.

3174
03:38:41,400 --> 03:38:44,160
I see null in here.

3175
03:38:44,240 --> 03:38:50,640
You see in the null data, I don't see it.

3176
03:38:51,240 --> 03:38:54,600
Are you using the course
using zero in charge?

3177
03:38:54,600 --> 03:38:57,360
Because now listen all empty is empty.

3178
03:38:57,360 --> 03:39:00,480
Zero zero once again must at least in this

3179
03:39:01,760 --> 03:39:04,080
case, yes, it can be very confusing.

3180
03:39:04,080 --> 03:39:05,400
Sometimes

3181
03:39:10,560 --> 03:39:12,400
with some of these things.

3182
03:39:12,400 --> 03:39:16,360
They took me, believe me,
they took me days to understand why

3183
03:39:16,360 --> 03:39:20,080
that thing is working this
with a lot of research and all that.

3184
03:39:20,400 --> 03:39:22,680
Because when you don't know,
you just keep on

3185
03:39:24,760 --> 03:39:26,880
scratching your head

3186
03:39:26,880 --> 03:39:28,920
for the answers.

3187
03:39:29,880 --> 03:39:31,800
Oh, Elena, I told you

3188
03:39:31,800 --> 03:39:34,600
many times this last row, it is null.

3189
03:39:34,600 --> 03:39:37,560
It is just how your coolest

3190
03:39:38,360 --> 03:39:41,480
software ever developed by humanity.

3191
03:39:41,840 --> 03:39:44,320
That is called my skill workbench.

3192
03:39:44,320 --> 03:39:46,680
The just words and null rule

3193
03:39:46,680 --> 03:39:51,360
at the end of need to resolve
that is because is equal work.

3194
03:39:51,360 --> 03:39:54,600
When you're good,
is it telling you the correct phrases

3195
03:39:58,800 --> 03:39:59,280
what's

3196
03:40:01,440 --> 03:40:02,040
known as

3197
03:40:02,040 --> 03:40:07,440
the argumentative type?

3198
03:40:07,440 --> 03:40:10,800
Okay,
so this is about the null null operator.

3199
03:40:11,600 --> 03:40:14,640
Not possible to test the null values

3200
03:40:14,640 --> 03:40:18,840
with operator
equal to or not equal to UTC.

3201
03:40:19,840 --> 03:40:20,640
We use

3202
03:40:20,640 --> 03:40:23,800
is the null operator selects only be rows.

3203
03:40:23,800 --> 03:40:26,280
We are specific of value is in now.

3204
03:40:27,480 --> 03:40:30,920
This is your task.

3205
03:40:30,920 --> 03:40:34,200
Okay you guys already

3206
03:40:34,200 --> 03:40:38,040
we have already done this
and or operator this.

3207
03:40:38,080 --> 03:40:41,160
Not between and in operator.

3208
03:40:41,160 --> 03:40:43,800
Let me tell you what Oracle

3209
03:40:43,800 --> 03:40:46,600
so I'm not

3210
03:40:46,880 --> 03:40:50,840
there is a there is one more where

3211
03:40:53,280 --> 03:40:56,640
to specify the not conditions

3212
03:40:56,760 --> 03:41:00,480
but again it is not the best practice so

3213
03:41:02,080 --> 03:41:16,200
don't use it too much.

3214
03:41:16,200 --> 03:41:18,240
But if I execute this query,

3215
03:41:19,240 --> 03:41:21,840
I will be getting all the results

3216
03:41:23,880 --> 03:41:26,400
for which the age is 23.

3217
03:41:26,400 --> 03:41:30,760
I can also use this
not in front of any column

3218
03:41:30,920 --> 03:41:33,840
to reverse condition.

3219
03:41:33,840 --> 03:41:39,120
Yeah, but it might not work
on all the databases.

3220
03:41:39,120 --> 03:41:39,600
Okay.

3221
03:41:39,600 --> 03:41:42,960
You can use it on the supported ones
so it will not.

3222
03:41:42,960 --> 03:41:45,120
It will reverse that.

3223
03:41:45,120 --> 03:41:47,240
I don't think so. You guys should worry.

3224
03:41:47,240 --> 03:41:50,840
Just have that in mind
that this is also possible.

3225
03:41:50,840 --> 03:41:52,400
This is also a syntax.

3226
03:41:52,400 --> 03:41:56,160
Otherwise always try to use this operator
because you guys

3227
03:41:56,160 --> 03:41:57,520
are more familiar with this

3228
03:41:58,480 --> 03:41:58,920
and it

3229
03:41:58,920 --> 03:42:01,960
will be easy for you to build a logic
using this.

3230
03:42:01,960 --> 03:42:04,240
Operator Right. Same Rhythms.

3231
03:42:04,240 --> 03:42:06,800
But it's also possible

3232
03:42:07,480 --> 03:42:10,360
with this, not operator

3233
03:42:11,640 --> 03:42:14,840
Okay, then the next is between again

3234
03:42:16,280 --> 03:42:20,840
between is same as the end operator.

3235
03:42:20,840 --> 03:42:24,120
So if I write

3236
03:42:26,280 --> 03:42:28,080
and again between my

3237
03:42:28,080 --> 03:42:30,680
do not work on all of the database is

3238
03:42:39,120 --> 03:42:42,040
actually looking that article without

3239
03:42:42,040 --> 03:42:48,120
between.

3240
03:42:48,120 --> 03:42:55,720
So let's say we have this query,

3241
03:42:55,720 --> 03:43:00,000
we are fetching only those results
where edge is

3242
03:43:03,360 --> 03:43:04,080
oops,

3243
03:43:04,800 --> 03:43:07,880
the edge is greater than 23

3244
03:43:09,840 --> 03:43:13,000
or greater than to quantity or less

3245
03:43:14,240 --> 03:43:20,040
45, and it is less than equal to

3246
03:43:20,040 --> 03:43:22,040
maybe 20

3247
03:43:24,680 --> 03:43:28,360
plus.

3248
03:43:28,360 --> 03:43:34,080
Okay, so we get 28, 25, 25 right now

3249
03:43:34,120 --> 03:43:36,400
let's try

3250
03:43:43,400 --> 03:43:56,800
new same.

3251
03:43:56,800 --> 03:44:02,080
So for the north country 325

3252
03:44:02,080 --> 03:44:07,800
for 28.

3253
03:44:07,800 --> 03:44:10,200
So again we got the same results.

3254
03:44:10,200 --> 03:44:14,600
So this between
is actually alternate of this one.

3255
03:44:15,120 --> 03:44:19,360
So whichever you guys find easier,
you can use both of them

3256
03:44:20,040 --> 03:44:24,800
and there is no difference
in terms of performance or anything. Yes.

3257
03:44:24,880 --> 03:44:26,320
Between is inclusive

3258
03:44:27,640 --> 03:44:31,280
25 and
28 will be included in the disaster.

3259
03:44:31,280 --> 03:44:34,440
That's why I added this greater than equal
to or less than equal.

3260
03:44:35,880 --> 03:44:38,800
So this is the alternate thing.

3261
03:44:38,800 --> 03:44:41,040
So you guys also don't

3262
03:44:41,040 --> 03:44:45,280
need to memorize this and just have that

3263
03:44:45,920 --> 03:44:50,520
in mind that this thing exists
and of this thing can be written

3264
03:44:50,520 --> 03:44:53,520
in terms of this thing
because some most of the time

3265
03:44:53,840 --> 03:44:57,000
you guys might be reading the queries
written by others.

3266
03:44:57,000 --> 03:44:59,640
So you must know what kind of things

3267
03:45:00,280 --> 03:45:03,400
can be written, in which other ways

3268
03:45:04,160 --> 03:45:06,760
all looks good guys, Or is it exactly that

3269
03:45:07,000 --> 03:45:13,880
it has confused you?

3270
03:45:13,880 --> 03:45:14,400
Okay.

3271
03:45:14,600 --> 03:45:17,640
And then just a different syntax.

3272
03:45:17,880 --> 03:45:18,920
This interpreter.

3273
03:45:18,920 --> 03:45:24,160
It is also a an alternate to this thing.

3274
03:45:24,160 --> 03:45:28,680
So let's say, for example,
if you are writing this security

3275
03:45:31,320 --> 03:45:34,160
persons we are age

3276
03:45:34,800 --> 03:45:37,520
is equal to 25

3277
03:45:37,520 --> 03:45:41,640
or age is equal to 28

3278
03:45:41,680 --> 03:45:45,480
or age is equal to 23.

3279
03:45:45,480 --> 03:45:48,000
So if you have multiple or conditions

3280
03:45:48,560 --> 03:45:51,120
on this same column, same column,

3281
03:45:51,720 --> 03:45:54,480
then instead of writing this or again

3282
03:45:54,480 --> 03:45:58,440
and again,

3283
03:45:58,440 --> 03:46:03,960
you guys can use the interpreter age 18

3284
03:46:05,240 --> 03:46:10,080
and then 2335 I get it like this.

3285
03:46:11,200 --> 03:46:13,440
So it's just a shorter way

3286
03:46:13,440 --> 03:46:16,680
to avoid writing longer duties.

3287
03:46:16,680 --> 03:46:22,800
So multiple are conditions age
23 or eight, age 28 or age 25.

3288
03:46:22,800 --> 03:46:26,560
Instead of specifying
these three conditions in again

3289
03:46:26,560 --> 03:46:30,760
and again with the auto operator,
if the conditions belong

3290
03:46:30,760 --> 03:46:34,360
to the same column, remember same column.

3291
03:46:34,680 --> 03:46:38,400
If this column is different than this,
then we cannot apply the information.

3292
03:46:38,640 --> 03:46:41,880
Then instead of writing it again
and again, try to age in

3293
03:46:42,240 --> 03:46:44,440
and then specify the conditions. Yeah,

3294
03:46:45,640 --> 03:46:48,120
on of mean I

3295
03:47:00,120 --> 03:47:02,120
and we

3296
03:47:02,120 --> 03:47:06,840
addressed this.

3297
03:47:06,840 --> 03:47:10,160
So these three, they are all possible

3298
03:47:10,160 --> 03:47:12,240
with the limitations,

3299
03:47:13,800 --> 03:47:16,240
but they also exist.

3300
03:47:16,240 --> 03:47:24,600
Some of the databases might support them.

3301
03:47:24,600 --> 03:47:29,960
So and the operator is same as in Java
where you specify

3302
03:47:30,040 --> 03:47:34,560
multiple conditions
or is same as we specify or in condition.

3303
03:47:35,080 --> 03:47:39,040
Notice is again,
same to reverse this condition

3304
03:47:40,160 --> 03:47:42,480
in operator fix,

3305
03:47:42,480 --> 03:47:45,720
multiple options from the same column

3306
03:47:46,160 --> 03:47:49,920
allows you to specify multiple values.

3307
03:47:49,920 --> 03:47:50,880
A weird clause.

3308
03:47:50,880 --> 03:47:54,600
It is a shorthand or B for operator.

3309
03:47:54,720 --> 03:47:59,800
Okay so use in if you are writing
multiple times between is a

3310
03:48:01,080 --> 03:48:05,480
alternate of greater
than and less than sign.

3311
03:48:05,480 --> 03:48:09,400
So test whether the value falls
within a range of given boundaries

3312
03:48:09,400 --> 03:48:12,960
between all.

3313
03:48:13,000 --> 03:48:15,240
You guys are also
done with the second class.

3314
03:48:16,200 --> 03:48:17,240
And that means

3315
03:48:17,240 --> 03:48:20,400
in next 30 minutes we can cover
maybe it is

3316
03:48:20,400 --> 03:48:22,760
third class or

3317
03:48:26,600 --> 03:48:28,080
let me do it.

3318
03:48:28,080 --> 03:48:31,920
Maybe in next 30 minutes
we can cover the next class. As a

3319
03:48:33,400 --> 03:48:37,840
reaction from Batch 11. It's

3320
03:48:39,920 --> 03:48:40,240
okay.

3321
03:48:40,240 --> 03:48:46,200
We are not covering the third class.

3322
03:48:46,200 --> 03:48:48,600
You are also using that.

3323
03:48:49,560 --> 03:48:51,600
Let's finish all of the classes.

3324
03:48:51,600 --> 03:48:53,560
It's easy to write this.

3325
03:48:53,560 --> 03:48:55,800
Is anyone confused or thinks that

3326
03:48:57,080 --> 03:49:00,480
I am messing with you?

3327
03:49:00,480 --> 03:49:02,480
It's clear. Simple example.

3328
03:49:02,480 --> 03:49:04,240
Simple.

3329
03:49:04,240 --> 03:49:06,480
So we can use between with work job.

3330
03:49:06,480 --> 03:49:10,120
If we sort of did that to the mirror,

3331
03:49:10,120 --> 03:49:13,600
you have not used it with the large data.

3332
03:49:13,600 --> 03:49:15,720
Can you please write?

3333
03:49:15,960 --> 03:49:18,000
I have only used it with numeric data.

3334
03:49:18,400 --> 03:49:19,200
I don't think so.

3335
03:49:19,200 --> 03:49:21,400
We will be getting good reasons for

3336
03:49:23,760 --> 03:49:23,960
then.

3337
03:49:23,960 --> 03:49:36,000
You open my school.

3338
03:49:36,000 --> 03:49:36,280
Okay.

3339
03:49:36,280 --> 03:49:40,120
Let me just teach you this last thing
and then you guys can have some

3340
03:49:40,120 --> 03:49:49,280
rest. Um,

3341
03:49:50,280 --> 03:49:52,440
and so this last thing is,

3342
03:49:53,400 --> 03:49:59,080
you guys already know it, or do you guys
all know everything already?

3343
03:49:59,240 --> 03:49:59,480
What?

3344
03:49:59,480 --> 03:50:00,600
Vanessa

3345
03:50:03,000 --> 03:50:05,120
You guys remember the string functions

3346
03:50:06,160 --> 03:50:08,160
starts with and the way

3347
03:50:08,160 --> 03:50:11,280
the contains function

3348
03:50:11,280 --> 03:50:13,800
is that there is nothing, right?

3349
03:50:13,880 --> 03:50:14,880
You are smart.

3350
03:50:14,880 --> 03:50:16,160
That's why

3351
03:50:16,640 --> 03:50:18,720
everything gives you the right.

3352
03:50:18,720 --> 03:50:21,680
Does not have to do anything with me

3353
03:50:24,240 --> 03:50:34,680
Genesis.

3354
03:50:34,680 --> 03:50:38,720
So you guys remember the stocks
with the function

3355
03:50:41,320 --> 03:50:44,200
in from Java Wood to No,

3356
03:50:44,240 --> 03:50:50,760
we are not baby boys and girls anymore.

3357
03:50:50,760 --> 03:51:02,520
Starts with No, no,
not not from selenium, from Java. No.

3358
03:51:02,520 --> 03:51:06,520
So let's say I want all the names

3359
03:51:06,520 --> 03:51:09,360
that start with a letter E

3360
03:51:10,640 --> 03:51:13,200
so what I can do I can say E

3361
03:51:14,160 --> 03:51:16,200
and then percent de sign.

3362
03:51:16,960 --> 03:51:20,440
It's the same as

3363
03:51:21,240 --> 03:51:23,000
starts with

3364
03:51:24,000 --> 03:51:26,920
function from Java

3365
03:51:33,200 --> 03:51:36,840
you select all from person with plus name

3366
03:51:36,840 --> 03:51:41,640
between olina and full or by a first name.

3367
03:51:41,920 --> 03:51:46,600
That's great.

3368
03:51:46,600 --> 03:51:50,520
But how do you know if a smaller and a

3369
03:51:50,520 --> 03:51:54,000
Z are in Olina

3370
03:51:54,000 --> 03:52:00,720
and GL?

3371
03:52:00,720 --> 03:52:07,000
You are literally taking it?

3372
03:52:07,000 --> 03:52:08,520
Sebastian

3373
03:52:12,320 --> 03:52:14,000
The standing order.

3374
03:52:14,000 --> 03:52:16,560
Okay, I will do my research on it

3375
03:52:16,560 --> 03:52:20,040
and maybe we can discuss it tomorrow
in the next class.

3376
03:52:20,040 --> 03:52:25,800
Actually remind me about it
so that we can tell others as much.

3377
03:52:27,360 --> 03:52:32,000
So the guide to write this function

3378
03:52:32,000 --> 03:52:34,040
we use the operator like.

3379
03:52:35,200 --> 03:52:38,520
And then inside the double course, we

3380
03:52:39,600 --> 03:52:42,280
the letter and this person,

3381
03:52:42,400 --> 03:52:44,560
a symbol actually in here means that

3382
03:52:45,560 --> 03:52:49,880
the first letter should be a
and after that

3383
03:52:49,880 --> 03:52:54,400
there can be any number of letters
and there can be any letter.

3384
03:52:54,800 --> 03:52:59,880
The first letter should be air after this,
we can have anything.

3385
03:53:00,360 --> 03:53:03,880
So let's say if we want to have

3386
03:53:04,080 --> 03:53:10,680
and ends with the met function,
can you guys tell me how should I

3387
03:53:11,960 --> 03:53:13,720
modify this?

3388
03:53:13,720 --> 03:53:18,600
Let's say I want only those names
that end at letter

3389
03:53:18,600 --> 03:53:23,040
M, I will say

3390
03:53:25,320 --> 03:53:27,360
first we can have anything.

3391
03:53:27,560 --> 03:53:30,000
But the last letter should be M

3392
03:53:30,520 --> 03:53:35,120
okay, just put this
M after the person based sign.

3393
03:53:35,120 --> 03:53:36,560
So now first name.

3394
03:53:36,560 --> 03:53:42,240
If there are any first names
that end with M, Adam and Zam.

3395
03:53:42,600 --> 03:53:44,640
So we see both of these.

3396
03:53:44,840 --> 03:53:46,240
So what how it is working?

3397
03:53:46,240 --> 03:53:48,160
It is. We are saying

3398
03:53:48,880 --> 03:53:51,520
first there can be any number of letters,

3399
03:53:51,840 --> 03:53:55,280
any letters,
but the last letter should be m in here.

3400
03:53:55,280 --> 03:53:59,480
We are saying first letter should be air
last after air

3401
03:53:59,520 --> 03:54:02,120
we can have any number of letters,
any letter.

3402
03:54:02,160 --> 03:54:05,760
Why do we have this error?

3403
03:54:05,760 --> 03:54:09,360
It's because you are missing
the semicolon on the above line.

3404
03:54:09,360 --> 03:54:10,640
Most probably.

3405
03:54:10,640 --> 03:54:12,640
That's why you will see
an editor on Select.

3406
03:54:13,280 --> 03:54:18,240
If you put the semicolon on the above
line, you should not have that out of you.

3407
03:54:18,240 --> 03:54:20,760
See, I know that you want to be married.

3408
03:54:20,800 --> 03:54:24,160
It's already three and five
and he is not in a hurry to go back

3409
03:54:24,160 --> 03:54:27,200
home.

3410
03:54:27,200 --> 03:54:30,200
Well, yes, actually I have observed
this then is you are right.

3411
03:54:30,560 --> 03:54:34,080
In my last company
I have to see married ones.

3412
03:54:34,080 --> 03:54:36,680
They to come to office even on Sundays.

3413
03:54:36,800 --> 03:54:42,480
I didn't understand at that time why
these guys are coming or even on Sundays.

3414
03:54:43,160 --> 03:54:45,840
And they were late after the job

3415
03:54:46,640 --> 03:54:50,440
each day.

3416
03:54:50,440 --> 03:54:56,400
Ladies, please be solved with men.

3417
03:54:56,400 --> 03:54:59,840
And No, no. The reason was why I now know.

3418
03:55:01,240 --> 03:55:01,960
Because if they

3419
03:55:01,960 --> 03:55:05,960
stay on,
they have to do some work in the house.

3420
03:55:05,960 --> 03:55:16,520
I do Sometimes kids.

3421
03:55:16,520 --> 03:55:18,600
And can you guys tell me about it?

3422
03:55:18,600 --> 03:55:20,800
Contains a method

3423
03:55:23,840 --> 03:55:25,040
if there is

3424
03:55:25,040 --> 03:55:29,040
any name that contains M
So I am putting a person

3425
03:55:29,040 --> 03:55:32,960
de sign and before them and in person
put in person they say after.

3426
03:55:33,120 --> 03:55:35,880
Why so hard working woman They are married

3427
03:55:41,320 --> 03:55:44,640
and plus the overtime company
used to give them over time.

3428
03:55:44,640 --> 03:55:46,680
So why not make money?

3429
03:55:46,680 --> 03:55:49,240
And they happy and feel relaxed

3430
03:55:49,840 --> 03:55:53,320
instead of having that much pressure
from life

3431
03:55:53,920 --> 03:55:56,760
and wasting some overtime?

3432
03:55:56,760 --> 03:55:57,040
Right.

3433
03:55:57,040 --> 03:56:01,880
So now, person decided any number
of letters and characters before m

3434
03:56:02,080 --> 03:56:09,760
any number of letters and character
after them.

3435
03:56:09,760 --> 03:56:15,960
So all the first names which have the
letter M, we will see them in the output

3436
03:56:17,640 --> 03:56:20,040
they are they easy?

3437
03:56:20,160 --> 03:56:22,760
Are you guys confused?

3438
03:56:22,800 --> 03:56:33,360
Yes. Contains right.

3439
03:56:33,360 --> 03:56:37,040
I think that's that's it
for this underscore

3440
03:56:37,280 --> 03:56:50,560
let me teach you about this decimal.

3441
03:56:50,560 --> 03:56:54,840
So right now there is no restriction.

3442
03:56:55,000 --> 03:56:58,000
There can be any number letters

3443
03:56:58,000 --> 03:57:03,920
after the letter F in
uh, in the first name,

3444
03:57:05,200 --> 03:57:06,760
the active time.

3445
03:57:06,760 --> 03:57:09,360
Just five more minutes, Dennis.

3446
03:57:09,360 --> 03:57:12,280
But if you want to restrict
the number of letters.

3447
03:57:12,520 --> 03:57:17,120
So for example, this empty has only two.

3448
03:57:17,120 --> 03:57:20,120
Now, if I only want this

3449
03:57:23,160 --> 03:57:25,760
be names that contain two letters,

3450
03:57:27,320 --> 03:57:29,200
I I will say M

3451
03:57:29,200 --> 03:57:32,040
and after that I will say this underscore.

3452
03:57:33,120 --> 03:57:36,360
So now I ask you all will keep track

3453
03:57:36,360 --> 03:57:40,280
of the number of letters
in the first name as well.

3454
03:57:40,680 --> 03:57:45,320
If a first name has three letters,
I will not see that in my letter set.

3455
03:57:45,760 --> 03:57:49,560
I will only see those first names
which have two letters.

3456
03:57:49,760 --> 03:57:53,280
First should be M,
The second one can be anything.

3457
03:57:54,080 --> 03:57:56,640
Previously the first the restrict

3458
03:57:56,720 --> 03:57:58,920
it more restrictive first.

3459
03:57:59,680 --> 03:58:02,160
I was not restricting school

3460
03:58:02,440 --> 03:58:05,720
on the number of letters
that first name can have.

3461
03:58:06,120 --> 03:58:09,160
I said just make sure the first letter

3462
03:58:09,160 --> 03:58:12,120
is A After that, any number of letters,

3463
03:58:12,360 --> 03:58:17,440
any letters in here
I am saying the first name should be M.

3464
03:58:17,440 --> 03:58:21,840
The second name letter cannot be anything
and there should not

3465
03:58:21,840 --> 03:58:23,400
be more than two characters.

3466
03:58:24,520 --> 03:58:25,440
Guys get

3467
03:58:25,440 --> 03:58:29,960
the idea.

3468
03:58:29,960 --> 03:58:33,000
So let's say I only want to start

3469
03:58:33,040 --> 03:58:36,440
the names that have three letters.

3470
03:58:36,440 --> 03:58:39,120
So let's say I will say go.

3471
03:58:39,480 --> 03:58:41,760
Gee, you and then underscore.

3472
03:58:41,880 --> 03:58:47,080
Yes, like something
like regular expressions.

3473
03:58:47,080 --> 03:58:51,040
So I will
it will allow only search though,

3474
03:58:52,560 --> 03:58:55,520
which first names will be searched
this time.

3475
03:58:55,680 --> 03:58:59,280
How which first names
will be such this time?

3476
03:58:59,280 --> 03:59:00,760
How many characters they can have.

3477
03:59:00,760 --> 03:59:01,960
It makes

3478
03:59:02,840 --> 03:59:07,440
three First two letters should g and you.

3479
03:59:07,680 --> 03:59:14,040
And the last letter can be anything.

3480
03:59:14,040 --> 03:59:17,000
So we only see some more restriction.

3481
03:59:17,360 --> 03:59:22,440
But 90% of the time you guys will be able
to do that with this operator.

3482
03:59:22,440 --> 03:59:24,680
But you should still know.

3483
03:59:24,680 --> 03:59:26,760
And also, let's say

3484
03:59:29,040 --> 03:59:31,520
the first letter should be G made.

3485
03:59:31,600 --> 03:59:34,320
A letter can be anything,
and the last letter should be L,

3486
03:59:35,440 --> 03:59:39,160
and then I will again see

3487
03:59:39,720 --> 03:59:41,720
this good, right?

3488
03:59:41,720 --> 03:59:46,480
This one is more useful when you guys
will be dealing with the dates.

3489
03:59:46,880 --> 03:59:50,320
So for example, me

3490
03:59:50,320 --> 03:59:54,000
tell you about

3491
03:59:55,560 --> 03:59:55,840
that.

3492
03:59:55,840 --> 03:59:58,240
10% of the time always finds us.

3493
03:59:59,040 --> 04:00:01,920
If a yes.

3494
04:00:02,280 --> 04:00:06,200
So let's say you have
you are searching for the days.

3495
04:00:07,240 --> 04:00:10,320
Let's say
you are searching for the employers

3496
04:00:10,320 --> 04:00:13,320
whose of birth is on

3497
04:00:14,400 --> 04:00:16,400
in February and you guys are the query.

3498
04:00:17,400 --> 04:00:21,840
I only want
those employers who are in February

3499
04:00:22,080 --> 04:00:51,400
and it goes right to the weekly
and then you guys can leave.

3500
04:00:51,400 --> 04:00:56,640
I think we will be able to conclude
a skill by next Saturday.

3501
04:00:56,760 --> 04:00:59,800
If you guys give me this type of response

3502
04:00:59,800 --> 04:01:02,800
in the next classes as well,

3503
04:01:02,880 --> 04:01:05,120
I think you guys will be able to complete

3504
04:01:05,120 --> 04:01:08,920
a school in four classes, maybe five.

3505
04:01:08,920 --> 04:01:11,760
I didn't expect this
from you guys, to be honest,

3506
04:01:12,880 --> 04:01:16,840
in the given format like percentage
zero to

3507
04:01:23,920 --> 04:01:24,640
all. By the way,

3508
04:01:24,640 --> 04:01:28,480
this is also a trick
so that you guys don't run another.

3509
04:01:28,480 --> 04:01:31,240
So do you guys think
or we are very geniuses

3510
04:01:34,800 --> 04:01:36,760
like me?

3511
04:01:37,680 --> 04:01:39,920
Forget what I said.

3512
04:01:40,640 --> 04:01:44,000
Like B or B, after

3513
04:01:44,400 --> 04:01:46,440
all, is the date of birth

3514
04:01:50,160 --> 04:01:53,080
like M,

3515
04:01:54,840 --> 04:01:57,840
But anything can be before this

3516
04:02:01,000 --> 04:02:03,160
and anything can be after this.

3517
04:02:03,160 --> 04:02:06,680
And this in the middle thing should be

3518
04:02:08,800 --> 04:02:13,640
this right?

3519
04:02:13,640 --> 04:02:15,200
Why? I always forget this.

3520
04:02:15,200 --> 04:02:19,280
We are close.

3521
04:02:19,280 --> 04:02:19,920
Okay,

3522
04:02:22,360 --> 04:02:25,120
So I see all the employers
which are born in fab.

3523
04:02:25,440 --> 04:02:28,400
Can you guys write this
to using underscores

3524
04:02:28,920 --> 04:02:31,720
Also believe

3525
04:02:31,720 --> 04:02:34,680
this is the last thing trust me.

3526
04:02:34,680 --> 04:02:38,040
And then you guys can go

3527
04:02:47,040 --> 04:02:48,080
How many laughs

3528
04:02:48,080 --> 04:02:54,360
This is the final last final that last.

3529
04:02:54,360 --> 04:02:56,320
I don't trust you at this point.

3530
04:02:58,080 --> 04:02:59,360
The last last find.

3531
04:02:59,360 --> 04:03:05,560
The last.

3532
04:03:05,560 --> 04:03:08,080
So how many

3533
04:03:08,080 --> 04:03:09,880
letters are before this?

3534
04:03:09,880 --> 04:03:11,640
One, two, three, four.

3535
04:03:11,640 --> 04:03:12,560
Right before this?

3536
04:03:12,560 --> 04:03:14,880
We have four. One, two, three, four.

3537
04:03:15,560 --> 04:03:18,040
And after this, we have to write

3538
04:03:20,160 --> 04:03:21,280
like this.

3539
04:03:22,200 --> 04:03:24,280
Well,

3540
04:03:24,280 --> 04:03:29,880
Oops.

3541
04:03:29,880 --> 04:03:33,640
Looking to open a new one so that you guys

3542
04:03:34,720 --> 04:03:36,520

04:03:45,360 --> 04:03:46,640

3544
04:03:46,640 --> 04:03:49,160
That's it.

3545
04:03:49,160 --> 04:03:53,280
I think you already covered
three classes to them.

3546
04:03:53,280 --> 04:03:55,680
We know you want to learn
more than Mohammad.

3547
04:03:55,800 --> 04:03:57,840
You're he is your brother.

3548
04:03:58,560 --> 04:04:05,840
Then you're putting the first.

3549
04:04:05,840 --> 04:04:08,040
Okay, guys, think

3550
04:04:09,120 --> 04:04:10,800
compare the characters by using

3551
04:04:10,800 --> 04:04:13,800
like with percentage
or underscore perform divided bar.

3552
04:04:13,800 --> 04:04:17,560
Such person beside you means any character
or number of zeros or more times.

3553
04:04:18,000 --> 04:04:19,440
My husband.

3554
04:04:19,440 --> 04:04:20,040
Okay.

3555
04:04:20,040 --> 04:04:23,280
So you want to beat your husband
right? Then

04:04:24,280 --> 04:04:26,560
please give me two more minutes.

3557
04:04:27,040 --> 04:04:29,840
Character looks for the presence
any on the character.

3558
04:04:30,120 --> 04:04:33,360
Same thing that I that I did or you guys.
