1
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,120
Hello, everyone.

2
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,520
How are you guys doing?

3
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:28,080
So finally, batch 11.

4
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:34,920
Okay, Jimmy, Valerie, who

5
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,680
you are facing, Make sure that you just
posted down in their support.

6
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,400
General,
I'm sure Muhammad is going to be there.

7
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,520
Or maybe she was going to be there.

8
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,080
Maybe they can help you out quickly,
because

9
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:57,680
that's really important.

10
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:13,520
Let me see.

11
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,160
I guess that there will be someone.

12
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:25,640
Muhammad, are you there on support?

13
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,160
Okay. Well, let's see.

14
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,960
So let's wait

15
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,720
a little
for all of the stories to join in.

16
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:40,640
And then we will begin
our introduction session.

17
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,200
And by the way, I'm really glad
that you guys are very punctual,

18
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,240
Like you guys just join in before, like 2

19
00:07:49,240 --> 00:08:50,240
minutes.

20
00:08:51,920 --> 00:09:01,640
Maryam, Which screen
are you talking about?

21
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,320
Okay, so that's totally fine.

22
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:07,920
It's just

23
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,960
a text editor that I have on my screen.

24
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,920
Oh, well, that's a secret.

25
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:44,520
I'll let you know.

26
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,000
Nah, nothing messy.

27
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,960
You missed nothing.

28
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,640
I'm just waiting for the rest of us

29
00:09:52,640 --> 00:10:30,120
to join in.

30
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,400
Okay.

31
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,560
So how are you guys?

32
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,880
How has it been?

33
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,840
I guess you guys join in.

34
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,920
It's been now one month, right
since the beginning of your session.

35
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,800
The five correct about it.

36
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,880
Okay, so it's October,
I guess you guys joined

37
00:10:53,880 --> 00:11:01,320
in November, right?

38
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,200
Over September.

39
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,960
Like the end of September, right?

40
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,800
Okay. September.

41
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,160
So it's been like

42
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,320
two months, right?

43
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,640
Oh, I'm really sorry.

44
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,960
I'm just sitting here.

45
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,600
Yeah. Okay.

46
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,440
I'm just messing up with the months,
I guess.

47
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,480
Yeah. After September, we got up to.

48
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,120
I was just like, of the idea.

49
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,160
Maybe November comes before

50
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,120
that happened sometime.

51
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,560
You know?

52
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,880
So by far, it's been one month.

53
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,000
How are you guys taking everything?

54
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,240
Are you guys enjoying whatever

55
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:57,840
you are learning?

56
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,200
I guess you guys must have started
about learning

57
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,040
Java, right?

58
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,800
Okay, that.

59
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,200
That's good.

60
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:15,320
And of yet
I guess you have been taught by ASL

61
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,720
and similar right.

62
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,240
Okay.

63
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,480
So as were you had your sessions with us
learn to offer

64
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,080
some don't worry you and get along

65
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,240
okay.

66
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,320
They are all so perfect.

67
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,240
Well now.

68
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,240
So that's completely fine.

69
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,920
Trust me,
this course is designed in such a way

70
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,880
that it's
going to take you all to a full level

71
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,000
by the end of, I guess, three months.

72
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,440
You guys are going
to, you know, who are a little bit

73
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,640
behind or, you know, slowed down.

74
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,120
You guys will catch
up. Don't worry about that.

75
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,560
But just make sure
that you are putting in effort.

76
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,360
Okay.

77
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,280
And that effort should be
that you are attending classes attentively

78
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,320
and doing your homework.

79
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:18,880
That's it.

80
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,040
If you are doing that,
you guys are going to be really

81
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:30,600
good.

82
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,080
I'll share my experience about this.

83
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:37,920
In the last batch, which was batch ten,
there were a few students

84
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,960
in the starting of a 1 to 1.5 months.

85
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,800
They were real.

86
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,760
They were real slow.

87
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,680
But now when I see them,
I get really amazed with the,

88
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:52,200
you know, with the pace that they are.

89
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,920
They have gassed up everything
and how they have joined others.

90
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,600
So it's all going to be good.

91
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:26,240
Just get motivated.

92
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,200
Okay. So

93
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,240
let me first introduce myself
and then I'll like

94
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,920
to have a little introduction of you guys
before we begin our first session.

95
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:46,120
So my name is Mazen.

96
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,880
As you guys already know,

97
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,640
I've been in the ICT sector
for the past four years

98
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:58,200
and I have worked
with in different companies

99
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,200
on different projects
regarding automation,

100
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,920
testing, machine
learning as well in various languages.

101
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,720
Java by Tim C-sharp, C++,

102
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,800
and I've been with Sentech
since last one year.

103
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,960
I've done around four batches and

104
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,200
till now it's going all great.

105
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,760
I'm really enjoying it all.

106
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,920
And that's, I guess, from my side.

107
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,760
Now it's your turn.

108
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,720
So first of all,

109
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,040
I want you guys to tell me that

110
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,560
How many of you

111
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,680
already have

112
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:50,520
an iPad background?

113
00:15:51,800 --> 00:16:02,960
Okay.

114
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:06,000
Oh, yeah, perfect.

115
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,600
I'm really glad to see the replies.

116
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:26,760
If you are a guy, if you guys
are being honest, that's totally fine.

117
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,520
Okay, so

118
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,560
how many of you know

119
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:40,640
how to use a computer?

120
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,000
Okay, now, see,
we all know how to use computers,

121
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:55,920
so that that's a win win situation, right?

122
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,960
Okay, let's you are the odd one out,

123
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,200
but we'll make sure that you learn with us

124
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,560
for how.

125
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,560
Come on, man.

126
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,600
Computer is a black box. Testing.

127
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:29,840
Where did you come up with that?

128
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,280
Oh, okay.

129
00:17:32,280 --> 00:18:06,720
Okay. So

130
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,680
in my classes,

131
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:15,000
I have my own,
you know, pattern of teaching.

132
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,840
I like to communicate a lot
because it's good

133
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,400
to have an interactive session,
whether we are, you know, just

134
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,280
discussing some technical stuff or,
you know, in between.

135
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:32,880
If we are getting to know each other
better, because that's obviously

136
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,600
create a common ground
where we can come to the same base

137
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,480
and add value to each of those life.

138
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,560
Honestly,

139
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:46,640
you guys will be learning a lot from me
and I will be learning a lot from you.

140
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,520
So it's a win win situation.

141
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,680
So I will encourage
all the fellows that are out there

142
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,440
to be very interactive, very active and,

143
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:20,160
you know, be open about everything.

144
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,280
So we have some rules

145
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,720
that I always

146
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,440
I don't
always mention them in the start of,

147
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,160
you know, session,
but for this class, I'll mention one rule

148
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,520
is anyone in this

149
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,160
is anyone here
who knows Russian or other languages,

150
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,120
like apart from English?

151
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,400
Okay,

152
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,240
so you guys doing all that?

153
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:51,760
Okay, guys.

154
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,560
So the rule one is that you guys
will not be chatting in other languages.

155
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,880
Okay? I want to see what you are typing.

156
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:03,000
Okay, So usually what happens
is that the friends that start

157
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,480
communicating in other languages
and I'm like, What are you typing guys?

158
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,760
So don't do that.

159
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:15,520
I'll get perfect.

160
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,480
Sebastian What do you expect?

161
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,120
I like you.

162
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,760
Want me to Google
that and teach the class at the same time?

163
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:29,520
No, Matt, I cannot do that.

164
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,360
I trust you, Farhad.

165
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:50,280
I trust you.

166
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,560
Okay, so it says Milan.

167
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,320
Am I looking at

168
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:04,080
not Madeleine? Oh,

169
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,240
no, I don't know.

170
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,360
It's AC Milan or something.

171
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,200
It's maybe just Milan.

172
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,040
I think it's.

173
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,040
It's a place.

174
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:16,440
Good one.

175
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:28,200
Marwin.

176
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:33,120
Okay, there you go.

177
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:42,240
Serbian.

178
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:53,360
Seriously,
You guys have already started doing that.

179
00:21:53,360 --> 00:22:02,520
So who is the manager here?

180
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,480
Okay, Sebastian.

181
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:15,360
And who came up with the idea?

182
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:21,120
Okay, as well. Did.

183
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:31,680
I'll have to talk to us about this.

184
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,320
Okay. So do you guys have great managers?

185
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,440
Yeah.

186
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,080
Who is the break manager?

187
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,720
Okay, so you
you guys have to, in fact, interview.

188
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,080
You will find out

189
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,960
there is going to be one person
who is going to be a great manager

190
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,480
who's responsible to remind me

191
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,560
and the students that you guys

192
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,920
need to have. Great.

193
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:59,360
But I guess that it's it's

194
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,400
a rule that we cannot choose a person for

195
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,080
the role

196
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,080
chooses the person itself
over the period of time.

197
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,800
So it's automatically, you know,

198
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:14,280
going to appear after maybe two months.

199
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,320
No, no, Michael, trust me with that.

200
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,000
There's going to be one person
after two months who is going to take

201
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:35,080
that responsibility.

202
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,440
Okay.

203
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,160
It seems like
you guys are already having a lot of fun.

204
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,840
I'm recording. Yes.

205
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,400
How can I not record this fun session?

206
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,760
Come on.

207
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:59,640
I can forget to record the actual class,
but not this one.

208
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,400
We need to use Adam.

209
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,600
No, Alex, you don't have to use Adam.

210
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,280
It's just a text editor.

211
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,000
Okay.

212
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,760
Okay, guys. So

213
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,360
let's start our session, if that's okay.

214
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:22,600
You guys only need to have GID,
and that will be sufficient

215
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:34,840
enough for this class.

216
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,720
Okay, So did you guys watch the video

217
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:45,400
that I sent?

218
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,800
Okay, perfect.

219
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:53,040
And anyone who is still having problem
with installation of good

220
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,120
please guys support channel is there.

221
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,120
I won't be able to help you in the life
class with the installation.

222
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:05,640
It was supposed to be done before
the class, so now you still have time.

223
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,760
Go to the support.

224
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,120
I guess there will be someone
who can help you out.

225
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:13,080
Okay, so just push your issue

226
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:17,040
with your.

227
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:17,760
Okay, great.

228
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,040
So you guys watched video of that.

229
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:26,880
That's really good.

230
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,400
Okay, so first thing that I would like
to mention before we begin the session,

231
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:35,240
you guys do not need to take any notes

232
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,400
for my classes regarding GED.

233
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,560
I promise you that I will be giving you

234
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:47,640
very detailed, very interesting notes,
and you guys will be satisfied with that.

235
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,520
That's my promise.

236
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:53,280
So just pay attention to the class
and with whatever stuff we are doing,

237
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:59,160
try to be attentive on that
and the responsibility of notes is on me.

238
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:25,240
Just forget, okay? So

239
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,720
we will be learning get

240
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,120
we have two classes
and we will try to move real slow

241
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:38,960
and everyone is encouraged
to ask questions, whatever

242
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,640
he is confused about, you can always,
you know, push your question and lecture.

243
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,400
I'll try to answer as much as I can.

244
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,880
And obviously for the technical problems
you have support channels,

245
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,080
post your screenshots over there
so that you can seek help immediately.

246
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,680
So let's start our session.

247
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:02,560
So what do you guys know that?

248
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:06,240
Why do we need it in the first place?

249
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:38,640
What do you guys think?

250
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,720
Okay,
so the first question, is that right?

251
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:57,960
So let's try to answer that.

252
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,360
Okay?

253
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:02,240
So let's assume that we are

254
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,480
working on some Java code, right?

255
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,600
And you already are familiar with Java.

256
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:16,280
So I think this example
is going to be good enough.

257
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,680
One day you wrote the code
and you added the functionality

258
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:31,040
of addition and subtraction.

259
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,720
The other day you

260
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,160
open the same file

261
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,840
and you added that code
and add some more functionality

262
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:44,360
like, Let's see that the next day
you just decided to say that,

263
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:48,280
okay, let's add
the operations for division

264
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:57,720
and multiplication.

265
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,800
You changed your code.

266
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,400
It was working fine, everything was good.

267
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:06,600
So you just closed down your PC
and you slept on.

268
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:11,760
Next day you woke up again and you wanted
to modify your code a little bit more

269
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,880
and you know, you want to actually enhance
the operations

270
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,160
that your calculator can perform.

271
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,800
So you added some more functionality.

272
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,440
And let's see that you added the

273
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,240
super load

274
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:38,160
and modulus.

275
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,400
But at this point in time,

276
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,680
when you check your code,

277
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,680
it was not working fine.

278
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,120
There were some errors in it.

279
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,040
Now what are you

280
00:29:52,040 --> 00:30:07,440
going to do?

281
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,800
Okay, so you had one file

282
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,600
and off yet you have created

283
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,760
no backup, right?

284
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:35,280
You do not have any backup file.

285
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:35,720
Exactly.

286
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:41,880
Remember of now we do not have any good
we do not have any backup.

287
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,480
We are editing the same file.

288
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,800
We are in the same code right.

289
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,560
Okay.

290
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,080
So if set in such a scenario,
we do not have backup.

291
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,720
So what we will have to do,
We just lost the code

292
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:03,360
for addition, subtraction,
division and multiplication.

293
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,400
And at this point,
if some of our friend calls

294
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:12,480
us, for example,
Amelia calls Aisha and say that he.

295
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,720
Aisha, can you share your code
with me of addition and subtraction?

296
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:22,920
Well, I shall be able to share her code.

297
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,920
No, because it's not working. Great.

298
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,680
So I. She is going to say that.

299
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,080
Hey, I'm really sorry.

300
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,200
It was working fine till yesterday, but

301
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,400
I added some functionality
and now it's not working.

302
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,120
Correct.

303
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:40,720
So what I need to do,
I have to make it correct or maybe delete

304
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,640
the additional functionalities
and then send you that

305
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,400
amount.

306
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,600
Yes, you can. But

307
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,480
let's assume that the scenarios are very

308
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,440
complicated and there is a lot of good,
then you won't be able to do that.

309
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,680
I have built up a very simple example
just for the concept.

310
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:14,960
Okay, so what do you guys

311
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,720
suggest
can be the solution to this problem?

312
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,880
Remember,
we do not know about it at the moment.

313
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:39,120
Okay, So one of the solution can be

314
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,600
that when we created the first code

315
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,360
of addition and subtraction,

316
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:51,040
the next time when we want to add
some more functionality,

317
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:58,880
we make a copy of it.

318
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,200
And instead of

319
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,120
editing the previous file,

320
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:14,040
we edit the new copy of that file.

321
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:18,200
And similarly, if you want to add
some more functionality,

322
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:41,240
we make again a copy.

323
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,560
So what do you guys think that

324
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,800
what is the disadvantage

325
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:59,760
of this approach?

326
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:04,840
Okay, the first thing is
that there is going to be a lot of copies

327
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:12,920
on our system right?

328
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:16,560
Apart from that,
if we are dealing with a huge project,

329
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,280
we may run out of space launch system

330
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,840
and let's see that.

331
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,880
Okay, these two problems,

332
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,840
we need to find a way to tackle them

333
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,480
just tells me that if you make like

334
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,240
let's say 50 copies

335
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,680
and you want to go back
to one specific one,

336
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:44,600
how are you going to actually navigate
back to that particular

337
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:48,480
copy in which
your desired functionality is?

338
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:54,440
It's going to be really hard
for you, right?

339
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,480
Yes, you can name them, but

340
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:01,040
how many are you going to name
and how many naming conventions

341
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,040
are you going to use?

342
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,320
Yes, they tend to

343
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,080
write or you can use date and time.

344
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,200
But again,
you will be doing a lot of mental effort

345
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:15,600
right.

346
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:28,160
Which is going to make everything
very hard to maintain.

347
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:28,560
Okay.

348
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,920
So this problem came and, you know,

349
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,480
one day

350
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,440
a person was working on his project

351
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,640
and he encountered this problem
and he was very sad.

352
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,560
So what he did,

353
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:47,000
he went out in the jungle
and he just found a magic lab.

354
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:52,400
So he thought that
maybe this lamp could help him.

355
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,440
So he just grabbed it
and a genie appeared.

356
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:00,080
So the genie asked him for three wishes.

357
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,240
And you know what he asked

358
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:12,640
in his first wish.

359
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,440
No, he did not ask about get you?

360
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,800
No, not.

361
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,960
Not money.

362
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,600
No. Allen.

363
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,200
Exactly.
The genie said that it's impossible

364
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,760
now. So he asked the genie that I would

365
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:36,120
my first wishes to provide me with a tool

366
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,760
that can help me manage

367
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:44,160
all the cause that I'm writing.

368
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:51,840
So the genie told him that he
you can use get.

369
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:57,640
So from there, actually,
you know, give came in.

370
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,720
Christine Yes.

371
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:06,360
It's a true story.

372
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:11,760
It was around 9pmi think it was.

373
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,920
I forgot the exact day.

374
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:19,040
But from the time he was,
I guess from 1970s to 2010,

375
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:25,200
I guess, and these 40 years,
it happened somewhere.

376
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:36,640
So, yeah.

377
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,360
Okay.

378
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:40,080
So now we will be moving upon

379
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:44,040
the next thing that

380
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:48,960
what is

381
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:55,200
good.

382
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,400
Okay, guys, before I jump into
what is good, I want you guys to tell me,

383
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,520
are you clear about

384
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,840
the first point?

385
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:17,480
Why do we need good.

386
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:21,400
Okay, so now let's discuss that.

387
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,200
What is okay?

388
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,640
But before that,
we need to discuss one more point,

389
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,280
which is versions.

390
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,960
Okay, So what are you glad
that is already know about a version?

391
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:52,440
What is a version?

392
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,240
Okay, so

393
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,600
let's let's think about it.

394
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:00,200
As you all use Facebook and Instagram,

395
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:07,840
right?

396
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:13,080
So every time you get this update
of your WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook,

397
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:24,000
what are you actually doing?

398
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,040
You are updating it.

399
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:30,960
You are installing new features or changes

400
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:39,160
that are in that application, right?

401
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:43,680
So we can see that any change in the code

402
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,280
creates new version

403
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:53,160
of it.

404
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:59,280
Makes sense.

405
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:04,000
So let's say that this is my code
for addition and subtraction.

406
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:08,040
I added it and, and I added

407
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,920
some functionality of

408
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,440
just multiplication.

409
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,840
So what can we call this first code that I

410
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,640
what kind of call it?

411
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,760
I can call it version one

412
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,240
and what should I call the second one

413
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,960
was and two.

414
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:45,520
Okay, I can also go call it 1.1,
you know, 1.01.

415
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:50,160
This convention will vary depending upon,
you know, the organization

416
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,320
that you are working in.

417
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,240
What's the convention they are using?

418
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:58,480
It can vary.

419
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:58,920
Okay.

420
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,160
So now you guys know that.

421
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:06,360
What is the version right?

422
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:06,720
Okay.

423
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:20,280
So now let's move ahead.

424
00:41:20,280 --> 00:42:39,320
Yeah.

425
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:39,640
Okay.

426
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,920
So let's say that there is a point
who rise

427
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,280
to who likes to write poems.

428
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:51,240
So what he wants to do is that he wants

429
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:55,000
that his every writing is being saved

430
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,040
in a locker room that he has in his room.

431
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,560
So what he needs to do,

432
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,800
he needs to honor whatever he writes.

433
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,120
He needs to pick it up.

434
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:13,200
Let's say that he wrote some

435
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:13,680
poetry.

436
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,280
He needs to pick it up
and place it in the shelf.

437
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:21,680
And if he wants to manage it perfectly,

438
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,000
what he needs to do, he needs to label it

439
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:28,600
with time, date

440
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:46,440
and name.

441
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:50,640
So the next day
when he's going to write something new,

442
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,920
what he will have to do,
he will again have

443
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,000
to place it on the next show

444
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:00,200
and he will have to label it with

445
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:06,120
time did and name

446
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,320
and so on as he works.

447
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:13,920
And he will have to do this process
over and over again

448
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:19,560
so that whenever he wants to go back
to one of his previous writing,

449
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:24,000
he can't simply just
by looking at the label, do that.

450
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:28,920
So do you guys think that
this technique of organization is going

451
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:32,240
to make it very easy
for him to get back to

452
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:37,120
any of his previous writing?

453
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,040
Right.

454
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,600
But now do you guys also think that,

455
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:46,440
for example,
if he's writing a lot of things,

456
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:50,800
do you guys think it's going to be hard
for him to place everything,

457
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:55,440
label it, and,
you know, actually manage that stuff?

458
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,560
Is it going to be hard for him?

459
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,520
Yes, it will be hard for him.

460
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,960
So what

461
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:07,240
what if he just hires this minion

462
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,640
and says that I'm not going to manage this
cupboard?

463
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,400
Can you do it for me?

464
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,640
I'm just going to tell you
that this is the writing that I wrote

465
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:21,840
and I'm going to give you

466
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:24,080
some very basic information like

467
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,640
the name

468
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:30,320
and, you know, maybe version number.

469
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:35,240
Can you manage the rest of stuff
on your own?

470
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,720
Minion is going to say, Yes,
I'll do that work for you.

471
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,560
So he's just going to give him,
you know, his writing along with the name

472
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,760
and the rest of the stuff
is going to be taken care

473
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:49,440
of by this particular minion

474
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,520
and he's going to manage everything
in this

475
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,840
cupboard that he has.

476
00:45:55,840 --> 00:46:00,960
So now, guys, now tell me that does
does this technique

477
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:09,840
helps him organize everything better?

478
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:15,480
It's now it becomes even easier for him
to, you know, manage everything.

479
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:20,280
And let's just say that he wants to
get back to any of his previous writing.

480
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:23,800
You can just tell them, Minion,
that he can you go back to

481
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,400
you know, the writing with the name

482
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:31,400
this which I gave you,
and Minion is going to go and put

483
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:38,360
it from the cupboard for him
and he's going to get that.

484
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:45,040
So now let's replace try to replace this
example with get So you guys

485
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:49,480
can imagine that instead of this writer

486
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,160
there is a programmer

487
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,400
or a tester who is writing codes

488
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,720
and this cupboard

489
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,560
is still there

490
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:09,400
inside your computer
and whatever code you are writing,

491
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:15,160
this minion is taking care of that
and he is managing it, labeling it

492
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:19,360
and placing it in the

493
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:26,720
cupboard.

494
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:44,400
And he's going to label everything
as he puts.

495
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,840
Okay, so let's say that this person

496
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:58,760
who is writing is John.

497
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:02,760
What is this minion going to be?

498
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:09,880
What do who is this minion?

499
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,960
Yeah, remember I told that V.I.

500
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,880
trying to implement that example

501
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:17,480
in our computer right?

502
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,600
This minion is actually gift

503
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:35,120
and the cupboard that we have

504
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:38,960
this particular cupboard

505
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:40,840
or locker room, whatever

506
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:44,200
you want to said we call it

507
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:48,480
in terms of computer,
we call it breakfast.

508
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:49,520
Jeffrey

509
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,360
up to this point,

510
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:07,400
is everything clear to you guys that how

511
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,440
what is it actually

512
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,600
any questions

513
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:19,200
that you may have?

514
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:30,240
Okay, perfect.

515
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,600
So now

516
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:36,600
if get is taking care of

517
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,840
every code that we are writing
and we said that

518
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,800
each changes in the code

519
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,920
is called a virgin.

520
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:50,120
So can I see while defining get that

521
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:52,920
get is a virgin

522
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:56,760
control tool.

523
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:00,160
Can I see that?

524
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,320
It makes sense, right?

525
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:02,400
Because

526
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,720
Kate is actually

527
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:09,840
tracking
all the versions it's managed in them.

528
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:14,560
So I can see that gate is a virgin control
tool, right?

529
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:18,000
So let's quickly define get

530
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:25,920
get is a version control tool

531
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:31,840
that keep tracks

532
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:35,480
of all the changes

533
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,560
that we make in our code

534
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,800
and told them

535
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:50,160
in the repository.

536
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:57,080
Okay, so is there anyone who does
not understand this definition?

537
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,640
Okay. So for hard.

538
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,280
No, just you know, the guys with it,
we will be coming.

539
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,640
I'll answer your all questions

540
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:07,800
over the period of time.

541
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,560
Just for now. Go with the flow.

542
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,000
Okay.

543
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,760
They they will be automatically answered

544
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:18,360
as you move forward.

545
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:22,920
You'll need to you will be given
that answer to over the period of time.

546
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:23,640
Okay.

547
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:29,600
I'm still not done.

548
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:29,880
Okay.

549
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:35,040
Anyone who does not understand
that why we wrote this definition

550
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:47,120
or are we all good?

551
00:51:47,120 --> 00:52:06,600
Okay, perfect.

552
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:19,360
I think this is what Diego says right?

553
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,080
Okay.

554
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,800
So now I have one question for you guys.

555
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,760
This repository

556
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,680
that I'm talking about,

557
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:57,640
where is it located?

558
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:03,560
Okay, So this is something that we need
to, you know, I think pay attention to.

559
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:07,520
So this repository or cupboard that

560
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:13,720
gate is organizing everything into
is located on your machine.

561
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,920
Whatever you are using. Mac

562
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:20,320
windows or any other computer,
if you are using

563
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:24,240
it's located on your machine,

564
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:31,560
not in the cloud.

565
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:38,800
Okay.

566
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:42,680
So you can see that

567
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:46,920
gate is a motion control tool
that keeps track of all changes

568
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:50,120
that we make in our code
and stores them in the

569
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,160
local repository.

570
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,600
Can I see that?

571
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:55,880
Because

572
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:58,320
this repository resides on

573
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,520
our computer, right?

574
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:09,800
So that's what local repository.

575
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:18,440
Okay, So now

576
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:26,520
the next thing that we will be learning,
okay,

577
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:39,840
someone wanted me to zoom in
at this point.

578
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:43,720
Okay, Ed,

579
00:54:43,720 --> 00:55:04,560
are we good?

580
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:07,400
Someone asked me the question
That is good for me.

581
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:10,280
Yes Get is open source.

582
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:17,640
It's totally free.

583
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:20,280
Do we have any other version
control tools?

584
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,720
Yes, we have, but

585
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:24,240
the most

586
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:28,360
popular one that is being used in
the industry is GED.

587
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:43,080
So we only learn get.

588
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:47,480
Okay,

589
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:52,040
so we were discussing the problem
that we can, you know, hired

590
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:55,840
get to manage our code and stuff
in the repository.

591
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,440
We discussed that.

592
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:00,000
So the next problem that we have is

593
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:05,960
we need to somehow communicate
to get in order

594
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:10,560
to tell him that, okay,
this is the name of the

595
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:14,400
version that we want to store

596
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:17,800
in our locker room,
which we now call repository.

597
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:21,320
So what do you guys suggest that

598
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:23,440
how can we talk to get

599
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,720
Okay, so now,

600
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:04,040
just like we know over here, we

601
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,400
we speak different languages, right?

602
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,120
Few of you speak Russian.

603
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:13,120
If you speak me maybe
speaking Spanish and stuff,

604
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:18,600
but now we come to a common ground
and we decide a common language,

605
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:21,480
which is English,
so that we all can communicate.

606
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:21,880
Right?

607
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:25,200
So similar with GED,

608
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:29,040
we have a common ground
in which we can communicate.

609
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:32,680
And what are those?

610
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:34,600
What are those

611
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,600
commands?

612
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:42,880
No, no, Sebastian, not binary.

613
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:54,600
Those are common.

614
00:57:54,600 --> 00:58:10,080
Okay, So what are these commands?

615
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:12,480
These are unique style commands.

616
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:25,800
Okay?

617
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:31,280
Now we know that it is going to be able
to understand if we give it some commands,

618
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:34,640
but where do we actually give

619
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:46,960
those commands?

620
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:49,120
Okay, so for that,

621
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:53,280
we have a software for Windows,

622
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,720
which is get Bash

623
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:10,600
on Mac.

624
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:13,040
We have terminal

625
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:18,800
where we can give

626
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:28,800
these commands.

627
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:29,640
Okay.

628
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:32,440
So now you guys might be thinking that

629
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:37,600
for Windows we have Get Bash
and for Mac we have terminal.

630
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:42,000
So is there going to be any difference
when we give the commands,

631
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:43,680
something like that?

632
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:49,280
So I want to mention over here
that there is going to be no difference.

633
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:53,400
Everything is going to remain
same for Windows users

634
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:57,520
as well as Mac users.

635
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:01,840
The only thing which is different
is that for Windows we use Get Bash

636
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:19,160
and for Mac, we use the terminal.

637
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:24,960
No, you cannot use Chromebook.

638
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:29,400
How about on iPhone or Android?

639
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:37,200
You have to get older.

640
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,000
Do you have the eclipse? All older to

641
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:46,600
Are you writing your chords?

642
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:50,280
All right on iPhone, right.

643
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:54,560
No. Remember get

644
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:57,840
is just used for managing your quotes.

645
01:00:57,840 --> 01:00:59,640
Nothing else right?

646
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:01,800
So you only need it.

647
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:02,840
Various codes are.

648
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:08,520
And those are in your computer right.

649
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:09,320
Okay.

650
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:12,720
So at this point

651
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:17,840
we will before
jumping into using actual get,

652
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,880
we will try to learn some very basic UNIX

653
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:32,760
commands.

654
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:33,520
Okay.

655
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:37,320
So why do we need to learn these commands

656
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,880
is get bash separate software

657
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:48,360
get bash is going to come in same package

658
01:01:48,600 --> 01:02:06,240
if you install it on Windows.

659
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:07,040
Okay.

660
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:12,000
So these basics come at a basic command
that we are going to learn right now.

661
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:15,400
We will be learning them.

662
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:18,840
We will be using them to actually navigate

663
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:29,320
into our into our machine.

664
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:31,560
Why do we need to navigate
into our machine?

665
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:35,400
We will discuss that once
we have learned these commands.

666
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:38,000
Okay.

667
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:42,760
Are you guys

668
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:58,960
with me?

669
01:02:58,960 --> 01:02:59,280
Okay.

670
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:04,200
So now I hope that everyone has installed

671
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:08,520
GID on their machines and now
we will be learning these commands.

672
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:10,560
So try to follow me,

673
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:13,320
whatever I'm doing.

674
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:17,160
And then, you know, if if anyone, if you

675
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,720
this is any problem,

676
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:24,000
just go to the support, if any question is
there, you can ask them.

677
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:26,600
Okay.

678
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:33,320
So the first step, open your get bash

679
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,440
and Windows.

680
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:39,440
And for Mac users, it's going to be

681
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:50,080
open your terminal.

682
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:55,000
So I have windows
so I'll go to search bar type in git bash

683
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:58,320
and it will appear in the search and

684
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:12,840
I'll just simply click on it.

685
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:13,200
Okay.

686
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:27,600
Let me know when you guys have done this.

687
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:28,360
Okay.

688
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:34,200
So I'm going to zoom it a little bit.

689
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,840
That's fine For Windows user.

690
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:37,280
We have it.

691
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:41,680
BASH And for Mac users, the terminal
I have a Chromebook

692
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:49,560
and a terminal.

693
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:50,240
Michael

694
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:03,120
like a

695
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:05,920
you are not on Mac.

696
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:10,560
Weren't
you supposed to have Mac or Windows.

697
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:13,760
I don't think that you knew

698
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:37,560
you were supposed to have a Linux system.

699
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:37,920
Okay.

700
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:41,640
So what we need to do,
we need to click on this Windows

701
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:47,520
and over here we need to type
in, get bash and press enter.

702
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:50,440
Okay, So it's going to open this up.

703
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:58,240
Well, Michael, if you are on Linux,
because I'm not sure about that,

704
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:01,600
I think that you are not supposed
to have Linux,

705
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:05,280
but over there also you can open up

706
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:09,480
the terminal and, you know, work
just like the Mac users are

707
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:12,400
working is going to be
pretty much the same for Linux also.

708
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:15,640
Okay. Just

709
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:18,240
in order to zoom in

710
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:21,520
and you just need
to cool control and scroll up

711
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:24,200
or click on

712
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:33,400
plus plus.

713
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:35,560
Yeah, you can open up the terminal.

714
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:38,760
Michael Okay, so the first command

715
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:42,480
that we will be learning is

716
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:45,120
who am I?

717
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:48,640
So let's type down
where am I in the terminal

718
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:54,560
and press enter.

719
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:57,960
I want you guys to paste your output

720
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:00,600
in the live chat.

721
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:24,280
Just Christine,

722
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:28,560
can you share the screenshot

723
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:31,320
of what you are having?

724
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:33,440
Okay. When my

725
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:36,720
so. Okay,

726
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:38,040
very good.

727
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:46,680
Very good.

728
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:51,040
Remember,

729
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:54,000
there is no space between who am I?

730
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:54,640
Okay.

731
01:07:54,640 --> 01:08:01,320
It has to be without a space.

732
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:03,040
Okay. Don't send me screenshot.

733
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:06,680
Just copy this where my text
and you can paste simply that.

734
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:09,120
Okay. That will be much better.

735
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:09,360
Okay.

736
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:12,600
So what is your terminal telling you

737
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:22,360
right now?

738
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:36,360
It is telling you the name
that you have given to your computer.

739
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:51,200
Yes, exactly.

740
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:55,280
And this name is obviously going
to be different for every one.

741
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:58,160
My computer name is HPC X

742
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:01,200
and yours is going to be different.

743
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:03,280
Well,

744
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:06,560
Farhad, that
trust me, that will make no difference.

745
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:14,880
Knowing your computer name,
I cannot hack into that. Tom.

746
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:17,160
I know you are.
You are perfectly doing well.

747
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:20,240
Anyone having issues with this?

748
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:22,160
The support is there, right?

749
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:26,520
You guys can send screenshot
over there and get help.

750
01:09:26,520 --> 01:10:03,400
Okay, so the command is who am I?

751
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:08,000
Okay, now

752
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:14,160
let's imagine that this terminal
is actually

753
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:18,840
a person in your computer.

754
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:22,480
Okay.

755
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:26,200
Are we all good with this assumption
that this computer

756
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:29,240
is like a person to whom we can talk?

757
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:35,920
And he talks back,
so we just ask him that Who am I?

758
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:39,960
And he told it
that your computer is HPC X.

759
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:43,680
So now what we want to do,

760
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:47,400
we want to ask the terminal that, Hey Mr.

761
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:52,080
Terminal, what is your current location

762
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:55,920
in the computer?

763
01:10:55,920 --> 01:11:00,680
Because you know, inside your computer
you have desktop

764
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:05,720
documents, downloads and you know, a
lot of other folders and files.

765
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:12,280
Your terminal can be anywhere, right?

766
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:20,400
So in order to know that the terminal is
right now, we need to ask him.

767
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:23,680
And for that we have a command which is

768
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:33,200
TWD, So let's first type them down

769
01:11:33,440 --> 01:12:16,360
so anyone who is skipping out
can catch up.

770
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:20,360
Okay, so let's write down TWD and let's

771
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:24,960
see where our terminal is right now.

772
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:29,480
So do you guys think that we all will be
having different results

773
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:39,680
or the same result?

774
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:40,680
Different right.

775
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:43,040
Because and everyone computer

776
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:46,600
the location of the terminal
is going to be different, right?

777
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:48,520
It's going to be different for me.

778
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:52,800
It's going to be different for you.

779
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:53,160
Okay.

780
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:56,520
So my terminal is currently

781
01:12:56,520 --> 01:13:00,320
in C users

782
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:03,960
and HPC X

783
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:12,880
I'm I'm coming

784
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:22,000
to that go.

785
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:22,640
Okay, perfect.

786
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:27,600
So you see for everyone
the location is different.

787
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:30,720
B For my units users.

788
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:35,480
Maryam Abedi for do is abduction users.

789
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:38,560
Abdullah Shinwari
And for the rest of you, it's also going

790
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:44,240
to be different right?

791
01:13:44,240 --> 01:14:03,440
Perfect.

792
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:06,160
So what does PWT

793
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:23,840
stands for?

794
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:27,720
Friend Working Directory

795
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:33,840
or in

796
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:36,840
some case we can also see
a present working directory.

797
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:42,000
So what do we understand from the term
Framed Working directory?

798
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:57,720
We will come to that.

799
01:14:57,720 --> 01:14:59,640
Okay, so the pwt come out.

800
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:03,120
Is there
anyone who is still confused about

801
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:26,760
what does this command do
and is unable to execute it?

802
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:30,240
Know how to do?

803
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:31,360
Remember,

804
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:35,160
don't complicate

805
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:37,320
the knowledge that you have and mix it up.

806
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:40,360
Just understand

807
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:42,680
we are moving from very basic steps.

808
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:46,160
So what I told you,
I told you that you open up your terminal

809
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:51,240
and when you want to know that where
your terminal is standing, you use PWT.

810
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:53,200
Okay, so that's it.

811
01:15:53,200 --> 01:16:03,000
That's all we know so far.

812
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:15,840
Okay, Get back.

813
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:17,040
It's good, Bash.

814
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:19,240
It's not good.

815
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:22,280
I'll explain it to you

816
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:27,640
that what is a terminal?

817
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:30,840
Okay, So first, let's move on to the

818
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:34,120
next command, which is else.

819
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:41,480
Okay, so

820
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:44,520
let's simply write down L.S.

821
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:48,520
and let's first see that

822
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:56,160
What does this command do?

823
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:58,200
Okay, For me, it's printing out,

824
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:01,360
you know, different

825
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:05,320
files.

826
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:06,280
Okay,

827
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:10,040
so this command, Alice,

828
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:14,560
what we are telling,
what we are asking Mr.

829
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:20,080
Terminal.

830
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:20,760
Hey, Mr.

831
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:28,920
Terminal, can you please tell us that

832
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:34,200
in your current location

833
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:39,960
where you are standing,

834
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:43,920
what are the files and folders

835
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:51,360
present over there?

836
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:53,880
Okay, so what you want to ask Mr.

837
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:54,840
Terminal that?

838
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:57,280
What are the files and folders

839
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:00,240
in the location where he's standing?

840
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:02,400
We use the command L.

841
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:07,440
S list ten for list content.

842
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:10,720
Okay.

843
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:26,400
Makes sense.

844
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:30,120
Okay, so at this point, I want to mention

845
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:33,360
one thing.

846
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:36,240
Folders can

847
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:41,440
are also called

848
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:45,000
decrease.

849
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,480
Okay, so we can

850
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:52,360
interchangeably use the terms
folders and directories.

851
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:57,240
So I don't want you guys to get confused
if I use the term directory.

852
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:00,360
So whenever I use the term directory,
what does it refer to

853
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:04,640
folder.

854
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:05,040
Right.

855
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:13,120
And we all know that
what a folder is, right?

856
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:23,720
Okay. So

857
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:28,200
if we want to clear everything

858
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:33,400
that we have written on our terminal,
you can just use the command clear

859
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:37,960
and it's going to erase everything
that we have written until this point.

860
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:40,560
So let's do one thing.

861
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:43,880
Let's write down clear and press enter.

862
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:48,000
Okay?

863
01:19:48,000 --> 01:20:13,840
Let's erase
everything that we have written.

864
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:20,520
So now the first thing that I want to do
is I want to ask the terminal

865
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:25,320
the name of my computer.

866
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,920
So what command will I use

867
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:34,440
exactly?

868
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:38,520
So I will say, who am I?

869
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:39,880
And it tells me that you are.

870
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:42,640
It speaks, right? Okay.

871
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:47,040
So now the next thing,
which I want to ask Mr.

872
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:49,280
Terminal, is that here is a terminal.

873
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,960
Where are you currently?

874
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:57,480
In my computer.

875
01:20:57,480 --> 01:20:58,400
So I let's say

876
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:02,640
p wd.

877
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:07,200
It's telling me that I am in C users
s p c x.

878
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:08,400
Okay.

879
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:11,120
At this point in time,

880
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:13,480
let's make our explanation

881
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:17,600
a bit visual. Also

882
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:22,680
this C slash user slash is Speaker X

883
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:27,280
is actually a location inside my computer.

884
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:33,600
Do you guys agree with that?

885
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:36,720
Okay. So if this is the location of my Mr.

886
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:40,560
Terminal, can I go to this location

887
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:50,400
manually to my explorer?

888
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:51,240
Okay.

889
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:56,400
So in order to make things more clear
what I'm going to do right now,

890
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:59,880
I'll open up that Explorer
along with that terminal

891
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:03,240
so that we can visualize
booting simultaneously.

892
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:08,040
Okay. Yes.

893
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:10,320
Now, so it does not require Internet.

894
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:16,320
Remember, we are dealing with everything
which is local.

895
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:18,880
Okay. It so

896
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:21,720
I'm going to

897
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:26,480
make my terminal a little bit small

898
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:30,080
and I'm going to minimize everything.

899
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:35,880
And now I want to go to the location
where my Mr.

900
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:39,840
Terminal is
and I want you guys to do the same also.

901
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:42,560
So for me is to be different.

902
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:48,000
And for you
it's also going to be different right?

903
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,440
So the first step is to go to my C,

904
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:54,720
so I'll go to my C

905
01:22:54,720 --> 01:23:00,880
on windows.

906
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:05,560
Let me open them side by side.

907
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:06,000
Okay.

908
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:12,120
So for Mac users, what you have to do,

909
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:21,440
I'll simply tell you, wait for Mac users,

910
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:25,640
you can use this go and from there
you can select wherever

911
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:28,160
your location of

912
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:30,880
terminal is.

913
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:47,360
Okay.

914
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:48,000
Okay, guys.

915
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:53,720
So, Sharif,

916
01:23:54,000 --> 01:24:00,880
what can you find on Mac?

917
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:05,960
And don't worry, I want to
I'll give you time to find that on Mac and

918
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:12,160
man not file which come out is not found.

919
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:15,240
Can you show you a screenshot?

920
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:18,840
Remember, guys, we have to take this class
very slow.

921
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:21,360
We need to take all of our friends
along with us.

922
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:22,200
Some up.

923
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:26,160
Some of you guys might be having a problem
because you know we are not accustomed

924
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:30,040
to terminal and stuff,
so we will take things

925
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:33,040
real slow. Okay

926
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:41,280
so for Windows user, first,
I'm going to explain that

927
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:44,360
and then we can concentrate on Mac users.

928
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:47,200
So if I ask my Mr.

929
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:50,760
Terminal that,
what is your current location,

930
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:55,480
it tells me the location
till this step for Mac and Windows users.

931
01:24:55,480 --> 01:25:07,920
Are we all on the same page?

932
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:10,120
This command is working for everyone,
right? Okay.

933
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:14,840
So for Windows users, what I'll do,

934
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:18,360
let me get to my C drive in the Explorer

935
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:22,560
which is this particular drive C Right.

936
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:26,400
And after that

937
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:31,000
I need to find users in the C drive.

938
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:35,800
So do I see any users in C drive for my
from my computer?

939
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:37,200
I'm talking about my computer.

940
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:41,080
I see that for you
it may be different, maybe same.

941
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:43,800
So I'm going to click on users

942
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:47,880
and after that I want to go to into H

943
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:51,240
because for you guys
it's going to be different.

944
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:54,240
So I'll say this is HP X

945
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:57,800
and I'll click on it.

946
01:25:57,800 --> 01:26:00,400
So if I see that my Mr.

947
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:04,840
Terminal is right now
in this particular location,

948
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:18,000
will I be correct about it or not?

949
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Yes, I'll be correct about it.

950
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:20,640
Okay.

951
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:25,640
So let's whole at this point,
let's try to see to Mac users,

952
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:42,960
what do you have problem with?

953
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:43,600
Okay.

954
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:47,160
So if you are unable to find this
good option,

955
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:51,520
you'll have a option of Finder
in your Mac.

956
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:54,480
Let me show it to you if I can quickly

957
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:56,080
navigate

958
01:26:56,080 --> 01:27:30,880
over there.

959
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:31,400
Okay, guys.

960
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:35,600
So if you have a go, then you can click on

961
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:38,600
Go and click on Home
or maybe go to folder.

962
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:43,760
If you do not have this Google
option available, this means that you have

963
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:49,080
a different version of a mac
or s installed on your Mac.

964
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:53,280
For that we will have to go to Finder.

965
01:27:53,680 --> 01:27:54,160
Right.

966
01:27:54,160 --> 01:28:32,800
So let me show you how to go to Finder.

967
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:34,880
Okay. So ma'am, you are good.

968
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:38,640
You have your finder option available.

969
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:39,520
Okay.

970
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:41,680
So what you can do

971
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:44,560
if you see if you see on your Mac

972
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:48,320
Mac screen, the top right

973
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:52,800
corner,
you'll see a search option over there.

974
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:55,000
If you click on that,

975
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:58,920
you'll be able to find a find
a finder over there.

976
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:13,680
Are you able to do that, Mac users?

977
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:22,920
I'm waiting for you guys.

978
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:23,280
Yeah.

979
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:26,440
I want you all to be good
so that we can proceed together.

980
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:36,560
Okay?

981
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:37,440
Okay. So

982
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:52,400
Mohamed al-Fadhli has shared the solution.

983
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:58,320
If you have the goal, you can simply
go to folder and, you know, type in users.

984
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:01,080
It will tape to users

985
01:30:01,160 --> 01:30:04,800
whatever you type
in, whatever the path you are finding,

986
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:07,080
you can type it over there

987
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:11,160
and Maryam

988
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:14,880
what you need to do.

989
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:18,840
Maryam You have to follow this back.

990
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:23,320
Now whatever is being displayed
by typing in TWD for you,

991
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:27,080
you have to find those folder over here
and navigate into them.

992
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:28,320
Okay?

993
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:36,840
And yes,

994
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:40,200
Michael, you are good to

and you are

996
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:49,280

997
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:51,480

1004

01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:21,360
And let's see.

1014
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:27,000
So those of you who have the Google
available, what you need to do,

1015
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:31,680
you need to simply click on Go

1016
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:34,800
Click on recent folder.

1017
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:35,400

01:37:55,320 --> 01:37:58,200
I'm really sorry,
but I think that I have skipped

1081
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:02,200
the above problems if anyone has having.

1082
01:38:02,200 --> 01:38:06,120
So only the people who are having issues
can you only now

1083
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:08,720
post the

1084
01:38:09,320 --> 01:38:12,080
screenshot because you know,
a lot of students are posting

1085
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:21,480
I can I look into all of them.

1086
01:38:21,480 --> 01:38:23,480
Yes Marina.

1087
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:24,960
Okay.

1088
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:28,440
So what you should be able to look at
when you type in PWT,

1089
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:31,160
you are actually asking Mr.

1090
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:33,280
Trump know that where he is, right?

1091
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:36,560
So Mr. Terminal is in C users.

1092
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:37,800
It speaks for me.

1093
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:40,240
It's going to be different for you, right?

1094
01:38:40,240 --> 01:38:41,520
Makes sense.

1095
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:44,160
I show.

1096
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:46,200
Okay, so it's different for you.

1097
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:49,440
You should be able to locate this folder

1098
01:38:50,640 --> 01:38:53,000
for me, be six for you.

1099
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,000
It's going to be different.

1100
01:38:54,000 --> 01:39:13,680
So are you able to look that
on the system?

1101
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:16,440
No, Michael, nothing else.
We are on break.

1102
01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:20,720
I'm just, you know, helping out
other students are having issues.

1103
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:23,520
We won't be discussing anything.

1104
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:26,600
Yeah, mine user.

1105
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:29,880
And then. Okay, this is your best.

1106
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:32,120
I do understand

1107
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:35,640
you were able to open that to

1108
01:39:35,680 --> 01:39:38,720
to home button, right?

1109
01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:40,560
You were able to do that.

1110
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:43,720
And can you share the screenshot
of both things like your

1111
01:39:44,040 --> 01:39:47,680
your terminal
and the folder that that is zero.

1112
01:39:47,680 --> 01:39:50,160
Can you share the screenshot
if you are able to do that?

1113
01:39:50,160 --> 01:39:54,080
This means that you have successfully
navigated to the location where you are.

1114
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:58,720
Mr. Terminals Okay, so apart from my show,

1115
01:39:58,840 --> 01:40:10,960
who else is still struggling with it?

1116
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:12,960
Okay, so can I? Yeah.

1117
01:40:14,040 --> 01:40:17,640
Can you share the screenshot of your

1118
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:24,080
off your desktop
like the screen that you are seeing?

1119
01:40:24,120 --> 01:40:26,480
I want to see the toolbar that is there.

1120
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:37,800
Do you have the go option available?

1121
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:41,080
Yes, I sure you are. Good.

1122
01:40:41,080 --> 01:40:43,440
It won't let me copy and paste. No, no.

1123
01:40:43,480 --> 01:40:54,600
I don't have an option.

1124
01:40:54,600 --> 01:40:55,280
Okay. Yeah.

1125
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:59,000
So you are saying that you do not have
that Google option

1126
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,760
on the toolbar just like this, right?

1127
01:41:02,360 --> 01:41:03,160
You Do not have this.

1128
01:41:03,160 --> 01:41:05,200
Go right.

1129
01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:06,800
Okay.

1130
01:41:06,840 --> 01:41:09,320
Anyone else who does not have this

1131
01:41:09,320 --> 01:41:20,520
go option?

1132
01:41:20,520 --> 01:41:23,720
Okay, So let me tell you.

1133
01:41:23,720 --> 01:41:33,000
Why is it so?

1134
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:36,720
Can you just name
can you minimize everything

1135
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:43,560
and then then see whether the go option
appears?

1136
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:45,000
Sandy Yes.

1137
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:58,160
You can ask
if you are doing correct or not.

1138
01:41:58,160 --> 01:41:58,960
Okay. I'm Juliet.

1139
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:02,400
Can you share the screenshot
that's is going to help?

1140
01:42:02,840 --> 01:42:03,800
How about me?

1141
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:15,720
If you do that, it's going to be great.

1142
01:42:15,720 --> 01:42:18,360
Okay. Sandy. That's correct.
See users admin.

1143
01:42:18,360 --> 01:43:02,120
So are you able to navigate
to the folder admin successfully?

1144
01:43:02,120 --> 01:43:03,960
Simon Nothing. We are on great.

1145
01:43:05,080 --> 01:43:06,000
Just helping

1146
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:25,200
our students.

1147
01:43:25,200 --> 01:43:25,440
Okay.

1148
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:28,560
Apart from now, is anyone else

1149
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:32,880
having problem?

1150
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:35,720
Okay, can you look a look into that
and help her out?

1151
01:43:36,720 --> 01:43:51,840
Thank you for your support.

1152
01:43:51,840 --> 01:44:26,840
Anyone else who is having issue?

1153
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:27,200
Okay.

1154
01:44:27,200 --> 01:44:31,160
Amelia I guess, Nina,
if you look at what Amelia has shared,

1155
01:44:31,160 --> 01:44:33,720
you will be able to proceed with that

1156
01:44:55,680 --> 01:45:04,640
quick.

1157
01:45:04,640 --> 01:45:07,560
Okay, great. That's great news.

1158
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:08,400
Okay.

1159
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:10,640
I want I want you to do one thing.

1160
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:14,400
I want you to remember what you
how you did that.

1161
01:45:14,440 --> 01:45:21,880
Okay?

1162
01:45:21,880 --> 01:45:23,560
Okay. Perfect.

1163
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:33,960
Anyone left?

1164
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:35,520
Thank you, Amelia.

1165
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:45,960
And thank you guys to you to.

1166
01:45:45,960 --> 01:45:49,360
And trust me, this was the hardest part
we had to go through.

1167
01:45:49,680 --> 01:45:52,680
Rest of the stuff
is pretty much very easy.

1168
01:45:52,680 --> 01:46:12,720
Okay,

1169
01:46:12,720 --> 01:46:54,520
so, yes,

1170
01:46:54,520 --> 01:46:59,360
and I check that your p
w command is showing the correct.

1171
01:46:59,360 --> 01:47:02,280
I asked you to
share the screenshot of your

1172
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:06,840
folder with me so that I can see that
if you have navigated

1173
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:47,280
to the correct location or not.

1174
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:49,440
Okay, I think I skipped it.

1175
01:47:49,440 --> 01:48:07,720
Let, let me go up and try to see that.

1176
01:48:07,720 --> 01:48:12,560
Yes. Yes.

1177
01:48:12,600 --> 01:48:38,800
And then you have done it correctly.

1178
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:39,920
Yes, exactly.

1179
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:42,240
You can do anything and great. Right.

1180
01:48:42,240 --> 01:53:00,280
We still have 5 minutes.

1181
01:53:00,280 --> 01:53:02,960
Okay. So it's 845.

1182
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:12,080
Are you guys back from break?

1183
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:13,960
Oh, that's that's good.

1184
01:53:13,960 --> 01:53:14,880
Okay. Welcome back.

1185
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:21,600
I hope you had your coffee, snacks,
whatever you wanted.

1186
01:53:21,600 --> 01:53:28,400
Okay, great.

1187
01:53:28,400 --> 01:53:33,400
Yes. And Mac is a little bit complicated,
but you will be okay with it.

1188
01:53:33,400 --> 01:53:36,120
You just need to,
you know, get accustomed to it.

1189
01:53:36,840 --> 01:53:38,320
You will be okay.

1190
01:53:38,320 --> 01:53:38,880
Okay.

1191
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:41,280
So let's let me give you a quick recap

1192
01:53:41,280 --> 01:53:44,280
of what we were doing,
and then let's start doing that By now.

1193
01:53:44,280 --> 01:53:50,760
I hope that all of you are at least able
to find the folders right?

1194
01:53:50,760 --> 01:53:51,120
Okay.

1195
01:53:51,120 --> 01:53:56,480
So the first step we did is that
we asked our terminal that who am I?

1196
01:53:56,640 --> 01:53:59,560
It told us the name.

1197
01:53:59,560 --> 01:54:01,600
Then I asked that. Okay.

1198
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:05,760
TWD Can you tell me your current location?

1199
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:10,000
Mr. Terminal
It gives me that C user, ABC X,

1200
01:54:10,040 --> 01:54:12,680
which is my location,
is going to be different for you.

1201
01:54:13,560 --> 01:54:17,520
So then we decided that we want to look,

1202
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:21,120
have a look at location on our computer.

1203
01:54:21,440 --> 01:54:26,520
And for that purpose I went to the C drive

1204
01:54:31,680 --> 01:54:33,920
and there I look for users

1205
01:54:35,560 --> 01:54:39,560
and then I'll look for HBC X
and I clicked on it

1206
01:54:40,320 --> 01:54:44,480
and now I see that my terminal
is currently

1207
01:54:44,480 --> 01:54:48,720
in this particular location.

1208
01:54:48,720 --> 01:54:53,320
So are you guys able to find the location
of your terminal

1209
01:54:53,320 --> 01:55:00,720
in your computer?

1210
01:55:00,720 --> 01:55:02,640
Okay, perfect.

1211
01:55:02,640 --> 01:55:06,240
So now let me give you
some details about this.

1212
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:09,680
So this slash is actually

1213
01:55:10,760 --> 01:55:15,160
determining the next directory of folder.

1214
01:55:15,160 --> 01:55:19,480
So the first folder is C,
And to differentiate

1215
01:55:19,480 --> 01:55:21,680
between this and

1216
01:55:23,280 --> 01:55:27,640
this folder, we have a slash
and to tell us that

1217
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:30,920
now the next folder is starting,
we have an agenda

1218
01:55:30,920 --> 01:55:34,080
slash and folder name

1219
01:55:34,080 --> 01:55:37,440
does it make sense?

1220
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:41,520
These flashes.

1221
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:45,880
Okay, so now the interesting thing is that
if you look at this pad

1222
01:55:46,440 --> 01:55:51,560
and on windows, if you look at this bat
over here and you click on it,

1223
01:55:52,200 --> 01:55:55,720
C users, HBC X and C users

1224
01:55:55,720 --> 01:56:03,240
is it's going to be the same.

1225
01:56:03,240 --> 01:56:09,720
Is it same for you guys?

1226
01:56:09,720 --> 01:56:10,000
Okay.

1227
01:56:11,640 --> 01:56:13,440
So does this mean that we

1228
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:18,480
have navigated to the right location?

1229
01:56:18,480 --> 01:56:20,120
Yes. Okay.

1230
01:56:20,120 --> 01:56:23,000
So now I want

1231
01:56:23,760 --> 01:56:27,000
why are the slash is different

1232
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,640
there over here backslash.

1233
01:56:29,640 --> 01:56:30,040
Okay.

1234
01:56:30,040 --> 01:56:31,720
That doesn't make any difference.

1235
01:56:31,720 --> 01:56:34,200
Okay. It can be forward or backward.

1236
01:56:34,200 --> 01:56:37,760
I'll explain it to you further in
the course that what difference it makes.

1237
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:40,160
For now, let's assume that they are saying

1238
01:56:41,880 --> 01:56:46,360
yes for hot.

1239
01:56:46,360 --> 01:56:47,080
Okay,

1240
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:52,840
So now whenever we close our terminal

1241
01:56:52,840 --> 01:56:56,960
and we write down TWD,

1242
01:56:56,960 --> 01:57:16,680
is this location always the same?

1243
01:57:16,680 --> 01:57:17,320
Okay,

1244
01:57:18,280 --> 01:57:21,040
so whenever you close your terminal,

1245
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:25,080
remember
close your terminal and open it up again.

1246
01:57:26,480 --> 01:57:29,280
This location is going to remain the same.

1247
01:57:29,760 --> 01:57:30,960
Let me show you.

1248
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:33,760
I'm going to close my terminal

1249
01:57:33,760 --> 01:57:44,640
and I'm going to open it up again.

1250
01:57:44,640 --> 01:57:46,800
So now I'll type again.

1251
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:49,320
What's the command

1252
01:57:50,040 --> 01:57:50,400
to know?

1253
01:57:50,400 --> 01:57:54,280
The current location
of the Metro terminal? TWD

1254
01:57:55,800 --> 01:57:58,480
It is same.

1255
01:57:58,480 --> 01:58:01,440
So every time
if I close and open my terminal

1256
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:06,200
and the very first thing I do, I do TWD,
this is going to be the same.

1257
01:58:06,200 --> 01:58:12,280
So again, I see that this particular
location is the home of my Mr.

1258
01:58:12,280 --> 01:58:17,880
Terminal, and I see that.

1259
01:58:17,880 --> 01:58:19,000
Okay.

1260
01:58:19,320 --> 01:58:22,600
So I can also say

1261
01:58:22,600 --> 01:58:26,440
that this location is my home directory

1262
01:58:26,440 --> 01:58:35,640
or home folder.

1263
01:58:35,640 --> 01:58:35,920
Okay.

1264
01:58:35,920 --> 01:58:39,160
So now whenever I say
navigate to your home

1265
01:58:39,160 --> 01:58:42,760
directory,
will you guys be able to understand that?

1266
01:58:42,760 --> 01:58:47,920
What am I referring to?

1267
01:58:47,920 --> 01:58:52,000
I am referring to the very first location.

1268
01:58:52,600 --> 01:58:57,120
When you open up your terminal,
the terminal is over there.

1269
01:58:57,120 --> 01:58:59,120
I'm referring to that particular location.

1270
01:58:59,120 --> 01:59:02,880
Okay, So this was just to let you know
that in future

1271
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:06,240
we will be using the terminal home
directory

1272
01:59:06,680 --> 01:59:09,280
so that you can understand that.

1273
01:59:09,320 --> 01:59:10,920
What I mean by home directly.

1274
01:59:10,920 --> 01:59:13,000
Okay, good enough.

1275
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:16,800
Now, at this point, if I want to ask Mr.

1276
01:59:16,800 --> 01:59:20,720
Terminal
to give me all the file and folder

1277
01:59:20,720 --> 01:59:26,440
it has in the current location,
which command can I use

1278
01:59:28,200 --> 01:59:28,920
else.

1279
01:59:28,920 --> 01:59:29,640
Right.

1280
01:59:30,600 --> 01:59:34,560
And if I press, enter, it shows me

1281
01:59:37,160 --> 01:59:39,120
these files and folders.

1282
01:59:39,120 --> 01:59:43,240
Now I'm going to compare
just to be assured

1283
01:59:43,640 --> 01:59:47,920
that this command is actually up to go.

1284
01:59:47,920 --> 01:59:49,440
I can create or not.

1285
01:59:49,440 --> 01:59:52,120
So let's start that. Okay.

1286
01:59:52,120 --> 01:59:55,360
I have my downloads, I have my downloads.

1287
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,600
I have my documents. I have my documents.

1288
01:59:58,920 --> 02:00:00,120
I have my desktop.

1289
02:00:00,120 --> 02:00:04,120
I have my desktop creative cloud creative
that so so

1290
02:00:04,880 --> 02:00:08,360
it's actually giving me everything
that it has

1291
02:00:08,760 --> 02:00:13,600
and its current location.

1292
02:00:13,600 --> 02:00:14,680
Okay,

1293
02:00:15,920 --> 02:00:21,400
so now
it's time to learn the next command.

1294
02:00:21,400 --> 02:00:26,120
No, for it does not show it in folders.

1295
02:00:26,120 --> 02:00:26,760
Okay.

1296
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:29,200
So now what if you want to ask

1297
02:00:31,480 --> 02:00:33,600
Mr. Terminal

1298
02:00:33,600 --> 02:00:52,680
to move into, we want to ask Mr.

1299
02:00:52,680 --> 02:01:01,480
Terminal to move into another location
from its current one.

1300
02:01:01,480 --> 02:01:05,520
So basically,
if I simplify it, we are asking Mr.

1301
02:01:05,520 --> 02:01:16,440
Terminal to change the folder right.

1302
02:01:16,440 --> 02:01:17,320
Okay.

1303
02:01:17,320 --> 02:01:20,600
For this purpose we have a command CB

1304
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,240
folder name.

1305
02:01:24,240 --> 02:01:27,080
CTE stands for

1306
02:01:27,360 --> 02:01:30,720
Change Directory
and you guys remember that?

1307
02:01:30,720 --> 02:01:46,160
I told you
I can refer to folder as directory.

1308
02:01:46,160 --> 02:01:47,040
Okay,

1309
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:51,720
so now let's do one thing.

1310
02:01:51,720 --> 02:01:52,920
Let's take on Mr.

1311
02:01:52,920 --> 02:01:56,400
Terminal from its home directory

1312
02:01:57,000 --> 02:02:01,080
to this desktop.

1313
02:02:01,080 --> 02:02:15,600
So what am I supposed to type in
in the terminal.

1314
02:02:15,600 --> 02:02:17,040
Okay, I type in CD.

1315
02:02:17,040 --> 02:02:21,920
Is that it?

1316
02:02:21,920 --> 02:02:25,120
C d and then the folder name to

1317
02:02:25,120 --> 02:02:27,720
which we want it to move.

1318
02:02:28,520 --> 02:02:31,800
So I'm going to type C, D, desktop

1319
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:46,440
and then I'll press enter.

1320
02:02:46,440 --> 02:02:47,400
Okay.

1321
02:02:48,240 --> 02:02:49,720
So now

1322
02:02:50,360 --> 02:02:52,960
this command did not give us any output,

1323
02:02:53,760 --> 02:02:56,720
but I want to know that further

1324
02:02:57,160 --> 02:03:01,640
my terminal has actually changed
is its folder or not.

1325
02:03:02,120 --> 02:03:04,760
So for that purpose, which command

1326
02:03:04,760 --> 02:03:09,520
can I use?

1327
02:03:09,520 --> 02:03:10,920
I can ask Terminal that.

1328
02:03:10,920 --> 02:03:12,840
Hey, can you tell
me your current location?

1329
02:03:13,840 --> 02:03:17,160
So for that I'll use p WD.

1330
02:03:18,120 --> 02:03:18,360
Okay.

1331
02:03:18,360 --> 02:03:23,160
So now it sees that I am in C users SBC

1332
02:03:23,480 --> 02:03:31,680
and then desktop.

1333
02:03:31,680 --> 02:03:43,280
So this means that RCD desktop
has successfully executed.

1334
02:03:43,280 --> 02:03:44,360
Okay.

1335
02:03:44,440 --> 02:03:48,960
Now let's also do this on our Explorer.

1336
02:03:48,960 --> 02:03:55,600
I want to go to the full under
where my terminal is right now.

1337
02:03:56,280 --> 02:04:07,480
So what I'll do over here,

1338
02:04:07,480 --> 02:04:12,760
I simply click on desktop and right now

1339
02:04:12,760 --> 02:04:21,560
my terminal is in this location.

1340
02:04:21,560 --> 02:04:22,400
Okay.

1341
02:04:23,080 --> 02:04:26,400
So now I want to

1342
02:04:26,400 --> 02:04:29,640
ask Terminal to print all the files

1343
02:04:29,920 --> 02:04:32,440
it has in desktop.

1344
02:04:33,360 --> 02:04:42,720
What will I do for that?

1345
02:04:42,720 --> 02:04:45,000
I'll say again. LS

1346
02:05:01,080 --> 02:05:03,200
okay, so

1347
02:05:03,200 --> 02:05:06,200
all the files
that are there in the desktop,

1348
02:05:06,800 --> 02:05:13,080
they are being displayed over here.

1349
02:05:13,080 --> 02:05:13,480
Yeah.

1350
02:05:13,480 --> 02:05:16,640
My Mac has some permissions issue.

1351
02:05:18,120 --> 02:05:19,080
Yeah. Jimmy, don't worry.

1352
02:05:19,080 --> 02:05:22,680
We will be going over to it
multiple times.

1353
02:05:22,680 --> 02:05:28,200
Okay.

1354
02:05:28,200 --> 02:05:29,640
Okay. So right now what we did,

1355
02:05:30,760 --> 02:05:32,800
we navigated into

1356
02:05:32,840 --> 02:05:36,560
desktop using see desktop and then

1357
02:05:38,760 --> 02:05:40,360
over here

1358
02:05:40,480 --> 02:05:42,760
what we said that

1359
02:05:43,480 --> 02:05:45,040
ls to print

1360
02:05:45,040 --> 02:05:47,280
all the files that it has on desktop.

1361
02:05:48,840 --> 02:05:53,520
Okay,
so not all of you are able to do that.

1362
02:05:53,520 --> 02:05:57,600
Some of you are having the problem
that no such

1363
02:05:57,600 --> 02:06:00,600
file are directory.

1364
02:06:00,600 --> 02:06:02,520
Okay, so what I want

1365
02:06:02,520 --> 02:06:05,200
you to do is make sure of one thing.

1366
02:06:05,680 --> 02:06:06,960
Okay? See?

1367
02:06:07,040 --> 02:06:10,600
Okay.

1368
02:06:10,600 --> 02:06:12,960
Make sure of one thing

1369
02:06:12,960 --> 02:06:15,200
that when you did ls

1370
02:06:15,960 --> 02:06:19,760
in your previous previous step,

1371
02:06:20,400 --> 02:06:23,680
your desktop was being displayed in

1372
02:06:23,680 --> 02:06:27,480
that command is in there or not

1373
02:06:28,200 --> 02:06:29,520
like it's showing for me.

1374
02:06:29,520 --> 02:06:44,560
Is it showing for you to.

1375
02:06:44,560 --> 02:06:46,840
Okay my for those of you

1376
02:06:47,680 --> 02:06:52,080
who are unable to see desktop,
Allen said that.

1377
02:06:52,200 --> 02:06:56,360
But those of you
who are able to see the desktop guys,

1378
02:06:56,960 --> 02:06:59,880
you must be having some problem
with the syntax.

1379
02:07:00,360 --> 02:07:00,760
Okay.

1380
02:07:02,120 --> 02:07:03,040
For those of you who

1381
02:07:03,040 --> 02:07:07,040
cannot see desktop in that, it's
can you tell me that?

1382
02:07:07,040 --> 02:07:10,800
Why it gives you an error of that.

1383
02:07:10,800 --> 02:07:22,400
No such file or directory?

1384
02:07:22,400 --> 02:07:24,640
Because let me explain it to you

1385
02:07:26,040 --> 02:07:28,280
because right now

1386
02:07:29,040 --> 02:07:30,200
what you are doing

1387
02:07:30,200 --> 02:07:32,960
is that you are inside this folder

1388
02:07:44,240 --> 02:07:44,920
right now.

1389
02:07:44,920 --> 02:07:45,480
Your Mr.

1390
02:07:45,480 --> 02:07:48,560
Terminal is at this point and it has,

1391
02:07:48,560 --> 02:07:51,320
let's say, one two folder, E

1392
02:07:51,840 --> 02:07:54,400
and B and four in front of it.

1393
02:07:54,400 --> 02:07:58,080
And there is a seafood
which is not in that location.

1394
02:07:58,080 --> 02:07:59,280
You are asking Mr.

1395
02:07:59,280 --> 02:08:03,200
Terminal that he can you go to C but Mr.

1396
02:08:03,200 --> 02:08:07,200
Terminal only has A and B in front of him
so that's

1397
02:08:07,200 --> 02:08:15,120
why he's unable to go there.

1398
02:08:15,120 --> 02:08:16,560
Makes sense.

1399
02:08:17,280 --> 02:08:42,520
So what you will do, I'll tell you.

1400
02:08:42,520 --> 02:08:46,080
Okay, Sandy, for you,
you have already successfully

1401
02:08:47,680 --> 02:08:49,440
navigated to desktop, okay?

1402
02:08:49,440 --> 02:08:52,360
So you don't need to worry about that and

1403
02:08:52,640 --> 02:08:58,800
do for you R2.

1404
02:08:58,840 --> 02:09:02,440
You have also successfully
navigated to desktop

1405
02:09:07,520 --> 02:09:12,240
and now while you have also navigated
to desktop

1406
02:09:13,400 --> 02:09:22,440
successfully successfully.

1407
02:09:22,440 --> 02:09:26,720
Okay, so for those of you
who do not have a desktop

1408
02:09:27,040 --> 02:09:30,360
in the class,
you won't be able to navigate to that.

1409
02:09:30,360 --> 02:09:35,960
What you can do, you can pick
any of the folder that is being displayed

1410
02:09:35,960 --> 02:09:39,800
and you can use see the
that particular folder name

1411
02:09:39,800 --> 02:09:47,360
to navigate into that.

1412
02:09:47,360 --> 02:09:49,280
I'm going to repeat it. Okay.

1413
02:09:49,280 --> 02:09:53,280
So for those of you
who do not have desktop,

1414
02:09:53,280 --> 02:09:56,640
you can simply pick one of the

1415
02:09:57,920 --> 02:10:00,760
one of the items that is displayed.

1416
02:10:00,760 --> 02:10:04,200
It can be documents or downloads
and you can simply write CD

1417
02:10:05,120 --> 02:10:06,440
instead of desktop.

1418
02:10:06,440 --> 02:10:10,240
You can write
down downloads are a document

1419
02:10:15,960 --> 02:10:18,520
or you are a good

1420
02:10:20,760 --> 02:10:21,600
okay.

1421
02:10:22,240 --> 02:10:25,680
After that you can do lists
and see the files and folders

1422
02:10:25,680 --> 02:10:33,680
that are being displayed at that point.

1423
02:10:33,680 --> 02:10:36,800
Farhad How do you know
which is the folder you can use?

1424
02:10:36,800 --> 02:10:37,320
The command?

1425
02:10:37,320 --> 02:10:40,800
LS It will display
you all the files and folders

1426
02:10:40,800 --> 02:10:49,840
to which you can navigate.

1427
02:10:49,840 --> 02:10:52,400
Okay guys. So are we good till this?

1428
02:10:53,560 --> 02:11:10,320
I perfect.

1429
02:11:10,320 --> 02:11:15,080
So now we moved into another directory
or folder.

1430
02:11:15,080 --> 02:11:19,680
We learn that what is the command
that can be used for that?

1431
02:11:19,680 --> 02:11:24,360
Now let's learn the last command.

1432
02:11:24,360 --> 02:11:26,640
That's fine now
so you can move to different one.

1433
02:11:26,720 --> 02:11:28,200
That's fine.

1434
02:11:28,800 --> 02:11:31,720
Okay, so the next one is

1435
02:11:33,240 --> 02:11:33,560
what?

1436
02:11:33,560 --> 02:11:35,320
If you want to say that here, Mr.

1437
02:11:35,320 --> 02:11:36,640
Terminal,

1438
02:11:37,440 --> 02:11:39,960
can you move

1439
02:11:39,960 --> 02:11:50,400
once folder back?

1440
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:54,480
So for that we have a command
which is C this space

1441
02:11:55,120 --> 02:12:07,480
dot, dot.

1442
02:12:07,480 --> 02:12:08,000
Okay,

1443
02:12:09,480 --> 02:12:11,600
so let's try that out

1444
02:12:13,080 --> 02:12:14,440
right now.

1445
02:12:14,440 --> 02:12:17,680
If I want to check my current location
of Mr.

1446
02:12:17,680 --> 02:12:19,880
Terminal, what is the command

1447
02:12:28,160 --> 02:12:29,240
that again,

1448
02:12:29,240 --> 02:12:32,040
I want to check the current location
of my Mr.

1449
02:12:32,040 --> 02:12:33,000
Terminal.

1450
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:36,520
It's TWD cousin and Abdul

1451
02:12:37,560 --> 02:12:39,600
current location.

1452
02:12:39,920 --> 02:12:45,200
So it is inside desktop right now.

1453
02:12:45,320 --> 02:12:49,080
I want it to move one folder back.

1454
02:12:50,120 --> 02:12:53,360
What should I type in?

1455
02:12:53,360 --> 02:12:57,440
I should type in city space, dot, dot.

1456
02:12:57,600 --> 02:13:01,560
Right.

1457
02:13:01,560 --> 02:13:03,520
And then I'll press enter.

1458
02:13:03,520 --> 02:13:06,240
Okay.

1459
02:13:06,240 --> 02:13:10,080
Now I want to make sure that terminal
has moved

1460
02:13:10,080 --> 02:13:15,160
one step back.

1461
02:13:15,160 --> 02:13:17,880
And I want to ask that
what is your current location

1462
02:13:19,440 --> 02:13:20,040
again?

1463
02:13:20,040 --> 02:13:26,200
I'll do TWD right.

1464
02:13:26,200 --> 02:13:30,280
So now I'm sure that my city, dot, dot
actually

1465
02:13:30,280 --> 02:13:45,320
works right.

1466
02:13:45,320 --> 02:13:48,720
CD space dot com

1467
02:13:48,720 --> 02:13:53,520
might see this based on the.

1468
02:13:53,520 --> 02:13:53,960
Okay,

1469
02:13:55,720 --> 02:14:00,080
so let me just close everything

1470
02:14:01,920 --> 02:14:05,760
and let me just open up my nodes
and ask you that

1471
02:14:06,920 --> 02:14:10,160
we have learned up to this point
full commands

1472
02:14:10,560 --> 02:14:15,720
which are pwt ls

1473
02:14:17,880 --> 02:14:20,000
CB, dot, dot.

1474
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:47,640
Okay, I'm going to write them down
in small letters.

1475
02:14:47,640 --> 02:14:48,040
Okay.

1476
02:14:48,040 --> 02:14:51,800
So for PWT, what does PWT do

1477
02:14:51,800 --> 02:15:14,760
guys?

1478
02:15:14,760 --> 02:15:16,800
Okay, what does LS do

1479
02:15:36,240 --> 02:15:39,560
and what's the purpose of CB folder?

1480
02:15:39,560 --> 02:15:56,760
The name.

1481
02:15:56,760 --> 02:16:04,760
Okay, so what will happen
if your feed folder name

1482
02:16:04,760 --> 02:16:09,160
The folder name you are giving
is not present in front of Mr.

1483
02:16:09,160 --> 02:16:09,720
Terminal.

1484
02:16:09,720 --> 02:16:32,120
What will happen?

1485
02:16:32,120 --> 02:16:37,120
It will say no such file or directory

1486
02:16:39,200 --> 02:16:41,760
right? No.

1487
02:16:41,760 --> 02:16:44,480
It will give you the URL that

1488
02:16:44,480 --> 02:16:48,720
no such file or directory.

1489
02:16:48,720 --> 02:16:50,520
So city Dada.

1490
02:16:50,520 --> 02:17:02,160
What does this command do?

1491
02:17:02,160 --> 02:17:08,200
Go back one folder.

1492
02:17:08,200 --> 02:17:08,480
That's

1493
02:17:12,720 --> 02:17:13,680
okay.

1494
02:17:13,760 --> 02:17:15,360
So now let's do this.

1495
02:17:15,360 --> 02:17:19,320
I want you guys to stop
everything that you are doing.

1496
02:17:20,320 --> 02:17:23,560
Take a break from your computer
and your terminals

1497
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,600
and you guys are going to do now

1498
02:17:26,680 --> 02:17:30,240
help me on my computer to do the stuff.

1499
02:17:30,240 --> 02:17:37,480
Okay?

1500
02:17:37,480 --> 02:17:37,760
Yeah.

1501
02:17:37,760 --> 02:17:41,440
For not giving you a little break.

1502
02:17:41,440 --> 02:17:42,400
Yeah. I need I.T.

1503
02:17:42,400 --> 02:17:45,320
support. Okay, guys.

1504
02:17:45,320 --> 02:17:52,160
So I tell you the task that I want to do.

1505
02:17:52,160 --> 02:17:58,000
So what I want to do is I want to,
first of all, find

1506
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:07,440
that where my terminal is is.

1507
02:18:07,440 --> 02:18:09,800
What? What do I do?

1508
02:18:09,840 --> 02:18:14,080
PWT So,

1509
02:18:14,080 --> 02:18:17,000
yes, spotlight, search the terminal.

1510
02:18:17,840 --> 02:18:19,200
I'm on Windows. Okay.

1511
02:18:19,200 --> 02:18:21,840
So the first step is to open up
my get bash, Right.

1512
02:18:22,360 --> 02:18:26,160
So I'll open it up.

1513
02:18:26,160 --> 02:18:26,960
Okay.

1514
02:18:27,240 --> 02:18:29,840
And now I'll type WD

1515
02:18:29,920 --> 02:18:35,200
right.

1516
02:18:35,200 --> 02:18:36,040
Okay.

1517
02:18:36,240 --> 02:18:38,520
So it is showing me the location.

1518
02:18:39,160 --> 02:18:42,200
Now I want you guys to tell me,
what do we call

1519
02:18:42,200 --> 02:18:52,200
this location.

1520
02:18:52,200 --> 02:18:52,400
Okay,

1521
02:18:53,400 --> 02:18:54,360
exactly.

1522
02:18:54,360 --> 02:18:57,120
We call it home directory. Why?

1523
02:18:57,360 --> 02:18:58,760
Because every time you close

1524
02:18:58,760 --> 02:19:02,600
the terminal, when we open it
up, a terminal is sitting over there.

1525
02:19:03,120 --> 02:19:03,880
Okay,

1526
02:19:04,560 --> 02:19:07,960
so now

1527
02:19:07,960 --> 02:19:10,560
I want to see

1528
02:19:11,400 --> 02:19:14,320
which folders are present

1529
02:19:14,320 --> 02:19:19,320
in the current location.

1530
02:19:19,320 --> 02:19:21,920
I'll do ls right.

1531
02:19:21,920 --> 02:19:27,240
It will list every folder
that I have inside.

1532
02:19:27,240 --> 02:19:30,440
Okay. Very good.

1533
02:19:30,440 --> 02:19:35,920
Now I need to change the location
of my terminal

1534
02:19:37,040 --> 02:19:40,560
to let's see

1535
02:19:40,560 --> 02:19:44,280
the folder. ABC.

1536
02:19:44,280 --> 02:19:45,880
So what I will do?

1537
02:19:45,880 --> 02:19:47,280
See the ABC.

1538
02:19:47,280 --> 02:19:51,840
So let's do see the ABC.

1539
02:19:51,840 --> 02:19:55,160
It shows me no such file or directory.

1540
02:19:56,400 --> 02:20:01,680
Why is that so?

1541
02:20:01,680 --> 02:20:04,200
Because in the current location

1542
02:20:05,960 --> 02:20:11,080
terminal doesn't see any see right.

1543
02:20:11,080 --> 02:20:11,720
Okay.

1544
02:20:11,720 --> 02:20:15,320
So this means that terminal
can only go to the files

1545
02:20:15,320 --> 02:20:18,920
and folder
which are there in the current location.

1546
02:20:18,920 --> 02:20:19,680
Right.

1547
02:20:20,160 --> 02:20:24,760
So let's see, I want to go to documents.

1548
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:29,840
So what will I do?

1549
02:20:29,840 --> 02:20:33,360
So I do see the documents right

1550
02:20:38,200 --> 02:20:41,880
now to make sure that terminal is actually

1551
02:20:42,040 --> 02:20:46,960
in documents. TWD

1552
02:20:49,680 --> 02:20:52,440
Now to print the contents

1553
02:20:53,040 --> 02:20:58,240
of the location, document.

1554
02:20:58,240 --> 02:21:04,520
LS Right.

1555
02:21:04,520 --> 02:21:08,280
Now, if I want to go to

1556
02:21:08,280 --> 02:21:10,080
let's see

1557
02:21:17,120 --> 02:21:21,920
to have a folder in there.

1558
02:21:21,920 --> 02:21:26,280
Yeah, I want to move one step back.

1559
02:21:26,280 --> 02:21:30,520
What will I do?

1560
02:21:30,520 --> 02:21:32,840
C d dot, dot. Right.

1561
02:21:34,200 --> 02:21:35,200
Okay,

1562
02:21:35,840 --> 02:21:46,560
now again, I want to move to desktop.

1563
02:21:46,560 --> 02:21:47,920
I'll come to that.

1564
02:21:47,920 --> 02:21:50,520
So I'll say c d desktop

1565
02:21:50,520 --> 02:21:55,200
right.

1566
02:21:55,200 --> 02:21:55,920
Okay.

1567
02:21:55,920 --> 02:22:03,160
So now let's view
the content of desktop LS.

1568
02:22:03,880 --> 02:22:07,640
Now let's go into the folder, get

1569
02:22:17,280 --> 02:22:18,200
now let's view

1570
02:22:18,200 --> 02:22:20,320
the content of the folder, get

1571
02:22:29,520 --> 02:22:30,680
okay, perfect.

1572
02:22:30,680 --> 02:22:36,000
Now let's make sure that
what is the current location of our Mr.

1573
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:40,120
Terminal?

1574
02:22:40,120 --> 02:22:40,960
It's inside.

1575
02:22:40,960 --> 02:22:42,240
Get now.

1576
02:22:42,240 --> 02:22:49,720
I want my terminal to move one step back.

1577
02:22:49,720 --> 02:22:57,160
I want to make sure it has moved
one step back.

1578
02:22:57,160 --> 02:23:05,800
I want to move one step back again.

1579
02:23:05,800 --> 02:23:12,040
I want to make sure it has moved
one step back.

1580
02:23:12,040 --> 02:23:13,560
Okay, great.

1581
02:23:13,560 --> 02:23:15,000
Okay, great. Perfect.

1582
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,480
Perfect, guys.
Really impressive. Really impressive.

1583
02:23:17,480 --> 02:23:20,400
You guys did an awesome job.

1584
02:23:20,400 --> 02:23:22,680
Yeah, I can already see that.

1585
02:23:22,680 --> 02:23:25,760
Perfect. Sure.

1586
02:23:27,200 --> 02:23:28,920
Yes. Michael, I have a great student.

1587
02:23:28,920 --> 02:23:29,960
Okay, perfect.

1588
02:23:29,960 --> 02:23:35,280
So now tell me, guys,
do you understand how we can navigate

1589
02:23:35,280 --> 02:23:38,840
in between folders using these commands?

1590
02:23:39,360 --> 02:23:44,680
Is it difficult?

1591
02:23:44,680 --> 02:23:45,480
Right. It's.

1592
02:23:45,480 --> 02:23:52,800
It's so simple.

1593
02:23:52,800 --> 02:23:55,120
Pretty straightforward. You. Right.

1594
02:23:55,120 --> 02:23:57,480
Okay, so now let's do one

1595
02:23:57,480 --> 02:24:08,200
task together.

1596
02:24:08,200 --> 02:24:10,400
Well, let's clear everything

1597
02:24:12,080 --> 02:24:13,680
and let's close our terminal.

1598
02:24:13,680 --> 02:24:15,680
Let's do it from the very scratch.

1599
02:24:15,680 --> 02:24:27,640
Okay?

1600
02:24:27,640 --> 02:24:27,920
Okay.

1601
02:24:27,920 --> 02:24:34,680
So the first step, what I want to do,
I want to open up my gimp bash for Mac.

1602
02:24:34,680 --> 02:24:37,640
Obviously,
you guys are going to open up your

1603
02:24:39,920 --> 02:25:01,400
terminals.

1604
02:25:01,400 --> 02:25:04,760
Let's now do pwt to see that

1605
02:25:05,640 --> 02:25:08,440
the current location is HBC X.

1606
02:25:09,360 --> 02:25:16,680
For me, it's
going to be different for you.

1607
02:25:16,680 --> 02:25:18,920
Okay. Are we all good until this point?

1608
02:25:19,680 --> 02:25:22,440
Are we?
Have you all done that? Okay, done.

1609
02:25:22,520 --> 02:25:28,360
Perfect Now let's open up
this location in our Explorer.

1610
02:25:28,520 --> 02:25:33,480
So for me, I'll go to this
PC, I'll click on see Drive

1611
02:25:36,480 --> 02:25:38,000
and then I'll go to

1612
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:42,680
the users and then I'll go to HPC X.

1613
02:25:42,720 --> 02:25:45,320
So this is my current location for you.

1614
02:25:45,320 --> 02:25:46,920
It's going to be different.

1615
02:25:46,920 --> 02:25:52,440
Let me know once all of you have navigated
successfully to the current location,

1616
02:25:52,720 --> 02:26:03,240
which is home directory off your terminal.

1617
02:26:03,240 --> 02:26:05,080
Okay, perfect.

1618
02:26:05,080 --> 02:26:08,760
Very good.

1619
02:26:08,760 --> 02:26:12,720
Now I want to view
the content of this folder.

1620
02:26:13,680 --> 02:26:15,280
So what I'll do

1621
02:26:18,880 --> 02:26:20,560
is I'll do

1622
02:26:20,560 --> 02:26:25,040
ls right.

1623
02:26:25,040 --> 02:26:28,200
Okay. Till this point,

1624
02:26:28,200 --> 02:26:31,200
I hope that none of you
is going to be having any problems

1625
02:26:31,200 --> 02:26:34,720
and we all will be on the same page.

1626
02:26:34,720 --> 02:26:38,280
Let me know if you guys are done
with this point and then let's move

1627
02:26:38,280 --> 02:26:44,720
forward.

1628
02:26:44,720 --> 02:26:45,920
Very good.

1629
02:26:46,680 --> 02:26:50,040
Okay, so now for me,

1630
02:26:50,040 --> 02:26:54,040
I have desktop, so I'll go to desktop.

1631
02:26:55,120 --> 02:26:57,360
For those of you who do not have desktop,

1632
02:26:57,600 --> 02:27:03,480
you can navigate to document or download
or any any other folder that you see.

1633
02:27:04,080 --> 02:27:07,200
So I'll use the command, see the desktop

1634
02:27:09,080 --> 02:27:11,760
and I'll press, enter

1635
02:27:12,960 --> 02:27:13,960
Okay, Over here

1636
02:27:13,960 --> 02:27:20,040
also I'll open up my desktop.

1637
02:27:20,040 --> 02:27:22,160
Now let me just

1638
02:27:23,240 --> 02:27:25,400
create a new folder

1639
02:27:28,640 --> 02:27:31,240
inside my desktop on the Explorer

1640
02:27:32,280 --> 02:27:34,440
and let's name it Bad

1641
02:27:34,520 --> 02:27:42,240
Lemon is smart.

1642
02:27:42,240 --> 02:27:47,320
So on Windows you just right click
and you can create new and folder

1643
02:27:47,320 --> 02:27:52,880
and on Mac also you will be following
the same steps You can simply click on

1644
02:27:53,600 --> 02:27:56,600
right click on your space and know

1645
02:27:56,720 --> 02:28:02,520
create a new folder.

1646
02:28:02,520 --> 02:28:05,440
So now if I'm terminal, I do ls

1647
02:28:06,480 --> 02:28:10,120
What will happen?

1648
02:28:10,120 --> 02:28:19,000
Okay, so when we are not learning that
right now, now what I do ls At this point

1649
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:22,560
I can see that batch 11 is smart
is appearing

1650
02:28:23,200 --> 02:28:26,240
right. Okay.

1651
02:28:26,240 --> 02:28:29,480
I want to move my Mr. Terminal inside.

1652
02:28:29,480 --> 02:28:30,840
Batch 11 is smart.

1653
02:28:30,840 --> 02:28:49,200
What I'll do.

1654
02:28:49,200 --> 02:28:53,080
Okay,
so in the Explorer, I'll just click on it.

1655
02:28:54,480 --> 02:28:54,960
Okay?

1656
02:28:54,960 --> 02:29:08,120
And This point, if I do ls
what's going to be the output?

1657
02:29:08,120 --> 02:29:08,640
Nothing.

1658
02:29:08,640 --> 02:29:10,320
Because I have nothing in there.

1659
02:29:10,320 --> 02:29:13,400
Right.

1660
02:29:13,400 --> 02:29:16,440
But what if I create a new folder

1661
02:29:17,720 --> 02:29:21,000
saying that ABCD

1662
02:29:23,040 --> 02:29:24,480
and now if I do ls,

1663
02:29:24,480 --> 02:29:28,680
what will happen?

1664
02:29:28,680 --> 02:29:34,520
Yes, because you have to type full name.

1665
02:29:34,520 --> 02:29:36,440
So I'll do

1666
02:29:39,480 --> 02:29:40,080
what?

1667
02:29:40,080 --> 02:29:44,800
Only A, B, c, D,
what will be the command does?

1668
02:29:44,800 --> 02:29:51,320
I want you to remember the command.

1669
02:29:51,320 --> 02:29:53,160
Okay. Let me repeat the question.

1670
02:29:53,160 --> 02:29:55,200
I want to

1671
02:29:58,960 --> 02:29:59,400
know.

1672
02:29:59,400 --> 02:30:01,680
Okay. I want to.

1673
02:30:01,680 --> 02:30:04,920
Sure, I want to do ls

1674
02:30:04,920 --> 02:30:09,080
and I want see which folder is there
inside?

1675
02:30:09,080 --> 02:30:11,480
Batch 11 is smart,

1676
02:30:11,480 --> 02:30:18,280
ABCD is the right.

1677
02:30:18,280 --> 02:30:18,840
Okay.

1678
02:30:18,840 --> 02:30:26,360
Now if I want to go into ABCD,
see the ABC.

1679
02:30:26,360 --> 02:30:27,120
Right.

1680
02:30:27,440 --> 02:30:30,520
Okay.

1681
02:30:30,520 --> 02:30:31,560
Perfect.

1682
02:30:31,560 --> 02:30:36,840
You were all able to do that
with me, right?

1683
02:30:36,840 --> 02:30:38,520
Okay. Pretty simple.

1684
02:30:38,520 --> 02:30:41,240
So we will be just learning one thing

1685
02:30:41,280 --> 02:30:44,280
more and we will be
done with these commands. So

1686
02:30:45,680 --> 02:30:47,040
I want to check

1687
02:30:47,040 --> 02:30:50,880
which is my current location, BWT.

1688
02:30:51,440 --> 02:30:52,200
Okay,

1689
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:56,160
if I want to move one back to my home

1690
02:30:56,160 --> 02:30:58,880
directory and now we know that
what is our home directory, right?

1691
02:30:59,400 --> 02:31:02,280
For me C users H speaks.

1692
02:31:02,320 --> 02:31:04,440
This is my home. Verity Correct.

1693
02:31:05,760 --> 02:31:10,080
It's going to be different for you guys.

1694
02:31:10,080 --> 02:31:15,000
If I want to move back to this point,
what I will do.

1695
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:21,240
C D dot, dot It will take me to batch
on the spot and then I'll do C again.

1696
02:31:21,400 --> 02:31:25,160
It will take me to desktop
and then I'll do KD dort again.

1697
02:31:26,040 --> 02:31:28,280
At that point I'll be at C users.

1698
02:31:28,800 --> 02:31:33,600
X Do you guys agree with that?

1699
02:31:33,600 --> 02:31:36,880
I'll have to do c D, Dada three dials.

1700
02:31:38,560 --> 02:31:41,960
Okay, so we have a shortcut.

1701
02:31:41,960 --> 02:31:45,640
Command for that, which is CB

1702
02:31:47,880 --> 02:31:53,400
Tilde.

1703
02:31:53,400 --> 02:31:55,920
This command takes you Mr.

1704
02:31:55,920 --> 02:32:00,360
Terminal back to the home directory.

1705
02:32:00,360 --> 02:32:04,720
Tilde This line is called Tilde.

1706
02:32:04,720 --> 02:32:09,000
Okay, I show you cannot do that
because it will expect it

1707
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:15,480
to be in front in that folder.

1708
02:32:15,480 --> 02:32:19,560
Okay, So if I do see the tuner
and now if I do p wd,

1709
02:32:19,560 --> 02:32:22,640
what do you guys suggest
should be the output

1710
02:32:23,040 --> 02:32:25,560
of my master terminal

1711
02:32:35,520 --> 02:32:38,960
which is C users HPC X for me.

1712
02:32:39,040 --> 02:32:39,760
Right.

1713
02:32:40,440 --> 02:32:42,880
So let's do pwt

1714
02:32:42,880 --> 02:32:45,440
it C users HPC

1715
02:32:45,480 --> 02:32:50,280
x, right.

1716
02:32:50,280 --> 02:32:53,120
Okay. Very good guys. Really good job.

1717
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,400
You guys have done an awesome job.

1718
02:32:56,400 --> 02:32:59,600
I'm really impressed and

1719
02:33:00,160 --> 02:33:03,200
let's take a break for one minute

1720
02:33:03,560 --> 02:33:17,160
and then we'll move forward.

1721
02:33:17,160 --> 02:33:21,840
Well, Joseph, you guys are great students,
so yeah, how to write Tilde

1722
02:33:21,840 --> 02:33:26,120
on the windows It's going to be along side

1723
02:33:26,440 --> 02:33:28,920
below your escape and on Mac.

1724
02:33:29,880 --> 02:33:32,520
Can somebody just help out your friends

1725
02:33:36,480 --> 02:33:36,840
saying,

1726
02:33:36,840 --> 02:33:42,920
okay, I'm coming to

1727
02:33:42,920 --> 02:33:48,960
that, I'm coming to that.

1728
02:33:48,960 --> 02:33:51,640
Okay, so it's 625 one, then break.

1729
02:33:51,640 --> 02:33:53,960
Okay, let's breathe then let's read out.

1730
02:33:53,960 --> 02:33:56,000
Let's relax ourselves.

1731
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:57,840
You know?

1732
02:33:57,840 --> 02:34:14,200
Then we'll begin.

1733
02:34:14,200 --> 02:34:15,320
Yes, it's.

1734
02:34:15,320 --> 02:34:23,840
It's morning now.

1735
02:34:25,680 --> 02:34:27,120
No, Aisha, I'm

1736
02:34:27,120 --> 02:34:45,320
from Pakistan. No,

1737
02:34:46,520 --> 02:34:57,800
not that much, but I watch the maths.

1738
02:34:57,800 --> 02:35:00,360
Okay, so it's.

1739
02:35:00,360 --> 02:35:02,560
It's one minute our break is over.

1740
02:35:02,720 --> 02:35:04,680
Okay, let's get back to work.

1741
02:35:04,680 --> 02:35:07,720
We can have chit chat off after that. Yes.

1742
02:35:07,840 --> 02:35:13,640
And from there.

1743
02:35:13,640 --> 02:35:16,160
Okay, guys, one minute is over. Right.

1744
02:35:16,160 --> 02:35:17,400
We will be having chit chat.

1745
02:35:17,400 --> 02:35:19,920
But for now,
we have a lot of work to cover.

1746
02:35:19,920 --> 02:35:22,640
Okay, So

1747
02:35:22,640 --> 02:35:24,800
why did we learn all of this?

1748
02:35:24,800 --> 02:35:29,480
To navigate into the different folders
and, you know, do stuff like that

1749
02:35:30,080 --> 02:35:36,160
we will be witnessing that right now.

1750
02:35:36,160 --> 02:35:40,400
So you guys have had clips installed
in your systems, right?

1751
02:35:41,440 --> 02:35:42,080
Can you open

1752
02:35:42,080 --> 02:35:46,120
that up for me?

1753
02:35:46,120 --> 02:35:46,440
Okay.

1754
02:35:46,440 --> 02:35:58,400
So just open up your clips and.

1755
02:35:58,400 --> 02:36:03,280
Okay, have you guys open it?

1756
02:36:03,960 --> 02:36:09,320
All of you.

1757
02:36:09,320 --> 02:36:10,120
Okay. It's all of us.

1758
02:36:10,120 --> 02:36:13,200
Open. Perfect.

1759
02:36:13,200 --> 02:36:19,880
How many projects do you have in there?

1760
02:36:19,880 --> 02:36:21,960
Wow, Four hot grade

1761
02:36:23,280 --> 02:36:25,120
millions. Wow.

1762
02:36:25,120 --> 02:36:28,240
Okay, So do you have this one
project named

1763
02:36:28,240 --> 02:36:34,800
Java Basic?

1764
02:36:34,800 --> 02:36:35,760
Okay,

1765
02:36:36,480 --> 02:36:39,000
so let's do this.

1766
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:42,200
I want you

1767
02:36:42,200 --> 02:36:45,440
to be able to move your terminal

1768
02:36:46,120 --> 02:36:53,560
to the folder Java Basic.

1769
02:36:53,560 --> 02:36:55,600
So this is the task
that we are going to do.

1770
02:36:56,200 --> 02:36:59,280
We want to be able to move our terminal

1771
02:36:59,680 --> 02:37:04,320
from home directory to the folder
where our Java Basic is.

1772
02:37:04,800 --> 02:37:15,760
How do we do that?

1773
02:37:15,760 --> 02:37:35,480
Well,

1774
02:37:35,480 --> 02:37:38,520
number one, okay,

1775
02:37:38,520 --> 02:37:42,600
if it doesn't have most of our Java basic,
it's going to have some other project.

1776
02:37:42,600 --> 02:37:44,520
You can use that.

1777
02:37:44,520 --> 02:37:49,960
Okay.

1778
02:37:49,960 --> 02:37:52,600
Okay. So what is going to be our very
first step?

1779
02:37:52,600 --> 02:37:56,520
I want you guys to guide me
as well as you know do.

1780
02:37:57,040 --> 02:38:00,960
Everything on your computer is also.

1781
02:38:00,960 --> 02:38:10,680
No, Alex, we are not doing that. The

1782
02:38:12,360 --> 02:38:16,280
first thing is that we want to find out

1783
02:38:17,360 --> 02:38:20,920
what is the location of our Java.

1784
02:38:20,920 --> 02:38:21,600
Right?

1785
02:38:22,560 --> 02:38:23,200
Perfect.

1786
02:38:23,200 --> 02:38:34,080
Perfect.

1787
02:38:34,080 --> 02:38:36,360
So how can we know that

1788
02:38:37,360 --> 02:38:40,520
in order to do that,
just go to your project.

1789
02:38:40,520 --> 02:38:42,240
If it's basic, that's fine.

1790
02:38:42,240 --> 02:38:46,040
If it's something else,
you guys can select any.

1791
02:38:46,080 --> 02:38:48,360
Any project, right click on it.

1792
02:38:49,200 --> 02:38:51,720
Go to properties

1793
02:38:56,280 --> 02:38:56,800
in there,

1794
02:38:56,800 --> 02:39:06,000
you'll see the location.

1795
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,400
Okay,
so what should be my next step? Guys?

1796
02:39:08,400 --> 02:39:19,680
Can someone guide me?

1797
02:39:19,680 --> 02:39:23,720
Well, okay.

1798
02:39:24,800 --> 02:39:29,120
Select any of your project
to which you want to navigate.

1799
02:39:29,800 --> 02:39:32,000
Right click on it.

1800
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:41,840
Then go to properties.

1801
02:39:41,840 --> 02:39:46,560
Okay,

1802
02:39:46,560 --> 02:39:50,400
Now I'll open up my Kit bash
and obviously for Windows users,

1803
02:39:50,400 --> 02:39:53,480
you can always make users,
you can use terminal.

1804
02:39:54,880 --> 02:39:57,360
So first of all, I'll do

1805
02:39:57,960 --> 02:40:04,240
which come on, mirror, step by step guys,
we need to move step by step.

1806
02:40:04,400 --> 02:40:05,640
No shortcuts fun.

1807
02:40:05,640 --> 02:40:08,040
Now when you will mature, you'll go up.

1808
02:40:08,040 --> 02:40:10,360
Then you can use shortcuts.

1809
02:40:10,360 --> 02:40:11,480
Okay, so be ready.

1810
02:40:11,480 --> 02:40:15,120
It says that my master terminal
is currently

1811
02:40:15,120 --> 02:40:19,840
in C uses HPC X, right?

1812
02:40:19,840 --> 02:40:21,320
Till HPC? Yes.

1813
02:40:21,320 --> 02:40:25,320
So what is the next folder to which

1814
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:31,240
I want to move my terminal?

1815
02:40:31,240 --> 02:40:33,640
Its atlas workspace.

1816
02:40:33,640 --> 02:40:38,400
But first I need to make sure
that workspace is in that location.

1817
02:40:38,400 --> 02:40:39,240
I'm not

1818
02:40:43,200 --> 02:40:45,960
so I can do else

1819
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:48,480
and it shows me that

1820
02:40:48,480 --> 02:40:55,280
it is there right?

1821
02:40:55,280 --> 02:40:57,640
So what is going to be my command

1822
02:41:00,920 --> 02:41:05,240
to move terminal to eclipse workspace

1823
02:41:06,360 --> 02:41:09,080
C D Eclipse

1824
02:41:11,840 --> 02:41:15,480
Workspace right.

1825
02:41:15,480 --> 02:41:17,720
I'll press enter

1826
02:41:19,800 --> 02:41:21,360
and then

1827
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:29,160
again TWD to make sure

1828
02:41:29,160 --> 02:41:33,000
I have reached this point.

1829
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:34,920
So I'm an eclipse workspace.

1830
02:41:34,920 --> 02:41:36,720
Okay, I am in Eclipse workspace.

1831
02:41:36,720 --> 02:41:38,800
So next caller is

1832
02:41:38,880 --> 02:41:42,560
Java base. It.

1833
02:41:42,560 --> 02:41:46,920
So first I want to make sure
that our basic is there

1834
02:41:48,320 --> 02:41:50,360
it is zero

1835
02:41:51,840 --> 02:41:54,720
if I want to go into that simply

1836
02:41:56,400 --> 02:42:03,000
c d java base it.

1837
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:04,400
So now we are.

1838
02:42:04,400 --> 02:42:09,040
Mr. Terminal is at
the location of our project.

1839
02:42:10,800 --> 02:42:12,400
What if I do

1840
02:42:12,400 --> 02:42:19,200
less at this point?

1841
02:42:19,200 --> 02:42:22,240
Mary were you able to locate it

1842
02:42:22,240 --> 02:42:30,040
in less?

1843
02:42:30,040 --> 02:42:30,440
Yeah.

1844
02:42:30,440 --> 02:42:32,600
You're spelling is wrong

1845
02:42:33,720 --> 02:42:34,200
for hard.

1846
02:42:34,200 --> 02:42:35,760
You must be having the same problem.

1847
02:42:35,760 --> 02:42:38,520
You can share the screenshot in support.

1848
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:40,320
Okay.

1849
02:42:40,320 --> 02:42:43,560
So let's do our last.

1850
02:42:43,560 --> 02:42:47,920
So in there
it shows me two folders s, r, c,

1851
02:42:48,240 --> 02:42:49,560
and then

1852
02:42:52,280 --> 02:42:53,640
if you do not have Java Basic,

1853
02:42:53,640 --> 02:43:01,200
you can choose any project.

1854
02:43:01,200 --> 02:43:04,000
Okay, so now if I want to

1855
02:43:06,240 --> 02:43:09,480
quickly look into my

1856
02:43:09,480 --> 02:43:12,400
Java basics
and make sure that these two folders

1857
02:43:12,400 --> 02:43:15,240
are over there,
I can simply right click on it

1858
02:43:17,480 --> 02:43:20,960
and then I can click on

1859
02:43:23,560 --> 02:43:24,720
where is that

1860
02:43:24,720 --> 02:43:30,200
option?

1861
02:43:30,200 --> 02:43:33,320
Yeah, properties and I can click on this

1862
02:43:33,960 --> 02:43:35,840
this arrow key.

1863
02:43:36,800 --> 02:43:38,560
It's going to open up that folder

1864
02:43:38,560 --> 02:43:44,040
for me.

1865
02:43:44,040 --> 02:43:48,240
If I go into Java basics,
I see that I have binary

1866
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:53,880
bean and sa c, these rest
or the folders are not displayed

1867
02:43:53,880 --> 02:43:58,520
because they are not actually,
you know, the proper folders.

1868
02:43:58,520 --> 02:44:01,760
They have a dot different extension.

1869
02:44:01,760 --> 02:44:06,400
So this command does not show the
these folders.

1870
02:44:06,400 --> 02:44:06,920
Okay.

1871
02:44:06,920 --> 02:44:13,400
So this is the main task that we will be
doing when we will be working with kids.

1872
02:44:13,400 --> 02:44:17,600
So tell me, guys,
if I asked at any point in time

1873
02:44:19,440 --> 02:44:21,040
that, Hey guys, I

1874
02:44:21,040 --> 02:44:26,040
want you to navigate your terminal
to one of your Java projects, Eclipse,

1875
02:44:26,400 --> 02:44:36,120
will you guys be able to do that
in no time?

1876
02:44:36,120 --> 02:44:36,840
Right.

1877
02:44:37,080 --> 02:44:38,280
It's pretty simple.

1878
02:44:38,280 --> 02:44:39,680
You guys will be able to do that.

1879
02:44:39,680 --> 02:44:42,600
I'm pretty sure about it. Okay.

1880
02:44:42,680 --> 02:44:45,600
So, yes,

1881
02:44:47,560 --> 02:44:52,640
for those of you,
if you are still struggling with it,

1882
02:44:52,880 --> 02:44:56,480
let me know at the end of class
so that I can help you out.

1883
02:44:56,480 --> 02:45:01,440
After the end of class, I'll still spend
5 minutes to make things more clear.

1884
02:45:02,280 --> 02:45:03,040
Okay,

1885
02:45:03,760 --> 02:45:07,440
let's take a break for 2 minutes,
and then we'll

1886
02:45:08,640 --> 02:45:12,720
discuss the new.

1887
02:45:12,720 --> 02:45:13,960
Yes, we can.

1888
02:45:13,960 --> 02:45:18,360
But for now, I'm not going to teach you
that because, you know, we want to move.

1889
02:45:18,360 --> 02:45:20,720
Stepwise shortcuts are there?

1890
02:45:20,720 --> 02:45:22,440
You guys will be using shortcuts

1891
02:45:22,440 --> 02:45:26,280
all the time, but always first
we have to learn the basics.

1892
02:45:26,280 --> 02:45:32,960
Okay, perfect.

1893
02:45:33,960 --> 02:45:34,240
Okay.

1894
02:45:34,240 --> 02:45:38,480
So meanwhile, tell me, guys,
what do you do apart from?

1895
02:45:38,480 --> 02:45:54,240
You know, coming to syntax
and attending the classes?

1896
02:45:54,240 --> 02:45:57,160
Okay. Wow.

1897
02:45:57,160 --> 02:46:07,080
I learned.

1898
02:46:07,080 --> 02:46:12,400
I will word that after, you know, after
the class and also during the class also.

1899
02:46:12,400 --> 02:46:13,920
Okay, So don't worry about that.

1900
02:46:13,920 --> 02:46:17,120
The word work word

1901
02:46:17,600 --> 02:46:21,000
teenager is a teenager. Word

1902
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:25,080
mom, duties, catcall.

1903
02:46:25,080 --> 02:46:27,520
Okay, Alex, that that's what we all do.

1904
02:46:28,600 --> 02:46:29,640
Work and forum.

1905
02:46:29,640 --> 02:46:32,200
Okay, great. That's great.

1906
02:46:32,200 --> 02:46:35,080
So you guys are all working

1907
02:46:35,080 --> 02:46:38,600
and, you know, taking classes
along with that.

1908
02:46:38,600 --> 02:46:41,640
That's really great.

1909
02:46:41,640 --> 02:46:59,600
Must be having a lot of hard time.

1910
02:46:59,600 --> 02:47:00,160
Okay.

1911
02:47:00,280 --> 02:47:02,520
You are a lucky one. That

1912
02:47:10,120 --> 02:47:12,000
so by the end of,

1913
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:14,880
you know, one or two months

1914
02:47:14,880 --> 02:47:17,240
it's like, you know,

1915
02:47:17,520 --> 02:47:20,640
this was our first class
by the end of two, two months, I guess

1916
02:47:20,760 --> 02:47:24,480
slowly you'll get to know each other
more and more over the time.

1917
02:47:25,440 --> 02:47:28,320
But for now, it's

1918
02:47:28,680 --> 02:47:30,480
a little bit

1919
02:47:30,960 --> 02:47:32,760
we are a little bit strangers
to each other.

1920
02:47:32,760 --> 02:47:34,440
So who was our great manager, by the way?

1921
02:47:34,440 --> 02:47:41,880
I forgot his name.

1922
02:47:41,880 --> 02:47:45,680
Okay.

1923
02:47:45,680 --> 02:47:46,320
Lubo.

1924
02:47:46,320 --> 02:47:49,600
Okay, little boy,
you are the break manager, okay?

1925
02:47:49,600 --> 02:47:51,600
Yes, the break is over.

1926
02:47:51,600 --> 02:47:54,120
So let's get back to our work

1927
02:47:54,120 --> 02:48:01,320
work.

1928
02:48:01,320 --> 02:48:03,200
So remember, guys, what you were talking.

1929
02:48:03,200 --> 02:48:04,680
We were talking about Gabe.

1930
02:48:04,680 --> 02:48:08,080
So we now understand that
what we are using get right?

1931
02:48:08,960 --> 02:48:11,360
We know that it's a volume control tool

1932
02:48:11,360 --> 02:48:14,600
and we know that way to use it
and stuff like that.

1933
02:48:15,920 --> 02:48:21,320
So you guys will be doing this.

1934
02:48:21,360 --> 02:48:21,720
Okay?

1935
02:48:21,720 --> 02:48:23,880
You are having your eclipse

1936
02:48:30,360 --> 02:48:31,320
and there you have

1937
02:48:31,320 --> 02:48:48,000
your Java project right?

1938
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:53,360
And inside this Java project
you have multiple folders, maybe

1939
02:48:53,480 --> 02:49:06,480
CRC and Binary.

1940
02:49:06,480 --> 02:49:07,920
Is it correct?

1941
02:49:07,920 --> 02:49:14,640
What are you is is this correct?

1942
02:49:14,640 --> 02:49:15,000
Okay.

1943
02:49:16,280 --> 02:49:18,880
If I tried to

1944
02:49:18,880 --> 02:49:22,400
draw everything that I have drawn
in Eclipse on your

1945
02:49:23,440 --> 02:49:25,640
Explorer window and computer,

1946
02:49:25,640 --> 02:49:28,120
I would say that you have a window

1947
02:49:29,040 --> 02:49:32,360
in which you have

1948
02:49:33,920 --> 02:49:35,640
a folder with that.

1949
02:49:35,640 --> 02:49:38,920
Let's see.

1950
02:49:38,920 --> 02:49:41,560
I'm just imagining this battle. Okay.

1951
02:49:41,560 --> 02:49:57,120
And the last thing is Java Project.

1952
02:49:57,120 --> 02:50:01,560
And in there
we have, let's say, two folders.

1953
02:50:01,920 --> 02:50:14,040
Okay, SRT and

1954
02:50:15,600 --> 02:50:18,680
then so

1955
02:50:21,360 --> 02:50:23,600
if I see this,

1956
02:50:23,600 --> 02:50:25,400
am I correct about this?

1957
02:50:25,400 --> 02:50:30,240
Like,
I can show you that also in f lives, I

1958
02:50:30,480 --> 02:50:33,240
Java and under it I have SRT

1959
02:50:34,120 --> 02:50:37,480
and inside my explorer also

1960
02:50:43,800 --> 02:50:45,200
inside my job basics.

1961
02:50:45,200 --> 02:50:49,160
I have been in SRT right.

1962
02:50:49,160 --> 02:50:54,400
And the location of my Java project.

1963
02:50:54,400 --> 02:50:56,760
I will go to this point. Okay.

1964
02:50:57,840 --> 02:51:00,760
So now this is the location

1965
02:51:01,280 --> 02:51:04,400
where we are writing our code, right?

1966
02:51:04,400 --> 02:51:05,600
Our Java code.

1967
02:51:05,600 --> 02:51:10,200
This is the location
where we are writing it.

1968
02:51:10,200 --> 02:51:11,320
If you want

1969
02:51:12,440 --> 02:51:16,840
to track this project using gift,

1970
02:51:18,480 --> 02:51:20,040
what we to do,

1971
02:51:20,040 --> 02:51:23,120
we need to create a repository.

1972
02:51:24,840 --> 02:51:34,320
At this point.

1973
02:51:34,320 --> 02:51:36,600
Do you guys agree with me?

1974
02:51:36,600 --> 02:51:40,680
We need to place a cupboard over there,

1975
02:51:41,280 --> 02:51:57,720
a locker room in that location.

1976
02:51:57,720 --> 02:51:58,200
Okay.

1977
02:51:58,200 --> 02:52:04,560
I'm going to repeat it again.

1978
02:52:04,560 --> 02:52:07,480
So I'm saying that

1979
02:52:07,480 --> 02:52:10,600
we are writing down our code
and it lives inside

1980
02:52:10,600 --> 02:52:14,360
Java project right?

1981
02:52:14,360 --> 02:52:18,160
If I want to get to track my codes,

1982
02:52:18,720 --> 02:52:21,200
what I need to do, I need to create

1983
02:52:22,160 --> 02:52:26,840
a I want geared actually
to create locker room

1984
02:52:26,840 --> 02:52:33,600
or a repository, right.

1985
02:52:33,600 --> 02:52:36,560
I want get to do that right.

1986
02:52:36,560 --> 02:52:38,960
Come on. You can see a locker room

1987
02:52:38,960 --> 02:52:42,120
repository all interchangeably used
for the same thing.

1988
02:52:42,840 --> 02:52:43,640
Okay.

1989
02:52:43,640 --> 02:52:46,600
I want get to create that.

1990
02:52:46,600 --> 02:52:50,680
First of all, the point is that what
will be the location of that

1991
02:52:51,640 --> 02:52:53,240
repository?

1992
02:52:53,240 --> 02:53:08,640
Can it be anywhere on the on the computer?

1993
02:53:08,640 --> 02:53:13,320
What if I place it
somewhere, you know, on my desktop

1994
02:53:13,320 --> 02:53:18,200
where my jello projects are not lying in.

1995
02:53:18,200 --> 02:53:19,040
Right.

1996
02:53:19,840 --> 02:53:22,320
It's not going to work.

1997
02:53:22,320 --> 02:53:28,040
Why? So this is the condition of get

1998
02:53:28,400 --> 02:53:33,360
it says that, hey, if you want me
to keep track of your goods,

1999
02:53:33,720 --> 02:53:37,240
you need to place my code

2000
02:53:37,960 --> 02:53:43,640
on the same location where your codes are.

2001
02:53:43,640 --> 02:53:47,920
Okay,

2002
02:53:47,920 --> 02:53:50,280
That's the condition
that we have to follow.

2003
02:53:51,200 --> 02:54:35,760
Let me write that down for you.

2004
02:54:35,760 --> 02:54:39,920
Okay, guys, here,
I want you to remember this line.

2005
02:54:39,920 --> 02:54:40,960
Okay?

2006
02:54:40,960 --> 02:54:43,000
And make sure
that you never make this mistake.

2007
02:54:43,440 --> 02:54:47,200
Everyone, I'm still telling you
you will be making this mistake

2008
02:54:47,400 --> 02:54:50,920
and even future, despite of me
telling you that that's totally fine.

2009
02:54:50,920 --> 02:54:52,480
That's how you learn.

2010
02:54:52,480 --> 02:54:57,200
But always, always make sure
that you are creating

2011
02:54:57,200 --> 02:55:00,720
that covered repository in right location.

2012
02:55:01,080 --> 02:55:02,160
Where is that?

2013
02:55:02,160 --> 02:55:11,480
Where is that location?

2014
02:55:11,480 --> 02:55:13,640
Where your codes are? Right.

2015
02:55:14,320 --> 02:55:16,920
I'm going to answer that

2016
02:55:19,520 --> 02:55:20,760
for a fact.

2017
02:55:21,920 --> 02:55:23,440
So for this

2018
02:55:23,440 --> 02:55:26,880
particular project that we have off

2019
02:55:26,880 --> 02:55:33,960
Java Basic,
what is going to be the location?

2020
02:55:33,960 --> 02:55:35,760
Let me show you.

2021
02:55:35,800 --> 02:55:39,040
If I go to properties

2022
02:55:39,680 --> 02:55:43,320
and I click on this show in System
Explorer, it's

2023
02:55:43,320 --> 02:55:45,960
going to open the folder for me.

2024
02:55:45,960 --> 02:55:48,280
Okay, So I'm in Java codes

2025
02:55:48,280 --> 02:55:53,920
in this folder.

2026
02:55:53,920 --> 02:56:00,440
No, Where are they?

2027
02:56:00,440 --> 02:56:01,200
Inside.

2028
02:56:01,200 --> 02:56:04,280
Do I have to go inside Java it.

2029
02:56:04,280 --> 02:56:07,680
Okay, inside Java Basic

2030
02:56:08,160 --> 02:56:09,560
in search of music.

2031
02:56:09,560 --> 02:56:13,480
I have S.R., C, Ben, and some other files
that are there.

2032
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:23,520
They are all the part
of my Java code right?

2033
02:56:23,520 --> 02:56:29,360
So I should create the cupboard
over here at this point.

2034
02:56:29,920 --> 02:56:32,640
Not inside s rc

2035
02:56:32,640 --> 02:56:36,760
not inside Bean
not inside any other folder.

2036
02:56:36,760 --> 02:56:40,400
I want to create it
at this particular location

2037
02:56:52,800 --> 02:56:54,040
I'm coming to that for

2038
02:56:54,040 --> 02:57:14,360
I'm coming to the okay,
So if we have a general project

2039
02:57:14,360 --> 02:57:20,040
and we want to get to keep track
of all of our codes in that project.

2040
02:57:20,760 --> 02:57:23,960
So the first step is
we have to ask, get to create a covered

2041
02:57:23,960 --> 02:57:27,040
repository at the same location
where our Java codes are.

2042
02:57:27,920 --> 02:57:34,240
Okay, now how do we do that?

2043
02:57:34,760 --> 02:57:36,600
I'm going to show you.

2044
02:57:36,600 --> 02:57:39,440
So first of all, the very first step

2045
02:57:40,080 --> 02:57:43,080
is, okay, so let me answer this question.

2046
02:57:43,080 --> 02:57:45,080
So it is look, is it look at it.

2047
02:57:45,080 --> 02:57:52,080
We're not SIRC Your job was Gerald.

2048
02:57:52,080 --> 02:58:07,800
Are you talking about your Java codes?

2049
02:58:07,800 --> 02:58:12,880
Okay, Your Java codes are inside SIRC,

2050
02:58:13,560 --> 02:58:17,320
but the other files that are there,
they are also going

2051
02:58:17,440 --> 02:58:21,000
be part of your Java project, Right?

2052
02:58:21,480 --> 02:58:23,280
So we created

2053
02:58:25,200 --> 02:58:27,960
inside that folder

2054
02:58:33,320 --> 02:58:33,760
question.

2055
02:58:33,760 --> 02:58:37,960
But you set store wherever our codes are,
restore all the programs on.

2056
02:58:37,960 --> 02:58:39,920
SIRC because

2057
02:58:40,200 --> 02:58:46,640
I'm going to tell you that.

2058
02:58:46,640 --> 02:58:48,840
So let me quickly answer that question.

2059
02:58:48,840 --> 02:58:52,240
So the question now here is that

2060
02:58:54,520 --> 02:58:56,160
let's say

2061
02:59:00,000 --> 02:59:02,520
this is our source

2062
02:59:02,520 --> 02:59:04,600
and inside that we have

2063
02:59:06,240 --> 02:59:08,160
different right

2064
02:59:08,160 --> 02:59:12,040
Class one, Class two or class two, right?

2065
02:59:12,360 --> 02:59:18,120
All the Java codes are inside that.

2066
02:59:18,120 --> 02:59:24,600
Are you guys with me?

2067
02:59:24,600 --> 02:59:25,720
Am I correct about this?

2068
02:59:25,720 --> 02:59:30,040
Right inside source folders,
we have class one, class to class.

2069
02:59:30,040 --> 02:59:33,320
See what our packages
you have created whatever there is.

2070
02:59:33,960 --> 02:59:38,320
Okay, apart from that,
let me create a bigger folder.

2071
02:59:38,320 --> 02:59:48,160
Also let me call it Java basics.

2072
02:59:48,160 --> 02:59:48,960
Okay.

2073
02:59:49,440 --> 02:59:51,320
So now

2074
02:59:52,760 --> 02:59:55,200
apart from this RC, you have let's see

2075
02:59:55,200 --> 02:59:59,400
some other folder of files, let's say bean

2076
03:00:00,360 --> 03:00:03,680
or you know, some file that you have

2077
03:00:08,600 --> 03:00:10,720
when you want to

2078
03:00:10,720 --> 03:00:14,160
create a repository for your chords,

2079
03:00:14,720 --> 03:00:20,400
you have option either
to created inside SRT

2080
03:00:20,920 --> 03:00:25,080
or inside class one or inside class two.

2081
03:00:25,080 --> 03:00:28,240
But what will happen
if you created inside class one?

2082
03:00:28,640 --> 03:00:31,440
Let's say
if you create this repository inside

2083
03:00:31,440 --> 03:00:35,640
class one, it's

2084
03:00:35,640 --> 03:00:40,040
only going to keep track of the codes
which are in your class one

2085
03:00:41,080 --> 03:00:46,960
right?

2086
03:00:46,960 --> 03:00:51,000
If you created in class two,

2087
03:00:51,000 --> 03:00:55,400
it will only keep track of your codes
in class two.

2088
03:00:56,400 --> 03:00:56,720
Okay.

2089
03:00:56,720 --> 03:01:01,840
What if you created inside SIRC only?

2090
03:01:01,840 --> 03:01:15,160
What if you created inside SIRC?

2091
03:01:15,160 --> 03:01:16,800
Then it will.

2092
03:01:16,800 --> 03:01:21,920
It will store everything which is inside
SARS in class one, Class two class, three.

2093
03:01:22,440 --> 03:01:26,400
Okay.

2094
03:01:26,400 --> 03:01:29,520
What if I create our opposing tree inside

2095
03:01:29,640 --> 03:01:43,800
our basics?

2096
03:01:43,800 --> 03:01:48,920
What if I create the repository
inside your business that it's to store

2097
03:01:48,960 --> 03:01:54,280
everything which is contained
inside our project, our basics, right?

2098
03:01:55,160 --> 03:01:57,960
So we can create it inside class.

2099
03:01:57,960 --> 03:01:59,520
We can create it inside class two.

2100
03:01:59,520 --> 03:02:03,200
But the best practice
for creating a repository

2101
03:02:03,200 --> 03:02:07,440
is that you create the repository
for the whole project

2102
03:02:07,680 --> 03:02:11,880
right?

2103
03:02:11,880 --> 03:02:15,880
So if I want to create repository
for the whole project, where should I be

2104
03:02:15,880 --> 03:02:23,200
creating it?

2105
03:02:23,200 --> 03:02:27,240
Inside Java Basics, right?

2106
03:02:27,240 --> 03:02:29,760
I should be creating it inside Jarvis's

2107
03:02:45,320 --> 03:02:47,000
nine will

2108
03:02:47,000 --> 03:02:51,760
automatically have everything
which is inside SIRC inside.

2109
03:02:51,960 --> 03:02:55,160
Then inside any text file

2110
03:02:55,160 --> 03:03:09,000
that is due.

2111
03:03:09,000 --> 03:03:16,560
Okay guys,
so this concept is clear to you right?

2112
03:03:16,560 --> 03:03:19,560
Okay, very good. Perfect.

2113
03:03:19,560 --> 03:03:24,000
So now we need to learn the next steps.

2114
03:03:24,000 --> 03:03:25,840
How to

2115
03:03:27,200 --> 03:03:28,400
navigate

2116
03:03:28,400 --> 03:03:33,400
to the folder where our Java project is.

2117
03:03:33,400 --> 03:03:34,480
We already know that.

2118
03:03:34,480 --> 03:03:35,600
I think we know.

2119
03:03:35,600 --> 03:03:37,040
No, no, no, no.

2120
03:03:37,040 --> 03:03:39,240
We don't need to spend time on it.

2121
03:03:39,240 --> 03:03:42,760
We learned it right.

2122
03:03:42,760 --> 03:03:46,280
The next step is how to create

2123
03:03:46,720 --> 03:03:49,360
our repository.

2124
03:03:49,480 --> 03:03:51,640
At that point

2125
03:03:54,240 --> 03:03:55,800
and then

2126
03:03:56,520 --> 03:03:58,920
how to store

2127
03:03:59,400 --> 03:04:01,680
and save our cool

2128
03:04:02,400 --> 03:04:06,720
in that repository.

2129
03:04:06,720 --> 03:04:07,720
And that's it.

2130
03:04:07,720 --> 03:04:11,040
Only two steps are left
and then we will be able

2131
03:04:11,040 --> 03:04:25,680
to store our goods inside that repository.

2132
03:04:25,680 --> 03:04:26,280
Okay, guys.

2133
03:04:26,280 --> 03:04:38,160
So this is what we will be covering
tomorrow.

2134
03:04:38,160 --> 03:04:41,360
Okay.

2135
03:04:41,360 --> 03:04:43,760
But we're not done yet.
We are not done yet.

2136
03:04:44,160 --> 03:04:45,400
Wait, wait.

2137
03:04:45,400 --> 03:04:47,720
Today, the last thing that we want to do

2138
03:04:53,080 --> 03:04:55,360
before we end the session.

2139
03:04:55,360 --> 03:04:58,080
No, just just 5 minutes.

2140
03:04:58,080 --> 03:05:11,400
We want we have one task at hand.

2141
03:05:11,400 --> 03:05:13,520
We still have 5 minutes, guys. 5 minutes?

2142
03:05:13,520 --> 03:05:15,120
Only 5 minutes. Yeah.

2143
03:05:15,120 --> 03:05:18,760
Just 57 will end after 5 minutes.

2144
03:05:19,680 --> 03:05:23,280
Okay,
so we still need to configure our target.

2145
03:05:23,280 --> 03:05:28,720
So first, when we install get,
we have done no configuring.

2146
03:05:28,720 --> 03:05:31,080
We have, you know,

2147
03:05:31,080 --> 03:05:32,200
we just install it.

2148
03:05:32,200 --> 03:05:35,040
We have not to tell the get that.

2149
03:05:35,040 --> 03:05:36,480
Who are we?

2150
03:05:36,480 --> 03:05:41,400
What is our email address, what is the
username password and stuff like that.

2151
03:05:41,400 --> 03:05:45,520
Right.

2152
03:05:45,520 --> 03:05:47,560
So we need to configure give

2153
03:05:48,640 --> 03:05:53,960
and tell is then what is our username
and what is our password?

2154
03:05:53,960 --> 03:05:57,480
We have to do this for that.

2155
03:05:57,480 --> 03:06:00,360
Also, we have commands

2156
03:06:03,320 --> 03:06:05,920
which you guys will only run once

2157
03:06:16,080 --> 03:06:17,240
when you install it.

2158
03:06:17,240 --> 03:06:19,960
You only need to run these commands
only once.

2159
03:06:20,880 --> 03:06:23,680
Okay. We will be right through them.

2160
03:06:23,680 --> 03:06:28,560
I guess it will take around 15 minutes,
so let's postpone it for tomorrow.

2161
03:06:29,040 --> 03:06:31,560
And I guess it's good to

2162
03:06:34,200 --> 03:06:37,840
leave the lecture at this point.

2163
03:06:37,840 --> 03:06:38,760
Okay.

2164
03:06:38,960 --> 03:06:41,720

2165
03:06:41,760 --> 03:06:44,320

with you.

2166
03:06:44,320 --> 03:06:45,240
I don't mind that.

2167
03:06:45,240 --> 03:06:49,000
And let me show you one thing.

2168
03:06:49,000 --> 03:06:51,560
I was telling you to not make notes.

2169
03:06:51,560 --> 03:06:51,920

2170
03:06:51,920 --> 03:06:56,240

2174
03:07:04,360 --> 03:07:09,640
