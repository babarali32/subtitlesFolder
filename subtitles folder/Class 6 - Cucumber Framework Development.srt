1
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,280
Orchestra.

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,880
And so last number six, so far, we own

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,880
some of the marks of framework,
complete parts of Mr.

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,360
D as a tool, complete part of the timber.

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:26,280
It is a two day in some part of the field,
but it provides a lot of room.

6
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,560
But right now we are using that.

7
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,200
And so if I take a look

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,000
of all the structure that we have here,

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,360
we have deepest functionality
in our teamwork or not

10
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,640
in our framework supports

11
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,840
multi
or non behavioral driven development.

12
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,240
We are writing scenarios
based on the behavior

13
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,760
and we are executing this values.

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,120
So we have very deep framework.

15
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,720
At the same time, my groups are working

16
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,360
across multiple sets of data gathering,

17
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:08,320
so their definition of data driven
testing is in my one script,

18
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,800
execute across multiple source of data
recorder directly when visiting

19
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:15,480
this or

20
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:20,160
do we have a digital testing
approach was in our playbook.

21
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,400
We have the exact opposite it.

22
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,600
So when when we talk about any framework

23
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,120
that supports more than one behavior,
for example, we did integer

24
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,920
they this deep boot inventory
look and we call this type of playing

25
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,520
but it is hybrid finger, what we call
it was

26
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,200
recorded hybrid finger because we have
many pieces to try, many features to play.

27
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:47,760
Right.

28
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,600
We can pause the data
either from the proper display,

29
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,720
we can pass the data from the table,
we can position it from examples table.

30
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,000
We can pass the data from exit by correct.

31
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,160
We have all these functionalities
implemented

32
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,760
in our framework or not, and

33
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,600
so now this

34
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,520
is a good

35
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,200
framework, supports

36
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,840
ambiguity and internally.

37
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:32,800
But this now yesterday

38
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,200
we learned one very important topic
that was busting their data

39
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,000
from Excel fine rate, right,

40
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,320
is passing their data from Excel by

41
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,520
unsolvable

42
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,800
of students rate to join me
after the class.

43
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,080
Then I was resolved.

44
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,200
What is a majority of the students
were having a very small problem.

45
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,280
What was their problem was the

46
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,280
data is are not using
my code is the difference one

47
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,880
second thing

48
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,120
they guys are waiting some melt keys

49
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,800
in their data in that exploit
and that's why you're getting

50
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,160
what is called it is should not be getting
to sequence date.

51
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,920
I've seen this in five six students.
Why is it so?

52
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,240
Because we are not passing the data
and we are just keep cheating

53
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,000
in the exam reading code
that there is a problem with the code.

54
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,520
Not there is not a problem with the code.

55
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,400
Right.

56
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,200
The problem is with Billington
detailed because of by

57
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,520
education.

58
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,440
So please provide the data and the keys

59
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,800
which we must return, the keys
which we must accept.

60
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,520
Find it open minus

61
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,240
these keys which we are passing.

62
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,040
First name, middle name,
last name for do grab

63
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,480
these keys should match with the keys

64
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,480
which you are providing in

65
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,600
which you are providing key and right.

66
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:07,120
If these keys are not matching,
they're definitely yaml as delivered.

67
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,760
So these keys,
if they're matching, definitely

68
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:16,200
you will get an edge
that someone was passing last name.

69
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,360
There but without space.

70
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,640
And here someone passing
data like the asked this need

71
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:26,040
how can it be match you're providing
different keys it's for possible rate

72
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,240
so make sure when you're passing the data
it should be matched

73
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,600
what the change should

74
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,840
be rate causing.

75
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,440
Yep, because we provided the name
as the employee data to the sheet name

76
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,880
someone had already sheet one new sheet.

77
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,000
Something like this.

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,760
Just because I paused
the name of the student

79
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,040
is employed
in a improvement positive employee blank.

80
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,360
I explained to time that we are passing
employee data here

81
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,320
because we had this cheat
name already available in Excel workbook.

82
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,800
If you have that name

83
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,480
stored, must

84
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,560
write basic,

85
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:13,200
so please take care when you are writing
the call rate from starting to end us

86
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,960
to observe how I am writing,
What are the points I'm explaining?

87
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,400
What are the points
we need to focus on more rate.

88
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,440
These are the things we need to take.

89
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,680
You know, and then when you are done
with your writing that would

90
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,960
and you come across any errors
or what you have to do, in that case,

91
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,040
you have to simply match your code
with my good.

92
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,160
The very first approach
should be against it and never believe in

93
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,400
copying best, but combine good
which is available in the repository.

94
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,040
Right in the repository.

95
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,800
This code is for your friends

96
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,720
so that you can have to copy
what is working, what is not working.

97
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,760
Now you can compare
both the copies that which one is working.

98
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,880
This one already.

99
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,200
And what is missing here,
why this one is not working.

100
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,440
And then you can predict

101
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,920
the student

102
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,960
along the wall.

103
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,160
Where were you in the last class?

104
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:09,800
You were not there.

105
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,800
Yes. Here we have to change the sheet name
and then whatever the key is to be

106
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,120
at a passing the desk,
we have to change the pseudonym here.

107
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,080
For example, you're going to pass
this time new immigrants, right?

108
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,240
So that the sheet name is new employee.

109
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,720
So lost new employee,
then you're accelerating what it will do.

110
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,520
It will read

111
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,400
here and it will read

112
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,480
which file from here
because the workbook is

113
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,120
it will read a new employee
spot, exemplar plate.

114
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,880
And here, whatever the guidance
you're providing, just provide those keys

115
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,160
instead of this keys.

116
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,440
And this gives us another one
independently.

117
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,480
You can work on that and you can simply
use those because Xerox was a good work.

118
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,440
So now there so I told
this one is a global function, right?

119
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,040
You just need to change.

120
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,600
The name of the sheet
tells the only thing you have to

121
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:24,800
bring on.

122
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,520
You get that.

123
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,200
But why does it get I didn't just

124
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,720
want.

125
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,720
All right, so now

126
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,720
should we start this

127
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,360
knowing?

128
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,200
No, no, no sheet

129
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:59,400
is a part of your workbook? Yes.

130
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,600
What are we are we are going property.

131
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,080
We are going for associates.

132
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,040
I know, I know.

133
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,960
This question. Was there.

134
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,640
We will go to that.

135
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,080
So Arena, if we are changing

136
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,640
the complete workbook,
then we have to change the back.

137
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,080
If we are just changing the sheet inside

138
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,320
same book, then
why do we need to change the constancy?

139
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,080
This constant
is returning the same workbook.

140
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,440
See, this is the same workbook.

141
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,640
Inside this workbook
I can have multiple sheet.

142
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,480
They just delete the source history.

143
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,200
The source system.

144
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,680
So we don't need to change the source.

145
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,520
We have to change only the sheet here.

146
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:41,960
There's

147
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,040
I hope you're not getting confused.

148
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,400
It would be sheet minimal workbook.

149
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,160
No need to shoot for a new one.

150
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,120
Note that is workbook.

151
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,800
In workbook we have multiple sheet

152
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,200
o key one.

153
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,800
Right?

154
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,160
No reason the most one

155
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,880
posting post
was think that someone was asking

156
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,440
to check the code for employing straight.

157
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,960
I'll be right for the verification part.

158
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,240
Let's do it

159
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,360
now. You'll see.

160
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,840
I give you the hand in the same scenario.

161
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,520
Can I write the code
in the same scenario with it?

162
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,680
But it will be efficient. Word

163
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:37,320
nights.

164
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,800
You keep open the application, you

165
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,160
you see,

166
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,360
when I'm trying to add a new employee
by default, it is giving me one employee

167
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,840
could.

168
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:01,160
Is this correct?

169
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,280
Five So before adding the new employee.

170
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:04,680
Right.

171
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,960
What I will do when I'm filling the data.

172
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,720
When I'm filling the data,
I will capture this employee

173
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,080
so that one's night and the employee

174
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,920
I will simply search employee
by the member of the scenario

175
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:22,080
we can start employed by do is one is bet
81 is by me and this put everyone

176
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,960
remember to search by 80, search by name.

177
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,680
And this idea is generating by default.

178
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,720
Correct.

179
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,240
So let's see how we can grab this.

180
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,360
I let me show you.

181
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,880
Let me show this bird

182
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,480
you see here

183
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,680
in this particular one,

184
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,400
it says I text name value and 80.

185
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,080
Can you see in value
it is providing with the employee Everyone

186
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,320
and everyone see this

187
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,680
now I'm not I'm negative selenium.

188
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,680
You tell me this

189
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:15,000
now. Tell me
when it comes to your beautiful selenium.

190
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
In selenium, that is a command.

191
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,680
It is a command called

192
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,120
good.

193
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:33,520
It is indeed a command and selenium.

194
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,040
This.

195
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,200
So what we can do,
we can get the end of what

196
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,520
we can get the attribute on really simple

197
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,760
first put first

198
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,400
let's do it and stored it somewhere. Okay.

199
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,040
Distorted some of it

200
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,440
but story after adding the employee,
we can search it

201
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,680
using this particular string
of this particular value, cut it

202
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:05,320
and then whatever that data will be there
we can simply be defined ending the

203
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,960
with the data passing
from what exactly right.

204
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,400
So the force

205
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,960
super example we are getting after
searching the employee that explains the

206
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:18,280
so we can check whether we're passing
the implement understood

207
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,400
understood what we are going to implement.

208
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,520
So let's
go ahead and do so very first thing

209
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,560
when posting
when I'm adding the employee here.

210
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,440
So after ending was name, middle
name and last name

211
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,520
right here only operating post name,

212
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,480
middle name and ask me,

213
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,160
I'm going to get the attribute,
I'm going to get the attributes.

214
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,600
So what will be
the entry and writing element

215
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,120
employed?

216
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,640
I need this request to do.

217
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,800
I don't

218
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,400
find it linked.

219
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,000
Right.

220
00:12:53,840 --> 00:13:02,760
And this employee may be part one.

221
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:08,560
I. What is the id it will keep?

222
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,120
I id its employer.

223
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,680
It is simple.

224
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,760
We can take my own name is this.

225
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,240
We can take one name and

226
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,480
personal

227
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:28,800
P60 employee.

228
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,200
Now what I'm doing
See I'm working employed.

229
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,160
I don't

230
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,440
date attribute based on work

231
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,320
value and this value This value.

232
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,040
I'm going to struggle with this value.

233
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,280
I'm going to store, let's say one string.

234
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,280
I don't know whether it is one, two,
three years, one,

235
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,360
two, three, four, five, whatever.

236
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,520
So it could be spring,
it could be anything. Right.

237
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,840
So I'm writing here employee I.D..

238
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,120
Well,
which I'm going to store in this history.

239
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,560
So first, when
I'm going to actually add one employee,

240
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,960
it will store my employer identity
getting from here

241
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,560
for dignity, getting.

242
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:23,200
Is this correct?

243
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,720
And now, after this.

244
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,240
After this, what I'm going to do see here

245
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,760
when I go to this particular bar trade
see button after clicking on

246
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:36,280
still the assertion,
what we have to do, right?

247
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,240
So what assertion? You see,

248
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,000
when I added the employee
after adding the employee

249
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,880
coming on to this particular beach,
let me take some random

250
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,080
first

251
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,480
see employee I.D.

252
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,400
insist

253
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:13,840
firm.

254
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,200
So now I'm coming out to this beach.

255
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,880
Correct.

256
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,600
It is taking me to this particular beach,
but I have to really find it.

257
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,960
My employee is available on
in the list of the employees are not.

258
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,280
This is the page. I see the
this puts their details.

259
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,040
Beach.

260
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,640
I'm not going to work on this person
who didn't speak.

261
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,160
I am going to work on employee list.

262
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,280
So first,
after coming on to this particular screen,

263
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,280
after clicking on
See It button that I have to click

264
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,160
nice first I have to click on

265
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,760
employee list.

266
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,040
So let's go to the employee list
and approximately

267
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,200
want employees
to create what I have to do.

268
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,800
I have to take the I.D.

269
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,240
So this ID we are getting from this

270
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,240
this I.D.

271
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,520
we're getting from where we have
already decided we get should this I.D.

272
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,200
while adding the new connect

273
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,920
categories.

274
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,400
So now in a framework,
we are entering one I.D.

275
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:27,080
any using Bank 81 or further location,
but it's not passing anything.

276
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,080
We are just

277
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,800
capturing something from the application
and using it for further operations.

278
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,080
That's what we are going to

279
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,200
let me do it.

280
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,400
So first

281
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,080
posting first,
when what I need to do is post,

282
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:44,000
I need to search this employee
list, right?

283
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:48,400
This one menu I look at.

284
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,400
So 10 minutes of it
should I need obviously.

285
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,360
But I think what we need

286
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,320
of obviously.

287
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,480
So let me write that element

288
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,520
and this is equals to private or

289
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,360
by non I.D.

290
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,320
and this is the embassy

291
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,240
after

292
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,040
the address input everything on here

293
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,440
and what I'm going to do see, I'm
going to write first check here.

294
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,680
I am concerned in this 80 part

295
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,000
so it would take to look for this 80

296
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,200
because this search employee,

297
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,200
even though we have already contributed
one time, if you remember

298
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,720
remember here also we have used this boxy

299
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,080
individual, this name, last name
clicked on separately trade such 80.

300
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,560
We have done it earlier as well,
but now it will do it once again.

301
00:17:54,560 --> 00:18:02,040
So what I'm doing here first
I'm going to click on this employee list.

302
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,640
And then the second thing is

303
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,160
employee I.D.

304
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,320
So free

305
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:17,400
right?

306
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,480
Is the first person for

307
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:27,720
the right employee to

308
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:33,320
search for student delegates
in this state used in this.

309
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,520
And key is what we have to do,
which data we have to pass

310
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,600
from where

311
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,720
the screen right from this particular is.

312
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:47,280
This is an independent
winning the bus current

313
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:49,640
cook.

314
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,160
So let me pass you

315
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,520
because this thing I'm doing is

316
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,920
tell me if I'm going.

317
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,240
Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir.

318
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,480
After clicking on Employee 88 employee

319
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,840
and entering
the data is what I have to do next.

320
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,000
You I bench duty? Yes, sir. Correct.

321
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,680
I i i It means

322
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,520
I have to click on this with the

323
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,960
click button

324
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,880
so it will do it.

325
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,720
So here
also I'm going to search on this part

326
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,040
and here in the search
button I'm getting this 80

327
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,360
just getting gates

328
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,960
basically

329
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,040
search.

330
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,720
Let them speak to us to try to

331
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,600
find out I.D.

332
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,520
And this is I'm crossing
and then I'm trying to search.

333
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,200
But people don't speak

334
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,320
one syllable.

335
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,000
Just watch, don't break.

336
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,440
Just understand.

337
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,520
All of them did

338
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,880
a request
just what I have, what I'm doing.

339
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,640
Don't tape anything.

340
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:11,440
In the end,
if nothing, you will get the complete

341
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,880
working quote.

342
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:21,240
Yeah, it's my humble request.

343
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,720
I can't keep them. Why?

344
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,800
Why? See,
but it's good that you write late.

345
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,440
But for us to note understanding
if you write it would be a problem

346
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,760
it after the last the next class

347
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:40,280
you have 21 hours.

348
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:45,240
No I want us to just see because
even if you miss a small point

349
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,520
during makes Venetian and after,
sometimes you guys lost

350
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,440
a completely
because of that particular one.

351
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,320
Okay. Yes.

352
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:02,840
Yes. Correct.

353
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,120
Now the main part starts here

354
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,560
and you let us

355
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,800
know before starting what today They
this book

356
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,640
must never sit by anything.

357
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,160
Never, ever.

358
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:18,160
I always did just watch it.

359
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:22,320
So next time, if you guys
have to do anything, then I will see it.

360
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:22,640
Just.

361
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:30,200
I could have been his.

362
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,680
You are like Zima

363
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,560
already, guys.

364
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:50,200
Shall we proceed for that?

365
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,560
Now compare them.

366
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,240
Okay, sir.

367
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,160
Thank you.

368
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm. I'm in, sir.

369
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,800
I will

370
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,280
now see what I'm going to do here.

371
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,080
Let's search for any employee.

372
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,000
Looks at this employee.

373
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,600
I searched for this input.

374
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,680
Can you see this employee's
coming under this particular table?

375
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,280
Right. And this table should read them.

376
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:18,960
How many employees against the employee
and how many employees are true?

377
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,120
That one.

378
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,440
This is the exploded there.

379
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,400
I got stuck and now that's my I'm

380
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,160
sorry so nasty in this particular people

381
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,360
if I berating one employee
and then the data against the employee

382
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:40,440
and should be unique
and if one employee I'm passing

383
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,800
it should return
how many employees against there Just one.

384
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,400
If I'm getting one or more, the two
or more they do.

385
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,480
It means there is a problem
with the system

386
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,680
that it is providing a multiple employee
rate against just one employee.

387
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,120
This should be great.

388
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,680
So first we will break this part.

389
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,680
First, we will check how many details I'm

390
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:06,160
getting from this particular one

391
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,280
and if it is returning,
just one point rate.

392
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:13,240
So we take all of these in the list
one by one, one by one.

393
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,240
Okay, let's do it.

394
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,040
So I'm going to take first
I'm showing you one thing.

395
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,600
I'm seeing the list.

396
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,240
And in this list,
I'm going to take the above element.

397
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,160
Right?

398
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:29,120
The element I'm taking the raw data
which loaded this little.

399
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,400
And you see these are 2333 to double zero.

400
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,280
The data of this rule.

401
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,240
I need to be in my list.

402
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,320
How come here

403
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:48,080
in inspect.

404
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,520
Yes, yes. It's between.

405
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:54,640
Let me explain this to everyone.

406
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,400
Now. Here you see, what I'm going to do is

407
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,600
this is my table, right?

408
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,240
So here

409
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:10,080
this is my table
with search results three.

410
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,600
And inside this table, if I go

411
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,760
open this particular part

412
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,080
inside this table, if I go

413
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,360
in, I am taking

414
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,400
you. There you go.

415
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,440
Here. You see, this is the dessert table.

416
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,480
I can't right now.

417
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,440
If I go under this table.

418
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,360
Under this table.

419
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:42,480
Right.

420
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:42,960
You'll see.

421
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,600
This is the first one for the trade.

422
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,400
So we don't need it.

423
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,200
We need this particular one.

424
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,520
If we open this part, can you see this?

425
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,560
It is giving me one by one all the data

426
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:59,360
and everyone's need under
this is equal respectively.

427
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,960
I got this tea body

428
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,720
and inside this tea body I got this diet,
which is a stressful room.

429
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,880
Inside this row.

430
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,920
I'm getting this data one by one.

431
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,440
So this is my table.

432
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,040
Which table

433
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:17,000
is this case?

434
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,200
This is able.

435
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,320
So how to interact with the table?

436
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,520
Let me show you right here
the presentation start this time.

437
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,760
I'm going to make one simple painting.

438
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,600
Right?

439
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,880
So this is my table.

440
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,320
Let me be more specific here.

441
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,680
I'm is equal to.

442
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,320
But is it stable one on one regard?

443
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:42,720
If you want to be more specific
than the dialogs so you can use from here,

444
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,600
that bag is table
big fight inside this deck.

445
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,520
What we need next case.

446
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:53,040
We need the body

447
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,920
right inside before leaving India.

448
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:02,000
Now you see,
we go to this to this students

449
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,160
when I see this particular rule.

450
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,920
So it should retain the rules
according to the number of employees.

451
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,360
Since I have just one employee, it is
returning me ₹1 by multiple employees.

452
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,800
It will return me multiple rules. Right?

453
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,080
So the ideal

454
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,040
functionality is working
when I observe it manually.

455
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,040
When I need to take this functionality,
my permission is correct.

456
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,640
So how we do it?

457
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,120
Let me simply copy this particular part

458
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,640
and let me go here
and I'm will do right here.

459
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,560
Driver door
nice find elemental find elements

460
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,760
list of element.

461
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:44,920
This kind of elements by dark

462
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,960
this time not already expert
and this is the value.

463
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,120
First thing I have to do
first thing I have to do here

464
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:59,160
is this correct?

465
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:03,760
Is this correct.

466
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,200
Now see using for for a reason.

467
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,240
So to get one by one, insert this dear.

468
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,240
How many do I have? I don't know.

469
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,760
I don't know how many data
I Let's take this data one by one integer

470
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,200
is equal to zero.

471
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,640
I is less than your true

472
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:27,000
detect our size

473
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,080
and then I plus plus

474
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,600
my I'm using follow any question

475
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,880
during the experiment.

476
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:41,360
The result for loop is
please take me is pigment number one.

477
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,000
It initiates the volume integral.

478
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,600
Just one second. Is that technician.

479
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,280
I want to check my block of code
which I am writing in

480
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:53,360
my loop
will be executed in the third statement.

481
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,960
I will always execute
after the execution of my code is done.

482
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,240
So three statements we have, right?

483
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,240
One is already done
because I'm going to initialize the I

484
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:08,280
by zero and now in the second one,
the second statement which I provided.

485
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,240
Right.

486
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,720
This part will be executed
based on the block of code

487
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,280
which I'm going
to read under this for loop.

488
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,240
How many students?

489
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,160
Three, three grade.

490
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,120
So based on the science, we will take

491
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,040
all required, so not let me do it.

492
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,600
So first I'm going to check whether I am

493
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,880
inside this group or not
if there is any problem or not.

494
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,320
So it kind of small statements unquote

495
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,680
inside my loop

496
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:49,800
because I'm inside of my loop
rate in this loop.

497
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:55,280
What I'm going to do see, I'm
going to do the data so rotate.

498
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,000
I want to get off
I it means based on everything,

499
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,080
I'm reading the data
and then capturing the big stuff like

500
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,360
and just food raw data don't get off by.

501
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:14,080
If I his first one, second one
I want third one, I have the fourth one,

502
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:14,840
I have three.

503
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:18,120
And then again next one,
every single cent from the rule.

504
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,920
Now, whatever the text I am receiving,
I need to storage.

505
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,240
So we're getting so little stored it going

506
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,520
is visual text that is obedient.

507
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,520
What I'm going to define to control next.

508
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,480
It will contain my data.

509
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,920
Understood

510
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,200
and to support everyone.

511
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,040
I simply force simply force

512
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:46,800
to let me put this data,
bring this data, read

513
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,920
whatever the data I'm
getting from this particular

514
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,920
rule after I'm reading this rule,
one moment, one by one,

515
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,080
whatever the data, I'm getting, I'm
going to put that

516
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,320
in this text.

517
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:07,840
Is this clear to everyone?

518
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,160
So now, now what I'm going to do is see

519
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,000
I'm going to provide associates

520
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:16,800
grade.

521
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,640
I'm going to provide a solutions
in order to

522
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,480
I need associates.

523
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,760
So fine to use assertions.

524
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:31,600
What I'm going to do
is first, I'm going to capture their data

525
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:36,960
from my cellphone and their data,
which is coming from my application.

526
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,920
And then I will compare
both this data, correct.

527
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:45,440
So their data, which is coming from my application, is available here in your text,

528
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:50,760
available here in your text or not me

529
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,920
Okay, So now let's do it.

530
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,400
Let's do it. First.

531
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,040
Let's understand
in which automation we're getting this

532
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,640
data first,
let me explain you something important.

533
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,560
So let me open this part here.

534
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,760
I'm going to work with this

535
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,560
just one embroidery
because I don't want to waste much time.

536
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,200
One, two, three.

537
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,040
One, two, three.

538
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,600
One, two, three, five.

539
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,400
I'm going to see just one employee.

540
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,480
I'm thinking as of now.

541
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,560
Okay, now let me go to one of application.

542
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:28,480
So this time, this time, if I go into
my first, I'm just checking these again.

543
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,880
I'm saying I'm just checking read logic
what kind of automate we are getting

544
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,400
for the data from the room,
from the from the people of the employee.

545
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:44,960
So first let me open it.

546
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,640
It came here

547
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,360
it right here,

548
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,200
click on beam.

549
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,720
Click on an employee.

550
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,640
I've been clicking on third employee

551
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,960
in the data compatibility

552
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,000
in here.

553
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,640
Go to employee list.

554
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,600
It can order this

555
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,120
search option, go to their data,

556
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,600
get me to this particular point
and then closed.

557
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,240
Fine, fine.

558
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:19,480
Now you see here I got there
did not in this one.

559
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,920
Can you see

560
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,280
they scanned everyone's need

561
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,600
first

562
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,920
post Let me copy this data.

563
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,640
Right.

564
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:39,000
Whatever the data I got here,

565
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,240
it means what it is giving me
first is what

566
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,320
post is what employee

567
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,360
Space Force to me is based.

568
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,680
Middle name is based.

569
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:57,160
Last name, right?

570
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,160
Yeah, because it shows already.

571
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,080
It shows us already this
and against this employed.

572
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,080
The data already exist.

573
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,920
Okay.

574
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,000
It shows us already or not.

575
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,600
That's why
this is a sustainability of the system.

576
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,520
Great.

577
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,600
So now. Now what I'm.

578
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,960
What I'm saying is basically
we are getting first employee

579
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,760
I.D., then first name, then really?

580
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,760
And then lastly, right now
let's see how I'm going to work with it,

581
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,000
how I'm going to do it, which is

582
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,560
in this part in the root text.

583
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,840
I got this due date from the application.

584
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:38,760
Now the same font
I need to make from the data

585
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,360
which I'm getting from my Excel, like

586
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,240
from my Excel
based on within the data. Why?

587
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,760
Because we need to provide a solutions
to match the values

588
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,240
and to provide a solutions we need.

589
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:56,000
We need some data from Excel Fight
so let's make a string in the same quantum

590
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,320
leap.

591
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,800
In this to implement,
we need to make a string.

592
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,800
So how could we see?

593
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,960
First, we need to employ

594
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,000
any relevant contact.

595
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,160
Is this correct?

596
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,800
Case was to

597
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:14,560
add two values together in this print

598
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:18,040
which operator we use

599
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,360
to add to. We're losing the string we use

600
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,560
in condemnation rate.

601
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,280
So let me use concatenation here plus sign

602
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,120
and I'm using this space as required

603
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,440
because you see there is a space
in between this particular park.

604
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,920
Can you see it?

605
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,920
You see there is a space in between
your employ and enforce them with a name.

606
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:45,200
Last name. Right.

607
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,280
So now I'm going to let you do this

608
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,480
to get the value from my map.

609
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,800
Can I use this dart get?

610
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:58,080
And here it would be mine on both days

611
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:03,160
and then again this time one more space,
less time left.

612
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,360
So this time I'm asking my

613
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,440
site space to sign my

614
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,560
own date.

615
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,800
I'm getting the value for my

616
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,640
bottom line.

617
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:24,080
Must be whatever the string I'm depending.

618
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:29,200
I'm going to see
if there's a string in my expect the data.

619
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,280
Now see this

620
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,640
in this particular part.

621
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,040
Any question

622
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,840
students?

623
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,800
Does it make sense?

624
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,400
Does it make sense?

625
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,520
What I'm doing

626
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,760
now first

627
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,360
first, let's simply simply create
this expected it also.

628
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,400
So here not

629
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,320
one is from here, one is from here.

630
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:15,680
Silva
What are our noisy two values we got?

631
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,600
The one is from application, one is from

632
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,440
excellent find. Great.

633
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,720
First, let's bring both these values
and then see how things work.

634
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:31,080
Okay, so let me run it again.

635
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,480
This doesn't make sense

636
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:38,400
what we are doing here.

637
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:49,760
Let's.

638
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,520
Yeah.

639
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,920
We have a company already to this point.

640
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,640
See, that is the problem.

641
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,160
It says user exist.

642
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,640
We need to change the user name,
but that's fine.

643
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,640
First let me check.

644
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,200
No records on against this.

645
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:05,440
What?

646
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:05,920
Notice

647
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,440
Now here, you see, it
gave me no records found.

648
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,600
It means from application.
From application.

649
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,920
We are not getting any data in here.

650
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,960
We got this data from which part?

651
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,160
This data from what? Excel.

652
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:26,520
Right.

653
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,800
Because user name already exist.

654
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,440
So let me do one thing.

655
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,720
If we change the user,
we make a unique user name this time.

656
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,840
So my username would be you would see

657
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,080
my name

658
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,600
with the mirror.

659
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,560
So me

660
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,600
four, three, two, one,

661
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,240
five.

662
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,080
Let's see.

663
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,560
Look to see

664
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,440
in now.

665
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,760
Now this time. So you got a date? What?

666
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,800
I'm trying to explain this particular part
we got from Excel file.

667
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,760
Similar part
we were getting from my application.

668
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:15,480
Right now, simply what I can do is
I can do a decision in G unit.

669
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,280
We have lots of assumptions. Correct.

670
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,160
So let's provide the assertion, assert,

671
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,000
assert door

672
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,640
assert, do y because we are dealing with

673
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:30,600
two particular element
or simply assert assert equals.

674
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:34,400
I'm providing what is my expected data
and another one is

675
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,600
my next

676
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,440
radius

677
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,480
bit written output.

678
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,880
The finding is pretty far

679
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,880
from where I shot.

680
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,240
Like I said, right here. Here.

681
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:54,040
If I'm trying to find something right
which is not available in the application,

682
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,080
that's why it is giving non.

683
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,560
Well who said from exam.

684
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,640
Who said from Excel. From Excel
we got this.

685
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,920
Did you see posted once.

686
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,640
We got the later words from this one
we got from the application.

687
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,360
Read this one we got from application.

688
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,880
So this is from operating the employee.

689
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:19,320
It says user name already exist.

690
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:36,280
I'll read.

691
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:36,920
All right

692
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,440
now this time we told

693
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,800
you can be excluded from here.

694
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,840
I hope this time it will take my username
because I don't know how many users

695
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:51,000
that we needed so far in the application
we have to delete

696
00:39:51,000 --> 00:40:02,040
every week.

697
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,800
When I hope you understood to the concept
which you are implementing

698
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:14,560
but not.

699
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,080
It worked this time.

700
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,720
It worked with this time correctly

701
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,840
now. So it is asking for the employee.

702
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,160
Record this data, find

703
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,160
it's going to close now.

704
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,120
My best guess is past

705
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,640
now. So here

706
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,040
guys, can you see this
data came from application.

707
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,920
This data came from Exxon,

708
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,640
right.

709
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:49,120
Can you see both things are equal or not?

710
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,480
Many Bangladesh

711
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,000
students going

712
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,840
assertion work, right?

713
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,320
Yes, ma'am.

714
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,840
On logic one basically

715
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,560
right.

716
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,720
This is the logic
which we implemented here.

717
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,840
This logic worked

718
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:12,080
in this race.

719
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:17,200
This one part is just everyone.

720
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,840
Shall we proceed further now

721
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,440
just try to break the complete
piece of code in smaller

722
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:31,080
pieces to get it understood

723
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,360
first to the employee.

724
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,120
Fine.

725
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:37,240
Then observe
where my application is going.

726
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:42,600
Go this fine, then add another employee
before adding the employee.

727
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,800
We need to verify

728
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,520
the entry current.

729
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,520
See? See? I've used objects listed there.

730
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,720
It is also
when you can compare to this together

731
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,560
grade.

732
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,240
But we need to go over it again.

733
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,600
Find them one point.

734
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:03,320
So what I did after adding the employee
so far this part is done

735
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,600
in the time
we are getting adding the employee three

736
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:10,840
now a master here, I'm
taking an employee list option

737
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,720
but doesn't
because there is a comma in between.

738
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,960
Can you see a look of someone with here
to prevent this?

739
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,720
So instead of providing on this

740
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,840
this in double course you have to provide
commencement column space.

741
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,560
And then we look

742
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,320
now here,

743
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,760
this is the employee, by the way,
creating the employee,

744
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,760
a captured the employer based on
not getting digital value.

745
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,080
So whatever the value we have recorded
value now we can simply use this value

746
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:45,880
to search the employee because
against that employee ID, we got it in

747
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,720
the system right

748
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:54,240
now would be attitude into the system
based on this employee 88 click on such.

749
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,880
But when I clicked on search button
in the table,

750
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:00,840
it gave me all the results
of the employee's right

751
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,720
when it gave me all the results
of the employee in the search.

752
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:08,240
But then what I did, I am going
to take the data for every single tool.

753
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:12,720
I am assuming that every employee
should return.

754
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,000
How many employees?

755
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,040
Just one employee. Correct.

756
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:21,120
So I'm going to put this raw data
into the list in case if I get multiple,

757
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:21,600
I can.

758
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:25,560
Then when people think as if
I did just one, I can get just one thing.

759
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:31,200
But in this rule
I had multiple said getting in this rule.

760
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,200
I should under this drag.

761
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,480
We have so many TDD data.

762
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,840
So one by one, one by one.

763
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:40,000
I have to look through everyone
to look through every everyone.

764
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,840
I have to use one loop and
that loop is for look, which I'm using.

765
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:44,640
Right?

766
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,520
So in this look what I said builder time.

767
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:51,240
My rule is not completing just a date.

768
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:54,200
Every single loop
through every single zero the

769
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:58,320
but we look through every single rule
of the set of the rule.

770
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:03,080
I got what I got text from there
for every single

771
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:06,160
if by a zero first set find what we need

772
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,080
to get their next second segment said

773
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:14,120
get that expert said point in there time
you got them dusted right again

774
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:17,520
their data structure every single set
and then provide this fixed to me here

775
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:23,600
in this dream industrial.

776
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:28,280
Now after this, I need to get
the same kind of data from my excel by.

777
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:32,600
So now when I observe this, that will get
my application is returning data

778
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:36,560
in the employer becomes
forced, the enforcement

779
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:41,600
then will name then last I understood
the concept great when printing this data,

780
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:46,240
then I prepared
one more string to compare from the data

781
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:49,600
which I'm receiving
from my excel point in the scene,

782
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,960
or make the format
I had received from my application.

783
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:56,360
Because to compare two things together,
we need to provide them

784
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,600
in the same format.

785
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,760
One I already got from the application.

786
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,560
Another one I'm going to take from it.

787
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,600
So that's what I'm doing here.

788
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,120
Now you see in this particular point,

789
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,840
I'm going to get the data
from my excellent and the employee

790
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:13,680
and they captured what they did,
the employee, those two things together.

791
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,480
I made this particular string

792
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:19,400
now when I printed
I support these two strings are same.

793
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:22,160
And then I'm going to simply provide
assertions here.

794
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,200
Now in assumptions I'm seeing

795
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:27,920
compare these two strings in this instance
are true minus two because this passed.

796
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:34,080
And that is the reason
I got you to use, must also

797
00:45:42,920 --> 00:46:02,240
our dollars.

798
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,680
The idea

799
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,600
is this things come straight,

800
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:09,480
things
come basically with time, with practice.

801
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,480
So hopefully it won't happen overnight.

802
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:12,880
Right?

803
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:21,600
Things take time,
but you will get a job for sure.

804
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:25,480
The gold has been pushed.

805
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,600
The hedging me. That's what I'm saying.

806
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:29,160
The court has been pushed
and it's updated already

807
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,800
in the repository

808
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,200
already. You can take the code.

809
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,800
It's already been in the repository.

810
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,240
I did get of this things,
especially with batch 11

811
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:45,320
every day, every time played a computer
that could write up the value.

812
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:48,240
It is a new slide yesterday
I would predict today will

813
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,920
find days.

814
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,600
No, no.

815
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:01,400
Let me open up some really good avenues

816
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:05,160
but you show it isn't new employee from

817
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,520
this particular one

818
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:10,520
that is

819
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,880
well this is the one we got from here.

820
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,520
We created this map employee.

821
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,520
Remember their data
which we are getting from yesterday.

822
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:23,600
We need to enter the employee.

823
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:24,000
Right.

824
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:29,000
So here we got this data one by one,
we got the value from the Excel point

825
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:33,320
and we captured all this by using
our new employee object of the map.

826
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,200
And there we are using this particular
object to get the value from,

827
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:44,480
okay.

828
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:45,520
All right.

829
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:49,800
Now, once in this,

830
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:54,880
just see this was to name break
this positive look at time passing here

831
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,640
correct?

832
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:04,080
Correct.

833
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:06,440
First was let's let's complete
with your code

834
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,880
the code which you are writing
or doing anything right

835
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:12,680
I'm giving you a minute for us to complete
because I need your complete attention

836
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:13,920
on this topic.

837
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,080
The topic which I'm going to spend

838
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:20,040
take one minute of time
and complete your the store.

839
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:24,000
And when everyone is free of Olympic
do that, we'll begin

840
00:48:24,000 --> 00:49:08,520
prosecuting.

841
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,960
I hope you guys are understanding
what I'm expanding. Great

842
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:23,520
students, geniuses.

843
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:31,200
Come on.

844
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,240
When I students.

845
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:35,880
No one blinked when I said geniuses,
I see a lot of people

846
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:40,840
typing each.

847
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:50,400
You better addicted to good titles.

848
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,600
So now I got the key outward receivers

849
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:56,400
next time by roll call had the head

850
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:58,640
generally

851
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,000
next time I was called

852
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,280
but it is like one it's too it

853
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:07,920
it isn't.

854
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:11,360
Let's do it
Einstein. Let's do it like this.

855
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:14,000
I will call everyone now

856
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,040
seem Yes, it's

857
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:20,240
not for you because you're a genius.

858
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:26,800
All genius is common, though.

859
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:31,400
You did a little bit more

860
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:32,640
soon.

861
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:33,680
Got cinema.

862
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:34,640
Got it

863
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,480
Right now

864
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:44,360
I would intended you as a man in theory.

865
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:47,640
On the radio break

866
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:52,360
days,

867
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:57,840
our science was about in science
and technology.

868
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:02,320
Watson and Crick.

869
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:05,320
Minutes of same ferocity
sort of on the wall.

870
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:08,880
And in the end, Adelakun seems ingenious.

871
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:12,400
Nice.

872
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:25,200
About months when.

873
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:36,520
Okay, good.

874
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,240
It isn't a great

875
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:40,200
great.

876
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,200
What is the difference in the organic
and inorganic component

877
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:51,840
electrolytic cooling point.

878
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,560
What is remotely the reaction?

879
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:59,800
What is Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle?

880
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:00,600
It is

881
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:07,960
what is the formula?

882
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,160
Operation Magnet

883
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,240
Just getting

884
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,600
amazing year

885
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:23,600
amazing

886
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,360
in the periodic table.

887
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:28,360
I still remember from my school time.

888
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:31,080
Hydrogen, helium, lithium,

889
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:33,920
boron, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen building

890
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,400
like this,
like illegal human extinction show.

891
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:45,720
See the legal argument exception
the words is easy to say.

892
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:50,400
Should not be are not get a sequence
straight explain this problem.

893
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,640
Do what if you are presenting the key
right?

894
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:53,840
Either there is a problem

895
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:57,320
with the key that you're passing
so it is not matching with your exit

896
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:02,360
and the key you're passing in the script
or you are passing

897
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:06,760
many values from the exit by the
It is not taking any value from the

898
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:07,800
that is the problem

899
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:16,560
you push to good this

900
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:20,560
is working.

901
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,240
It's working. But this is just a warning.

902
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:32,400
It's a starting chrome driver,
not just because

903
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,760
you are using this username this way,
but it is working.

904
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:37,200
It's not reading.

905
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,360
This is just a warning.
This is not the edit.

906
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:49,080
Okay, fine.

907
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:52,440
Chilling prospect for the not so warnings.

908
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:57,720
Now see what I'm going to explain.

909
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:59,520
You see here, right?

910
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:06,320
You see here, it's so many places.

911
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:08,840
It's so many places.
We have provided this web element.

912
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:09,320
First name.

913
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:12,200
Look, in this particular script,

914
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,520
we provided this
in this particular script,

915
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:19,320
we provided this in this particular script
in multiple steps.

916
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:22,840
I have provided three days

917
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:29,640
to know what is the issue here to see.

918
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,360
I have provided the username.

919
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:39,400
Look it, and also multiple places.

920
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:43,480
Read this false name,
middle name and last name.

921
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:48,200
Look, there's also multiple places.

922
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:51,520
People write keys and so on.

923
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:56,280
Lot of lot of things
that multiple places the model.

924
00:54:56,280 --> 00:55:00,200
What if something changes
in the application?

925
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:04,160
What if they change this user name
locator, first name William

926
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:09,000
Nostrum Locator Tell me it how many places
I need to make this changes

927
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,080
all of them right?

928
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:17,000
I need to change.

929
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,360
Took a lot of maintenance work

930
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:23,040
that did a lot of maintenance work
we have to do

931
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:26,400
because we have to fix our existing script

932
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:30,120
in this case and to be able to fix that
existing script.

933
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:34,840
In this case, it's not going to work
because we have to spend unnecessarily

934
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,040
too much time on this type of things.

935
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,320
We should not do this.

936
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:41,960
We should not do this.

937
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:46,680
The definition of framework
is to simplify your work

938
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:50,680
and organized it.

939
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:54,720
And if I'm talking about organizing
the work, this is not going to work.

940
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:57,080
So let's see how we can simplify,

941
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:00,600
how we can simplify this particular part.

942
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:04,240
When we talk about simplify,
there is a concept

943
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:05,560
called

944
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:26,400
garbage object model.

945
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:30,600
What we are going to introduce know this,
we are going to introduce speed,

946
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:33,960
object model
and what exists page object model

947
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:38,680
this remember some of you guys great
because you later genius three

948
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:42,800
So some of you guys might think this
form is famous in politics.

949
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:44,920
No, that

950
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:50,840
bonded exemplars of configuration by M7
in this form with capital B capital

951
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:54,720
all capital AME is built for beach
object model.

952
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,160
This is designed by them.

953
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,720
So these are two different things.

954
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,840
Again, everybody being geniuses,

955
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:04,960
this bomb and bomb ratings and many
these are two different things.

956
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,320
Don't
get confused in between these two part.

957
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:10,320
Okay.

958
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:13,880
All right, guys.

959
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,000
Nice.

960
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:18,640
Next time, if I come across any question,

961
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:23,800
who is asking why you're talking about
and not bomb rate exhibit?

962
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:25,160
It is more than that.

963
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:26,280
Remember

964
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:30,240
what great bomb is?

965
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,600
Big object model design.

966
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,760
Pretend like this dandy.

967
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,560
Yes. Got it.

968
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,800
Getting so

969
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:41,120
little did I already gave you create

970
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:43,560
about which object built in the steps.

971
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:45,080
Right.

972
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:49,720
So what page object model isn't
bridenstine's simply it says if you have

973
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:55,200
log in screen on the application,

974
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,520
if you have dashboard screen
on the application,

975
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:04,200
if you have embroiled missed screen
on onto the application and so on.

976
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:09,480
Right now, any one thing when looking at
the current report, the code we have can

977
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:13,760
then in which classes
we have entered this username and password

978
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:18,880
inherited employs tens dashboard
steps employs dips employee just steps

979
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:23,400
log in the steps where we have date
a lot of plastic Ameritrade.

980
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:27,760
We don't know where we were in
which are all those classes.

981
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:31,560
We are past this post them look
at the last we didn't even look at us.

982
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:35,960
We may be multiple classes,
maybe been hundreds of classes.

983
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:40,680
So when we actually work
with our bulkier core in the industry

984
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:44,320
right there,
we have to handle multiple classes,

985
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:47,160
hundreds of classes,
multiple packages, right?

986
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:49,560
Ends of packages and classes.

987
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:52,640
And then if even
a single nucleotide change.

988
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:56,960
And if we go with this existing approach,
then we have to change

989
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:59,760
because of changing in one indicator,
we have to change it.

990
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,880
1000, please, which is not a good idea.

991
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:07,720
So in this case, to override this
or to get rid of this problem,

992
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:12,560
we have a concept
called speed object model design method.

993
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:17,720
So when you talk about beach object model,
what you see is what ever did you get.

994
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:21,640
That's you have to take the largest beach
people in the lagoon beach

995
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,960
make a key of it

996
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:30,760
any use this key everywhere
in log in beach in dashboard

997
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:35,560
Beach in employee
is beach in an employee beach.

998
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:38,680
So now you are using the same everywhere.

999
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:43,040
And next time when you are located team,
you don't need to change it.

1000
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:46,840
Hundreds of places
just change it in one place in the log

1001
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:49,760
beach
and everything will be fixed automatically

1002
00:59:51,000 --> 01:00:00,240
in dispute.

1003
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:04,640
So now in one place we need to change
and then things will automatically

1004
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:08,880
get completed every minute because
now we are not passing the locator.

1005
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:12,400
We are passing the key of the locator
between based on the basis

1006
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:17,280
and it will link
all the GIS link to the same locator

1007
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:21,560
which is available at one place
in my class right now.

1008
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:24,360
Let's do it. Let's see one by one.

1009
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:26,920
Similarly for all of them,
force them with a name.

1010
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:29,760
Last name. Right. Go on to Employee beach.

1011
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,760
We want to add employee Beach in this bid

1012
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:35,960
just for this post name
we didn't name last name locator.

1013
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:39,840
Make a key of this
look at this and the provided indentation

1014
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:43,080
for beach employee list
beach log in beach every minute.

1015
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:44,160
Correct

1016
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:47,720
understood functions

1017
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:52,040
related to what
Beach locators related to one beach

1018
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:55,320
should be available
inside that beach only.

1019
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:57,960
And from there we can call these locators.

1020
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,960
We can call this functions, right?

1021
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:02,880
So that's how we can simplify the code
using beach

1022
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:08,920
object model design in the studio.

1023
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:14,840
In the studio or not,
let's first implement

1024
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,560
most beach great that I would show you
and then you will get more idea about see,

1025
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:23,600
I'm going to perform right here

1026
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:27,360
on the Java page because the beach is also
part of my class.

1027
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:29,520
In class is nothing but my Java.

1028
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:33,800
So here I'm going to create in my Java
new package.

1029
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:38,880
In the package
name is Page's package name is Page's.

1030
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:39,800
Right?

1031
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:45,480
And inside this pages,
the first one I will create and is

1032
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:49,200
login page Beach

1033
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:52,200
is what is the first screen

1034
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:55,680
You can You can consider this screen
from the steps.

1035
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:58,200
Also can you see log in two steps
for log in page.

1036
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:02,320
So here I'm going to prevent
logging beach.

1037
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:05,960
This is my plus and I'll see the advantage
of using log in page.

1038
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:09,000
You see what I'm going to do

1039
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
first?

1040
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,720
First I see in my log in two steps

1041
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:17,400
in my log
in, can you see and providing username

1042
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:22,160
and password here like this.

1043
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:23,960
Yes, yes, yes, please watch this.

1044
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:26,840
Watch. You will get everything days
after the class.

1045
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:27,720
You can track these guys.

1046
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:29,160
This is something very important.

1047
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:29,920
Please.

1048
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:32,240
Trying to understand what I'm explaining.

1049
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:32,880
Can you see here?

1050
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,880
I'm passing the username. Right.

1051
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:37,480
Is someone here also passing the username?

1052
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:38,040
Right?

1053
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:39,120
Multiple places.

1054
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:41,280
I'm passing this username here also.

1055
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:44,280
So even if there is a change
in the use of new rule,

1056
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:47,640
I need to change in this small
piece of coded for places.

1057
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:49,120
Right.

1058
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:51,640
And this is not appropriate approach.

1059
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,520
So what is the alternate?

1060
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,640
Don't let me show you

1061
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:58,680
in this nugget beach right in this log in.

1062
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:00,000
Did you play Google?

1063
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,360
I will write you delete

1064
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:05,200
link like everyone knows

1065
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,680
why the user did it find my

1066
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:13,800
everyone knows you don't want me.

1067
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:16,440
We used way to define the locator.

1068
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:19,680
So my locator is available
for one with I.D..

1069
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:21,840
I might look for the ids D

1070
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:25,160
deeds, the user name.

1071
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:25,880
Right.

1072
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:29,320
And here I'm
going to provide my group element as the

1073
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,840
user group.

1074
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:36,800
And then I provided it very limited user
name group.

1075
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:39,080
I made it public.

1076
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:40,320
Why I made it public.

1077
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:41,560
Supposed to

1078
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:47,120
Why I made it public
because I want to use this particular

1079
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:51,840
key user name across the
my entire project.

1080
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:52,320
Right?

1081
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:57,440
So to access it across my entire project,
I have to use this key as a public,

1082
01:03:58,080 --> 01:03:59,240
as a public key.

1083
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:03,280
So this user name is available
as a publicly everywhere,

1084
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:06,560
correct? Correct.

1085
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:10,640
Grace Now let me take the same thing
for password also.

1086
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:14,000
So he is listed as

1087
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:16,760
password field

1088
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:19,760
and this should be my

1089
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:24,760
it should be my t

1090
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:26,040
password.

1091
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:29,880
Similarly, this one should be my VPN

1092
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,240
login. So I'm writing here.

1093
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:38,720
This should be my log.

1094
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:40,320
In this

1095
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:43,560
case.

1096
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:47,440
Ah, this nugget is going to tell me

1097
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:49,800
is that any of the look that we got from

1098
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:53,160
the logging feature, is it
any of the look at the record

1099
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:55,920
from the log page

1100
01:04:58,200 --> 01:04:58,920
error message?

1101
01:04:58,920 --> 01:04:59,240
Correct.

1102
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:01,800
Cannibalism
with the idea of the data message based

1103
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:05,440
it, we put it here

1104
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:09,120
for the error message. So

1105
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,840
I had a message

1106
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:14,960
and someone please provide me

1107
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:19,160
the end of the message.

1108
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:22,760
I think this was sent such
please correct me if I'm wrong.

1109
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:29,320
Is this correct?

1110
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:30,520
Screams

1111
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:33,720
guys, please don't type again.

1112
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:35,640
I'm saying please don't be because here

1113
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:40,320
for you

1114
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:46,880
then we can not answer.

1115
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:49,160
Yes, Nicole.
That's what I'm saying. Don't they?

1116
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:53,480
Don't I just see what I'm going to try
and respond to it.

1117
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:57,160
Try to be in the communication with the
the conversation.

1118
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:00,160
Can we use any locator here?

1119
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:01,840
City These are the locators.

1120
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:05,520
Can you see these are the locators.

1121
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:08,200
We are to use this locators
wherever we need them.

1122
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:09,120
Okay?

1123
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:10,920
Whenever we need them, we will use them.

1124
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:13,800
Fine. So first things first.

1125
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:19,160
Remember when we talk about Beach
object more do get better, right?

1126
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:23,040
We have to initialize all the elements
straight.

1127
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:26,400
All the elements
which we have in this particular beach,

1128
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:28,800
in this particular class.

1129
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:31,400
And to do this
whenever we want to do this, I mean,

1130
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:36,240
instead of maybe use textbook,
if we use it, we can use a lot of things.

1131
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,640
Yes, we can use a lot
of things that don't really

1132
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:42,960
we can use a lot of things already.

1133
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:44,040
You can use export.

1134
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:48,600
You can use class name I.D., name,
trade, text, anything you can use

1135
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:51,960
because everyone is comfortable
with this part.

1136
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:54,120
That's why
I'm thinking from students perspective.

1137
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:57,720
So now, guys, remember first

1138
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:02,560
to use all these elements, grade first,
we have to initialize this elements.

1139
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:03,760
What we have to do.

1140
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:06,240
First, we have to initialize this element.

1141
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:08,360
So now I know.

1142
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:11,880
Just remember
the definition of constructor. Why?

1143
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:14,480
Because constructor we generally use

1144
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:19,320
when initialize the object right?

1145
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:22,520
When we actually create the object
constructor

1146
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:25,800
is directly called
automatically Constructor call.

1147
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,960
We need constructor
to pass all of these things.

1148
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:30,160
Great days.

1149
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:33,200
Remember, if there is no default

1150
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:36,120
constructor we are going to write user
defined constructor.

1151
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:36,840
Got it.

1152
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:38,880
And what is the definition of constructor?

1153
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:43,040
Constructor is its
theme is constructed having the same name

1154
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:45,480
as the class name,
but it looks like a method.

1155
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:48,240
Then this is a definition of constructor.

1156
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:49,640
Not so.

1157
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:50,880
Let me later one constructor.

1158
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:52,840
I don't know. This
constructor I'm asking you

1159
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:56,280
is naming a statement

1160
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:00,160
as the last but looks like a method.

1161
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:03,400
This is a definition of constructor.

1162
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:04,440
It's going to.

1163
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:09,400
This is correct constructor or not.

1164
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:13,040
So now I'm going to make this constructor
also public

1165
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:16,560
and I'm making this public

1166
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:20,160
by making this because I would use it
everywhere again, right?

1167
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:22,200
If I make it private.

1168
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:23,960
That is one of the question they ask.

1169
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:26,080
Where did you used
constructor in your project?

1170
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:28,680
So we apply the same thing
we do. Grid Yes.

1171
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:30,000
Yes. Correct.

1172
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,360
So this is the constructor
we are using to initialize

1173
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:37,520
the objects to initialize
all the elements of the beachfront.

1174
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:40,160
So Beach complete names for Logic Beach
we have one beach.

1175
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:41,080
Great.

1176
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:43,720
For this
would be a one beach for an employee.

1177
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:46,240
The one beach for employees
that we have one beach.

1178
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:49,920
So when we have multiple pages
in multiple classes.

1179
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:53,440
We call this beach country
and a repeat of the beach

1180
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:57,160
and we have multiple elements
to initialize this elements.

1181
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:58,520
We need constructor.

1182
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:05,200
In that constructor, we're using.

1183
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:05,760
Understood.

1184
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:09,240
Now see now see.

1185
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:10,280
Very simple code.

1186
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:12,920
I'm going to write for State.

1187
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:20,560
Tell me the is where we have my drivers.

1188
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,680
We need a lot of things
for our common methods.

1189
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:25,480
So states are common
methods supposed to have

1190
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:33,640
common methods.

1191
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:36,320
And now I'm going to write inside this

1192
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:44,200
inside this page again.

1193
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:46,920
You see the first one which tree

1194
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:49,000
I'm seeing dark

1195
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,400
initialize element's initialize elements.

1196
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:54,040
It is asking for two things here.

1197
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:56,560
See it is asking for web driver. First,

1198
01:09:57,680 --> 01:10:00,360
it is asking for web drivers based to me.

1199
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:07,680
Do we need to define another web here?

1200
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:10,120
Or we can simply take the instance
of that web driver.

1201
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:15,800
What we have from the common methods.

1202
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:17,800
We can take the driver
from my commonwealth.

1203
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:20,400
It's good to see it is connected and then

1204
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:24,240
and then it is asking for not multiclass
objects.

1205
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:26,920
So I'm defining it. Do this. Why?

1206
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:31,800
Because I'm going to provide
which page this particular page.

1207
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:35,400
So I'm going to initialize the elements,
this page.

1208
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:39,760
That's why I brought this keyword
here, read this keyword here

1209
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:44,640
and the driver I'm taking from
with the driver I'm taking from Common.

1210
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:48,720
Understood.

1211
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:53,720
If you don't want to take this common
methods from here, don't make it directly.

1212
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:58,240
You have to write from here the code
for your common methods for driver.

1213
01:10:58,240 --> 01:10:59,320
This is also you can do.

1214
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:02,560
Can you see things here?

1215
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:04,240
Can you see?

1216
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:06,440
There it is also you can do directly.

1217
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:10,560
But then you will not be able
to use the properties of common methods

1218
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:12,000
throughout your class.

1219
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,120
So it is always good to follow the concept

1220
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:19,720
of the concept of inheritance
and instead of this,

1221
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:23,440
to simply call the driver
using extrinsic key

1222
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:28,240
word in common methods.

1223
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:30,840
So for any question in this

1224
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:37,800
new question,

1225
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:44,200
everyone, shall

1226
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:48,080
you proceed further?

1227
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:52,520
This is the first speech
we have created right now.

1228
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:54,360
See what I'm going to do.

1229
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:55,320
Very simple thing.

1230
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:58,280
What I'm going to do now,
I will go in with this.

1231
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:01,040
So in my log, in two steps, I will go.

1232
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:03,880
I saw here I'm using username password

1233
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:07,200
here, I'm using this username.

1234
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:08,560
Let me do one thing this time.

1235
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:12,600
See, I'm going to create the
object of my logging, which

1236
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:14,160
at the

1237
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:17,240
moment
I create the object of my login page.

1238
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:19,920
My constructor is called automatically
or not the me

1239
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:23,040
any days.

1240
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:27,080
My constructor
is called automatically or not.

1241
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:30,720
So now using this object
when I provide daughter,

1242
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:33,440
it is giving me username and password.

1243
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:35,360
We log important error message everything.

1244
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:37,880
Can you see?

1245
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:39,680
Can you see this crazy

1246
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:47,680
right now?

1247
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:53,080
Provide this username read
this username to dark circles

1248
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:56,760
and here provide your send key straight.

1249
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:59,280
So whatever the data you have
for the username. Right.

1250
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:02,480
So data we are providing,
we are providing from

1251
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,240
configurator.

1252
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:14,720
Don't forget property
value in the vendor is providing a user.

1253
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:19,600
Now tell me guys,
do we need these two lines then?

1254
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:21,920
Do we need this web element?

1255
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:24,720
Do we need this code?

1256
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:25,600
We don't need it.

1257
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:27,560
Not anymore.

1258
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:30,880
Read the same thing
we can do with the password.

1259
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:34,080
So this line on with the log in,

1260
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:37,320
not the password field not is.

1261
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:41,520
So again,
we don't need this code as we can now

1262
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:47,120
see my code restricted to just two steps.

1263
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:55,440
Can you see
my code is restricted to just two steps.

1264
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:58,240
Similarly here, see here
what I'm going to do.

1265
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:01,200
Take this log in breach again.

1266
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:01,760
Great.

1267
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,200
Because I defined this object
inside this particular step.

1268
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:08,400
So it is not applicable to business.
Great.

1269
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:11,120
I have to create another object here.

1270
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:14,040
And this time I'm writing again.

1271
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:18,080
Don't log in and simply click on this one.

1272
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:22,840
And again,
we don't need this web element from here.

1273
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:26,120
Correct? Is this correct?

1274
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:35,280
Guys?

1275
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:37,680
Similarly, I want to use.

1276
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:40,400
Right. For example,
take this logging page from here.

1277
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:42,600
Go to this a step.

1278
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:44,680
Also find in this step.

1279
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:49,040
Also use this log in word
change everywhere.

1280
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:52,560
Whenever you are getting this user name
and provide this

1281
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:56,760
similarly here also go right logging

1282
01:14:57,120 --> 01:15:00,000
password, field and incentives trade

1283
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:05,440
Similarly
go for your logging door on door.

1284
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:07,840
Don't click great days.

1285
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:10,120
So now see, we don't need this amendment.

1286
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:11,720
We don't need this element.

1287
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:13,480
We don't family.

1288
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:16,480
And just in make what is working

1289
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:19,640
can be a function by and replace in

1290
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:22,880
we use the function find

1291
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:26,280
we can do that
but just to show everyone right.

1292
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:28,560
It is a quick quick one.
It is a quick one.

1293
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:32,400
But if I do this,
people will not understand.

1294
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:33,280
That's fine. I'm going.

1295
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,680
This is step by step approach.

1296
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:39,240
Similarly here
raid for a solutions right this time.

1297
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:43,200
See, I'm getting this error message
from here from this web element.

1298
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:48,240
I don't want this web element anymore
because I have this part in my

1299
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:50,280
in my login page.

1300
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:52,720
So let's take it from logging based
error message.

1301
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:54,200
I got this from there.

1302
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:57,360
So this time same locator works
for my particular class.

1303
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:01,680
Now see how the linking to get check
right click on this username

1304
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:05,200
to go do declaration.

1305
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:08,080
It is taking you to this place,

1306
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:08,520
right?

1307
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:11,640
It is linked with this particular key
that you avoided

1308
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:14,320
here in the store.

1309
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:21,120
Indisputably one.

1310
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:24,680
So now you see
because of using this particular log in

1311
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,920
if I go in, my log in is steps right
in my log in, two steps.

1312
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:32,280
If I go and let me change this
to one more place here

1313
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:37,240
and providing logging page
instead of these logging door

1314
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:41,760
username rates or don't need this part.

1315
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:45,960
Similarly, we don't need this,
but we can simply log in

1316
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:51,240
password field, find

1317
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:56,880
and it work right now.

1318
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:59,160
See it is asking for dashboard.

1319
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:04,760
So tell me nice to do something on
dashboard which class we need to create.

1320
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:07,400
I don't want this locator here no more.

1321
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:10,680
Look in any of the class,
no more looking down the steps.

1322
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:13,440
Your locators, your functions.

1323
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:14,480
We have to clear dashboard

1324
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:19,680
which so unlock does on functions
when reading enough classes in our pages.

1325
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:20,560
Fine.

1326
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:24,400
So let me right
click in, Create another class bottom line

1327
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:27,880
bottom on baseboard page.

1328
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:30,880
When my Facebook page

1329
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:33,800
tried again, Extents

1330
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:38,080
extends to common methods

1331
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:39,160
release

1332
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:42,120
right to extend common methods
we all normally would

1333
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:45,600
then enter it find.

1334
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:46,680
But again

1335
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:50,280
here we need to provide the value.

1336
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:52,960
Fine. So let's provide the value.

1337
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:53,640
So what?

1338
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:56,880
All are
the things I see on my dashboard page?

1339
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:00,000
The first thing is the welcome message,
which we would have like.

1340
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:03,800
So let me take this as I the equals

1341
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:07,160
value of this I can find here.

1342
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:11,960
It says Welcome one.

1343
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:16,320
So let's take this welcome here
and then I'm going to write public

1344
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:19,280
places.

1345
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:22,520
Welcome message

1346
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:23,840
function.

1347
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:26,720
What is the constructor Public

1348
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,960
Dashboard page.

1349
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:32,840
Public dashboard page.

1350
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:37,160
Then Beechwood did not initialize
and the means driver

1351
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:39,800
command this

1352
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:43,480
hardware guys

1353
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:52,760
students. Now

1354
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:56,720
see if I go in my log instance.

1355
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:58,000
I don't need this look at.

1356
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,680
I will simply need to my dashboard page

1357
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:03,840
but I'm

1358
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:05,600
spending

1359
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:08,080
dashboard page.

1360
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:10,920
Create the object for this one.

1361
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:15,280
Right
and simply instead of using this part.

1362
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:19,680
Right,
this park web element simply right here

1363
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:22,560
called dash

1364
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:26,120
dot welcome message,

1365
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:32,000
welcome message is displayed
and we don't need this element anymore.

1366
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,160
So now what is big is to extend

1367
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:38,360
or to call from to extend to extend.

1368
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:39,480
I will explain you why.

1369
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:41,480
BLITZER
Because when you put it in the constructor

1370
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:44,000
right, you're making the scope
limited, right?

1371
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:45,720
You're making the scope limited.

1372
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:46,320
I will tell you,

1373
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:50,000
if we extend that throughout the class,
how can you use those properties?

1374
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:52,560
You will understand that part
one actually explained

1375
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:55,800
because in common metrics,
we are going to add a lot of things,

1376
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:58,560
right,
So that you will understand this concept.

1377
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:00,080
Fine, guys.

1378
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:04,440
So now, now, whatever
the things we did for this small book,

1379
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:10,000
which is just one log in step three,
we create a dashboard page in log in which

1380
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:13,960
no next time,
next time when your user make changes,

1381
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:16,760
when your password changes,
when you log in,

1382
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:20,520
look at our changes dashboard changes.

1383
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:22,840
It should extend common methods. Class,
correct?

1384
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:25,280
Correct. Correct. Exactly.

1385
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:27,120
I will.

1386
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:28,200
I will tell you why.

1387
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:32,280
Rate in this legacy rate
in this next to classes on weekends

1388
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:34,320
and this class, it will make more

1389
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:38,760
clear for you,
why do we need to do this one?

1390
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:40,280
So now you see this.

1391
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:43,960
If if this time my user name
look bigger change password.

1392
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:45,600
Look it again. 2200.

1393
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:46,640
This is

1394
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:52,960
how many place has been in the change Now

1395
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:57,280
just going to one place
Jason located here.

1396
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:59,440
Right. Just one place. Change it here.

1397
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:03,320
And this key is applicable to every base
and no one look at it is going to work

1398
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:04,920
for all the classes.

1399
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:07,280
So no more maintenance.

1400
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:08,280
No more maintenance.

1401
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:11,520
Date You'll come across an issue
with the look at the prime Go ahead

1402
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:14,520
candidate
one place and will fix all of your screwed

1403
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:17,520
in dispute.

1404
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:19,080
This part everyone

1405
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:37,800
so for any questions Student

1406
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:44,920
So now in Dashboard
Beach in Dashboard page,

1407
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:47,600
we have a couple of more indicators
virtually obtained.

1408
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:49,520
First, let's complete the speech.

1409
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:53,400
Now, if you seen the dashboard steps read
here, we got

1410
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:57,600
we got this data in the list of relevant
support for this.

1411
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:01,320
We got this date also correct.

1412
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,600
So now first, take this look at here.

1413
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:07,720
Right. So I'm going to write this bar

1414
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:11,760
list of elements of our list,
what I have to write,

1415
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:16,000
public public

1416
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:19,200
list of verbatim.

1417
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:22,560
So I need this for

1418
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:24,960
dashboard steps.

1419
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:26,880
And what is the locator?

1420
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:29,520
So the locator I can take from here only

1421
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:32,600
it is via explanatory.

1422
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:36,960
So let me take this export
and put it here.

1423
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:40,240
So this would be my city

1424
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:44,040
if I know that I'm using
x button instead of your I

1425
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:53,080
is this one.

1426
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:54,360
Nice.

1427
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:57,600
See going to dashboard page here.

1428
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:01,920
Create the object to find next object for

1429
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:09,760
dashboard page is equals to the new

1430
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:15,520
ish for beach and this time
we don't need this particular one.

1431
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:17,760
They should perhaps read

1432
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:20,840
okay one.

1433
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:23,080
So we were taking this from here.

1434
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:26,320
So this painting Dash done this book

1435
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:31,200
kind, we provided this.

1436
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:32,320
We don't need this.

1437
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:35,800
Looking at the stored

1438
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:39,080
industrial we want
we don't need this locator anymore.

1439
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:41,920
We directly prevented this
from our dashboard based. It's

1440
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:52,320
now Now, if I go to the application

1441
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:56,440
you see on this dashboard page,
we have the option employee list.

1442
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:57,600
Option right.

1443
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:00,960
And employee button, all these options
I want page or not

1444
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:06,120
then me this option employee list,
everything is available in my baseboard.

1445
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:10,840
So let's take this three also because
we know we will be using employee list

1446
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:15,720
and we are using actually an employee
employee list and option point.

1447
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:20,000
Do we have the locators for this
three B option employee list?

1448
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:20,400
And this

1449
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:26,840
days,

1450
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:31,440
do we have to look for option?

1451
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:34,480
Or if we were to

1452
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:35,480
invoke

1453
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:39,480
this term?

1454
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:41,480
Yes, we do have.

1455
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:43,960
So let's take those locators from it.

1456
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:44,680
Employee steps.

1457
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:46,920
If I go, let me check.

1458
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:49,320
We have BIM option, right?

1459
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:51,600
So let's take this 80 for the option here.

1460
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:55,520
If I copied this 80 and if I come here

1461
01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:58,400
BIM option, fine.

1462
01:24:58,400 --> 01:24:59,360
There you go.

1463
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:03,080
Similarly for an employee.

1464
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:07,000
So for an employee, this is the ID

1465
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:12,480
copy this party and and paste it here.

1466
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:16,200
Fine. And the last one is employee list.

1467
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:20,240
So this employee list option
we got here in the verification part.

1468
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:22,800
Right. Let's see the employee list.

1469
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:26,400
We just clicked on this employee list
in employment

1470
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:27,600
and find

1471
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:33,240
employee list.

1472
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:34,320
There you go.

1473
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:37,000
This is the employee list option. Fine.

1474
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:39,480
So copy this employee list.

1475
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:44,400
Now come to Dashboard
Beach and simply add this employee list is

1476
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:49,560
now again what we need to do.

1477
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:50,800
Go wherever we are.

1478
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:54,240
Finding this particular part right

1479
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:56,680
Whenever we are calling rate and,
we will change them.

1480
01:25:57,720 --> 01:26:01,320
So after the break, right after the break,
we will change all this.

1481
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:04,320
Locators in this class, this yellow.

1482
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:07,360
I knew, I knew it.

1483
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:10,880
All right.

1484
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:13,360
So just thermometers, right?

1485
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:15,440
And then we will be on break.

1486
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:18,360
But so far, whatever the things we are
doing, you guys understood it or not?

1487
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:21,400
Tell me this is the page
object model design concept design

1488
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:29,480
in which we are using.

1489
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:30,080
It's cool.

1490
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:34,560
It's actually good and a lot of cool
things on the we like, guys are great.

1491
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:36,560
We're going to reduce the concept now.

1492
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:40,560
We are going to reduce
the number of lines of code, right?

1493
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:44,360
We will use less number of lines
and we utilized and called

1494
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:46,560
reusability concepts to the fullest.

1495
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:49,320
We are going to implement in the
framework.

1496
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:54,880
All right, guys,

1497
01:26:56,240 --> 01:26:59,440
so far, any questions?

1498
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:03,120
I'm not going to push the code as of now
because code is in between.

1499
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:05,280
Right. It's not a complete code.

1500
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:08,040
So that's why I'm not going to push it
right after the class.

1501
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:11,320
I will push the code. So don't ask

1502
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:13,640
the code, which was supposed to be pushed.

1503
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:15,080
I already pushed.

1504
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:17,520
This code is incomplete.
That's why I'm not pushing.

1505
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:21,040
It is because we need to fix
all the biggest one.

1506
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:39,920
Okay.

1507
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:43,920
Already so needed to take a break
and you push, push, push, push.

1508
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:45,360
You pushed four times.

1509
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:49,080
No, no, no, no.

1510
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:52,880
We should start with this concept
that if someone got it correct,

1511
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:55,480
we should start with the concept
from the scratch.

1512
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:56,880
I will tell you.

1513
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:59,360
I will tell you how to identify
the two technologies.

1514
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:05,400
Would you like to change?

1515
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:06,400
I will change.

1516
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:12,720
I would change the.

1517
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:14,560
Oh, break for 15 minutes, guys.

1518
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:17,600
Classic. 15 minutes looking for 10 minutes

1519
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:20,680
would be

1520
01:28:20,680 --> 01:28:23,640
okay, let's take a break for 15 minutes
and we'll connect up on that.

1521
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:26,160
Let me start the recording just fine.

1522
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:29,160
So now this is my dashboard page.

1523
01:28:29,160 --> 01:28:33,400
If I click on bim right,
then BIM is not going to let me anywhere.

1524
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:35,920
It is still on their dashboard page.

1525
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:38,640
So I got all this locators in it,

1526
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:41,280
put them in their dashboard.

1527
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:42,720
So there you go.

1528
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:43,920
This is what I have it.

1529
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:46,120
Should it open a different window?

1530
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:47,280
So yes, correct.

1531
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:51,120
I mean, it means more simply that
the screen is going to be application.

1532
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:54,960
We consider them as a pages.

1533
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:56,080
If you don't have any screen,

1534
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:58,200
the application will not consider
this is a page.

1535
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:04,680
Alright.

1536
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:06,480
All right.

1537
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:08,720
So now, now let's do one thing. Great.

1538
01:29:09,080 --> 01:29:10,520
Let's quickly change.

1539
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:13,280
We click change all of this options
that it would we have used.

1540
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:17,480
So first let's go to employee search rate.

1541
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:21,000
In employee search, we got employee list

1542
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:25,440
in module rate.

1543
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:28,560
This is the first one more option,
so we need to change it.

1544
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:32,480
So PIM option is available
in which particular based in which class

1545
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:34,080
we have option

1546
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:36,480
students

1547
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:39,680
in they should be trained.

1548
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:42,480
So let me clear our dashboard
beach. Right.

1549
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:45,720
So let me just take this new

1550
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:47,880
dashboard page and here

1551
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,520
this dash dark

1552
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:56,000
emotion I need to click

1553
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:59,760
so I don't need this particular looking.

1554
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:02,120
Do I have employee list also in addition,
which

1555
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:05,880
let's just

1556
01:30:08,680 --> 01:30:09,280
employee list

1557
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:12,360
also we have on the page or not.

1558
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:14,160
Yes we do have

1559
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:17,000
So now see just one object creation.

1560
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:17,560
Right.

1561
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:20,400
And both
the elements are coming from that.

1562
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:25,960
They should be similarly
come here train for search 80.

1563
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:30,440
So now tell me, guys, for searching the ID
grade for getting this particular value.

1564
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:33,360
Do I need to create another page
or dashboard? We just point

1565
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:48,320
is, do I need
to create another page of this dashboard?

1566
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:52,280
Biggest point
for this search employer to look again?

1567
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:53,280
New page. Right.

1568
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:55,560
Christine,
How is it possible they're doing?

1569
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:58,160
They should be.
They can read the data for an employee.

1570
01:30:58,440 --> 01:31:00,320
We can't do this right.

1571
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:02,520
We need to create a new page.

1572
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:05,240
So my new page would be

1573
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:06,600
used according to the screen.

1574
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:13,240
So what is the name of my page?

1575
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:15,440
New employee.

1576
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:20,720
Page A new employee page not eliminated.

1577
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:29,840
Then whenever we create a new page,
what is the first thing we do?

1578
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:33,520
It stinks.

1579
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:35,160
Common methods.

1580
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:37,800
And then we provide all the locators.

1581
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:44,160
So let me go to an employee page post.

1582
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:46,520
Tell me, what are the locators we need?

1583
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:49,320
First name, middle name,
last name, employee

1584
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:53,480
photograph create log in user confirm
password.

1585
01:31:53,480 --> 01:31:55,840
Say button. We need all these.

1586
01:31:57,080 --> 01:31:57,520
We need all.

1587
01:31:57,520 --> 01:31:57,960
These are not.

1588
01:31:57,960 --> 01:31:58,680
Tell me

1589
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:04,600
so let's add them quickly.

1590
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:05,600
Expand them quickly.

1591
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:08,320
Guys, this is not something
which is rocket science.

1592
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:11,080
It really is a thing I'm doing.

1593
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:12,080
We already have this.

1594
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:18,240
No, because I'm
just putting it in my page.

1595
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:20,280
So the name would be my first.

1596
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:22,200
I will take a look at

1597
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:32,240
and this would be mine

1598
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:33,680
to name

1599
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:36,960
and this would be mine

1600
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:39,160
last name.

1601
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:42,120
This would be my employee already

1602
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:46,320
made locator and the employer did.

1603
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:47,960
This would be mine

1604
01:32:48,680 --> 01:32:50,760
checkbox right

1605
01:32:52,440 --> 01:32:56,520
then this would be mine.

1606
01:32:56,520 --> 01:32:57,160
Okay.

1607
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:01,560
After photograph I need for

1608
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:06,440
to create the user name.

1609
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:10,320
Is it user name after create username.

1610
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:19,120
I need your password

1611
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:23,760
and then my new book password.

1612
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:28,680
And another one I need is perseverance.

1613
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:30,080
So this would be mine.

1614
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:39,240
See, that is correct.

1615
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:42,160
Let's change. Let's change this. Keys.

1616
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:44,880
So this keys I can find here.

1617
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:47,000
I can find this keys of

1618
01:33:49,480 --> 01:33:52,160
the first name is this one.

1619
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:55,920
We take this post to.

1620
01:33:55,920 --> 01:34:01,560
Actually, I'm on the same page.

1621
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:02,280
Right?

1622
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:04,800
Why we are not creating
the bin would be more option.

1623
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:07,320
That's what human nature

1624
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:11,520
later said.

1625
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:15,360
Be this related to the screen
in the application.

1626
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:23,040
Do we have any screen bin?

1627
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:26,880
This is just an option
or it is a complete script.

1628
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:28,360
Didn't

1629
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:30,800
vet video.

1630
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:33,400
See, this is a different page.
That's what I'm asking.

1631
01:34:33,720 --> 01:34:36,200
You see, when I click on beam,

1632
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:39,520
when I click on beam,
it is just an option which is me.

1633
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:42,600
This option here,
can you see just Mozilla on the beam?

1634
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:45,800
When you click on beam, it is providing
you see

1635
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:51,480
it is providing your employee information
which is employee list can you see so

1636
01:34:51,480 --> 01:34:55,560
begins again redirecting you to employee
list and not on speech.

1637
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,680
If I click on employee see number

1638
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:02,800
two is taking you to an employee page,
but you are clicking one beam.

1639
01:35:03,080 --> 01:35:05,160
It is taking you to employees to page.

1640
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:07,560
That is no page for

1641
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:18,400
industrial nation.

1642
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:19,720
That is

1643
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:26,040
no father.

1644
01:35:26,040 --> 01:35:29,600
No, we can't do this
because we have to initialize all of them

1645
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:32,480
and to initialize
after that we have to cleared the object.

1646
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:34,960
So I have this optional. Absolutely.

1647
01:35:35,240 --> 01:35:38,320
I will give you the solutions, but let

1648
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:41,320
first, once we are done,
once we are done with this thing,

1649
01:35:41,320 --> 01:35:42,800
then I give you the solution.

1650
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:46,040
How we can get rid of this
creating multiple objects there.

1651
01:35:47,080 --> 01:35:49,200
Okay, so it is in my book.

1652
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:51,960
Hopefully the minimum sort of a beat
would just be

1653
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:56,440
just like config.

1654
01:35:56,440 --> 01:35:57,600
That's what I'm saying.

1655
01:35:57,600 --> 01:35:58,520
Aisha Why?

1656
01:35:58,520 --> 01:36:01,320
You're not going to spend me
when we click on beam.

1657
01:36:01,320 --> 01:36:04,600
Can you see this
employee list is highlighted?

1658
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:07,640
What does it mean
when you click on payment is taking you

1659
01:36:07,640 --> 01:36:11,840
to employee list page?

1660
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:13,680
This is employee list page on me.

1661
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:15,440
What is this?

1662
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:18,560
This is an employee list page.

1663
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:21,000
Raise.

1664
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,400
Let me show you.
Let me show you the floor again.

1665
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:24,840
Let me show you the floor.

1666
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:26,920
You are on dashboard page.

1667
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:28,880
So this is their dashboard, right?

1668
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:32,080
You'll see everything on dashboard
when you click on beam, bitch.

1669
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:36,960
When you click on Beam page,
it is taking you to employees to page.

1670
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:38,120
This is employees to page.

1671
01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:41,560
Well, it's been page to me.

1672
01:36:41,560 --> 01:36:42,880
You need to

1673
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:48,640
based on page.

1674
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:49,920
And when you're talking about this,

1675
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:53,760
what options you're getting the support
options only dashboard which see,

1676
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:57,520
when I go in this work page,
I simply do this mouse over on

1677
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:01,600
you see, I'm getting this for options.

1678
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:07,520
So this what options doesn't
we don't be a beach.

1679
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:11,160
And now when you click on beam,
it is taking you to employee list page.

1680
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:12,720
See, employee needs to be

1681
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:14,480
read.

1682
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:16,600
You'll get understood

1683
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:27,120
cutting

1684
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:30,040
cutting currently
do not have any page such just beam.

1685
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:31,560
That's way.

1686
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:34,320
All right so now let me quickly add

1687
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:37,400
all of their data from your boss to me

1688
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:41,040
and then put they just for

1689
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:43,120
last to name

1690
01:37:45,720 --> 01:37:46,360
and put as

1691
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:53,280
many.

1692
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:55,120
This is for button.

1693
01:37:55,120 --> 01:37:56,880
So let me change your privacy.

1694
01:37:56,880 --> 01:38:02,760
Also,

1695
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:09,800
this is for many.

1696
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:11,720
This is going we

1697
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:14,840
now we need for employee ideas, but

1698
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:19,200
I will point out here

1699
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:20,800
for employee I.D.

1700
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:23,280
this is the employee. A client is fine.

1701
01:38:24,200 --> 01:38:25,640
Just take it

1702
01:38:28,520 --> 01:38:31,960
for duty and then for checkbox.

1703
01:38:31,960 --> 01:38:34,760
So this is for checkbox

1704
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:38,640
and I will put this checkbox
here and photograph.

1705
01:38:40,120 --> 01:38:42,720
So this is 34 books, but I you put

1706
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,840
complete and

1707
01:38:46,120 --> 01:38:51,360
pasted here then for username.

1708
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:53,600
So this would be the key for my username

1709
01:38:56,080 --> 01:39:00,080
and then for password.

1710
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:02,160
So this would be the key for my

1711
01:39:03,240 --> 01:39:03,760
password.

1712
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:07,040
Create password first
and then for password.

1713
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:12,720
So this is the key for my password.

1714
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:15,120
Now I got all this looking there. See it?

1715
01:39:15,120 --> 01:39:16,440
Can you see guys?

1716
01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:17,240
I got all this.

1717
01:39:17,240 --> 01:39:18,360
Look, here's

1718
01:39:20,680 --> 01:39:23,320
after this one step remaining.

1719
01:39:23,320 --> 01:39:27,600
What is that?

1720
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:28,080
What is that?

1721
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:30,320
There is one step too many

1722
01:39:30,320 --> 01:39:33,680
instructor blades of public

1723
01:39:33,680 --> 01:39:36,200
and new employee page.

1724
01:39:36,200 --> 01:39:39,680
This is the construct that was deployed
called page three

1725
01:39:40,280 --> 01:39:43,200
or initialize element Driver.

1726
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:44,560
Come on.

1727
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:46,640
This. Right,

1728
01:39:48,080 --> 01:39:48,480
Right.

1729
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:54,560
Guys, I'm done with this page.

1730
01:39:54,560 --> 01:39:59,240
Find the only beach,
the only page remaining.

1731
01:39:59,240 --> 01:40:03,000
Now see the only player remaining now
is this employee list beach.

1732
01:40:03,640 --> 01:40:07,720
Can you see the only pages
remaining now is this employee list page.

1733
01:40:08,160 --> 01:40:09,880
Here we are using three locator.

1734
01:40:09,880 --> 01:40:12,480
See, the first one
is searching by adding using

1735
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:17,800
today's bid using search by 88.

1736
01:40:18,600 --> 01:40:23,160
We are using this search option and
we are taking their data from this list.

1737
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:25,400
Right. This. So we got three locators.

1738
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:27,600
Do we have already these
three locators and

1739
01:40:32,120 --> 01:40:32,680
right.

1740
01:40:33,480 --> 01:40:36,240
So now you get to and Aisha answer

1741
01:40:36,240 --> 01:40:39,320
to your question when we talk this page,

1742
01:40:39,320 --> 01:40:42,200
because this is a proper page
in the application,

1743
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:46,400
we will create a separate class
for this one.

1744
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:49,600
Go employee.

1745
01:40:50,920 --> 01:40:57,640
It's employee used page
since we have a proper plus,

1746
01:40:57,720 --> 01:40:59,720
since we have a proper screen

1747
01:40:59,720 --> 01:41:02,880
and then we have a proper
screen are using this particular page.

1748
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:04,320
Understood now.

1749
01:41:05,160 --> 01:41:05,760
Now understood.

1750
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:07,920
The concept of page object order design.

1751
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:10,680
We should not go with just one option
or something

1752
01:41:11,320 --> 01:41:14,680
built in unless we have the complete
screen in the application.

1753
01:41:14,680 --> 01:41:16,000
We may not be in the beach

1754
01:41:17,200 --> 01:41:23,760
already.

1755
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:26,120
Everyone understood these are not the

1756
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:30,160
everything we need new Plus,

1757
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:33,600
this is what we call
beach object model design.

1758
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:38,200
But you need to create the object
of the beach in this design.

1759
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:41,840
Then this is the model

1760
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:44,240
that's explain.

1761
01:41:44,240 --> 01:41:45,640
There's nobody understood now, right?

1762
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:48,840
I should.

1763
01:41:48,840 --> 01:41:51,600
So not on this beach. On this beach road.

1764
01:41:52,120 --> 01:41:55,200
We need certain locators on employee list
Beach

1765
01:41:55,560 --> 01:42:00,880
like we had locator for employees today
for the beach.

1766
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:03,920
You get up and let me go,
and this would be once again

1767
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:08,280
build me in this option.

1768
01:42:08,600 --> 01:42:13,520
When I saw this motion, this options
only the employee list an employee.

1769
01:42:14,040 --> 01:42:17,480
If if I do not write
this initial board page,

1770
01:42:17,480 --> 01:42:21,760
then what is the best place to make that
bet is another beach where we can do this.

1771
01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:24,160
I'm getting this option in.

1772
01:42:24,160 --> 01:42:27,400
This would be really great

1773
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:36,120
credit scoring.

1774
01:42:36,120 --> 01:42:39,040
Someone is obliged, Steve.

1775
01:42:39,640 --> 01:42:40,680
We are.

1776
01:42:40,680 --> 01:42:44,320
We are getting this employee list
and they options

1777
01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:46,000
in which beach

1778
01:42:48,360 --> 01:42:49,200
in this footbridge

1779
01:42:49,200 --> 01:42:52,280
only that's why we need to keep on
of this thing Barefoot Beach.

1780
01:42:52,520 --> 01:42:56,520
If these things are visible
at any of the beach and definitely will

1781
01:42:56,880 --> 01:42:59,840
a new class
we add this be just this locators there

1782
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:02,400
since again
they think this in their dispute building

1783
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:06,000
why way to create any of the replacement
necessary for this could not

1784
01:43:08,040 --> 01:43:10,120
now let me take the locator
one by one here.

1785
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:12,800
The first one is we need to open by any

1786
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:17,400
employee
for searching the employee search.

1787
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:19,960
So for that

1788
01:43:20,240 --> 01:43:26,120
this data
I need again from search employee.

1789
01:43:26,120 --> 01:43:29,360
So this is the only I will get from here

1790
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:34,240
and I will keep it in my
employee list page that you.

1791
01:43:36,240 --> 01:43:39,600
And after this I need search button

1792
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:42,720
so me as search button on this beach

1793
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:45,880
and this search done I'm departing

1794
01:43:45,880 --> 01:43:49,200
from this search but

1795
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:55,000
this also search for the new

1796
01:43:56,080 --> 01:43:56,600
guys.

1797
01:43:56,600 --> 01:43:58,400
Am I going bust or despite

1798
01:43:58,400 --> 01:44:00,640
because we already have this
locator straight,

1799
01:44:00,640 --> 01:44:02,160
I'm just copying and resort from here.

1800
01:44:02,160 --> 01:44:05,840
And there's the only thing I'm doing

1801
01:44:06,520 --> 01:44:07,560
is fine

1802
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:12,600
and only is always agree
everything is okay.

1803
01:44:12,600 --> 01:44:16,800
Go ahead and do.

1804
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:19,880
Employees are just tips now after this.

1805
01:44:20,640 --> 01:44:21,480
After this.

1806
01:44:21,480 --> 01:44:24,480
What we have to do this one.

1807
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:25,200
Great

1808
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:31,880
employee
search by name or something, right?

1809
01:44:31,880 --> 01:44:33,320
We can do this

1810
01:44:36,680 --> 01:44:38,160
for maybe we have some other look.

1811
01:44:38,160 --> 01:44:42,120
Sector will change for every value that

1812
01:44:50,760 --> 01:44:55,200
might need three Looking right now again,

1813
01:44:55,880 --> 01:44:58,280
the same stage public

1814
01:44:59,400 --> 01:45:01,200
beach name is employed is two page

1815
01:45:02,280 --> 01:45:03,200
will find

1816
01:45:03,240 --> 01:45:06,480
page 50 dot initialize elements

1817
01:45:06,680 --> 01:45:10,520
driver comment this find

1818
01:45:11,160 --> 01:45:12,200
nasty goes

1819
01:45:12,200 --> 01:45:17,600
now see we have all the locators read
all the locators in the respective pages

1820
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:20,680
you see next time all need to do

1821
01:45:20,680 --> 01:45:23,760
is we just need to fix
all of these things.

1822
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:25,920
How? Let's see

1823
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:30,360
here we need force name locator to add
the employee every single thing find.

1824
01:45:30,640 --> 01:45:33,840
So in the beginning of this step,
in the beginning of the step,

1825
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:37,160
I will create I will create the object

1826
01:45:37,640 --> 01:45:43,120
for this particular class,
for this particular class.

1827
01:45:43,120 --> 01:45:46,200
And now see,
do I need this web element from you

1828
01:45:48,160 --> 01:45:49,000
guys?

1829
01:45:50,160 --> 01:45:52,280
Do I need this very element from here? No.

1830
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:55,280
We can write this and not force name

1831
01:45:56,160 --> 01:45:58,320
that is already here.

1832
01:45:58,320 --> 01:46:01,440
We don't need this line.

1833
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:05,160
Similarly, and don't last name
look that is here.

1834
01:46:05,720 --> 01:46:07,120
So we don't need this line.

1835
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:10,640
Similarly, ID don't

1836
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:14,600
really

1837
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:16,840
look at it is here.

1838
01:46:16,840 --> 01:46:20,440
So we don't need this line as we

1839
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,960
connect.

1840
01:46:25,960 --> 01:46:28,080
Employee Fine.

1841
01:46:28,080 --> 01:46:30,120
So here also we can write simple.

1842
01:46:30,120 --> 01:46:33,200
This part is not employed.

1843
01:46:33,240 --> 01:46:33,720
We look at it.

1844
01:46:33,720 --> 01:46:36,080
We don't need this line

1845
01:46:37,640 --> 01:46:41,320
for to find no issues in this photo.

1846
01:46:41,440 --> 01:46:45,760
So here it don't photograph.

1847
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:48,600
So now we don't need this line.

1848
01:46:49,040 --> 01:46:50,760
If there is any rule. Best practice.

1849
01:46:50,760 --> 01:46:52,520
We're naming the object.

1850
01:46:52,520 --> 01:46:54,440
Yes, just connect.

1851
01:46:54,440 --> 01:46:56,880
So by the by the name date by default.

1852
01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:59,840
What should added, for example,
is this employee beach.

1853
01:47:00,160 --> 01:47:04,680
So the name of the object
should be like this small one employee.

1854
01:47:04,680 --> 01:47:06,760
Okay,
this is the best practice by default.

1855
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:09,040
You're intelligent.
Give you this addition.

1856
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:09,840
All right.

1857
01:47:10,160 --> 01:47:10,640
So nasty.

1858
01:47:10,640 --> 01:47:15,600
But just to give you the know, high level
information, I did the shorter one.

1859
01:47:15,960 --> 01:47:18,360
But yes, if you want to change,
you can change like this.

1860
01:47:18,360 --> 01:47:21,560
Okay.

1861
01:47:21,560 --> 01:47:22,200
Reading is

1862
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:24,320
now here.

1863
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:30,960
Also, we need these eight employed
beach rate is employed based on checkbox.

1864
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:33,480
We need point

1865
01:47:33,720 --> 01:47:36,320
and here also we need this employee page.

1866
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:40,720
Don't checkbox.

1867
01:47:40,720 --> 01:47:41,560
Got it.

1868
01:47:42,160 --> 01:47:44,760
Now for these three
also we don't need them.

1869
01:47:44,760 --> 01:47:45,880
Not anymore.

1870
01:47:45,880 --> 01:47:48,520
So just comment this nasty.

1871
01:47:48,520 --> 01:47:50,480
Your best guess is reduced.

1872
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:51,880
Choose here.

1873
01:47:51,880 --> 01:47:54,000
You need this very employee beach object.

1874
01:47:54,280 --> 01:47:56,720
Don't use it.

1875
01:47:56,720 --> 01:47:58,560
You don't need this.

1876
01:47:59,080 --> 01:48:01,760
You're Also you need an employee page
object.

1877
01:48:01,880 --> 01:48:05,000
Start It must work so you don't need this.

1878
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:08,680
You're also you need this object.

1879
01:48:08,680 --> 01:48:11,600
Start the password so you don't need this.

1880
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:15,120
It also just come in this part

1881
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:19,080
and then an employee page
or see important.

1882
01:48:19,080 --> 01:48:21,520
So we're going to make this part.

1883
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:24,160
Now see, your code looks clean.

1884
01:48:24,160 --> 01:48:27,920
Very simple code to read this and build

1885
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:31,840
this based this employee list option
we are getting from where

1886
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:38,160
this employee list option

1887
01:48:38,160 --> 01:48:44,320
we are getting from it.

1888
01:48:44,320 --> 01:48:46,920
Come on this board page.

1889
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:49,880
So we need this dashboard beach file

1890
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:54,360
is dashboard feature

1891
01:48:54,360 --> 01:48:57,000
to stick the look into the object is easy

1892
01:48:57,440 --> 01:49:07,000
as of now.

1893
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:07,800
Fine.

1894
01:49:08,040 --> 01:49:11,720
So here I'm writing for a dish
or simply needs to work.

1895
01:49:12,600 --> 01:49:12,960
Fine.

1896
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:16,000
So this location is normal in use

1897
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,440
employee search fruit available
on which please goes

1898
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:22,720

Employee search field is available
on which feature.

1900
01:49:30,680 --> 01:49:34,720
Again, sorry this employee search
with available employee search for you

1901
01:49:35,920 --> 01:49:36,240

1902
01:49:36,240 --> 01:49:38,960
This employee search field is available on

1903
01:49:40,320 --> 01:49:41,800
employee list page.

1904
01:49:41,800 --> 01:49:42,760
All right.

1905
01:49:43,200 --> 01:49:46,440
So employing this to beach
is equal scrutiny

1906
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:51,240
employee list page

1907
01:49:51,240 --> 01:49:54,400
being from here,
I will call this employee list.

1908
01:49:54,400 --> 01:49:55,960
Which board

1909
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:10,880
employee list
which store I the employee search

1910
01:50:13,360 --> 01:50:13,960
base.

1911
01:50:14,520 --> 01:50:17,280
And then the search within
is also available on the same page.

1912
01:50:18,360 --> 01:50:20,040
So dark search button.

1913
01:50:20,040 --> 01:50:22,240
I need now.

1914
01:50:22,240 --> 01:50:26,880
We don't need this element
we don't need disturb element as well.

1915
01:50:27,120 --> 01:50:27,960
Correct.

1916
01:50:28,920 --> 01:50:32,400
In this data I can keep again as of now
because using it for just work.

1917
01:50:32,640 --> 01:50:34,800
So that is completely fine.

1918
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:36,880
This employee button I'm getting from here

1919
01:50:38,360 --> 01:50:43,560
again are they should page it in bulletins
or take it from there

1920
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:47,520
and then we don't need
this particular proportion.

1921
01:50:49,200 --> 01:50:51,240
All right.

1922
01:50:51,240 --> 01:50:53,640
So we've fixed this particular
step, right?

1923
01:50:54,160 --> 01:50:56,640
You can fixed all of these steps here
also.

1924
01:50:56,640 --> 01:50:59,000
Or do you want me to fix every step
you send me

1925
01:51:01,320 --> 01:51:03,280

01:51:20,680 --> 01:51:24,400
So from here I will trade

1934
01:51:24,600 --> 01:51:27,600
Base Dark

After this. We need.

1938
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:38,080
We don't need this particular one,
so let's do it.

1939
01:51:38,080 --> 01:51:40,120
I see how busy you guys are.

1940
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:44,440
When I asked who is going to do any one,

1941
01:51:44,480 --> 01:51:49,240
it will follow.

1942
01:51:49,240 --> 01:51:51,720
Let me stop right now.

1943
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:54,800
Let me ask where you lost my

1944
01:51:55,880 --> 01:51:57,320
business

1945
01:51:58,520 --> 01:52:01,800
and your get that you lost, All right?

1946
01:52:02,680 --> 01:52:03,280
You lost.

1947
01:52:03,280 --> 01:52:11,920
It means you're writing something,
correct?

1948
01:52:11,920 --> 01:52:14,160
I'm watching. Which understand. Right.

1949
01:52:14,160 --> 01:52:15,440
So why you're typing, ma'am,

1950
01:52:15,440 --> 01:52:19,200
when I'm saying don't date, well,
you're lost in the end.

1951
01:52:19,240 --> 01:52:20,520
I give you this code, right?

1952
01:52:20,520 --> 01:52:22,240
I will give you this code.

1953
01:52:22,240 --> 01:52:23,400
So please watch.

1954
01:52:23,400 --> 01:52:27,640
Otherwise we'll end up with confusion.

1955
01:52:27,640 --> 01:52:28,920
I'm typing this for you.

1956
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:31,440
It is not for me.
I know how to create the framework.

1957
01:52:31,640 --> 01:52:35,400
I'm typing all of this things for you,
so please follow it.

1958
01:52:35,880 --> 01:52:37,960
Just look what I'm doing.

1959
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:40,480
So. So that you don't get confused.

1960
01:52:40,480 --> 01:52:44,440
That is the only intention I have
so that you guys don't lost.

1961
01:52:44,440 --> 01:52:46,280
It would be great to see.

1962
01:52:46,280 --> 01:52:48,840
Everyone is watching
and you're typing in there.

1963
01:52:48,840 --> 01:52:51,080
If you have any questions, read that.

1964
01:52:51,080 --> 01:52:52,320
It is pretty much.

1965
01:52:52,320 --> 01:52:53,320
Yeah. Gutting.

1966
01:52:53,320 --> 01:52:56,280
So I quit trying forward and it's

1967
01:52:56,760 --> 01:53:06,760
just.

1968
01:53:06,760 --> 01:53:09,000
Yes, yes, yes. That's what I'm saying.

1969
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:13,480
No, Abe, if you are typing,
then what would you do after the class

1970
01:53:14,480 --> 01:53:15,200
date time?

1971
01:53:15,200 --> 01:53:17,480
You have time right after the class.

1972
01:53:17,480 --> 01:53:19,880
You have time to type
to practice everything.

1973
01:53:20,160 --> 01:53:23,480
This is the time to get
the things understood right.

1974
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:26,840
So please watch what I'm doing right.

1975
01:53:26,840 --> 01:53:29,440
This is not rocket
science. It's a simple thing.

1976
01:53:29,640 --> 01:53:32,480
We get our locators from multiple places.

1977
01:53:32,760 --> 01:53:36,000
We collected them,
and then we put all of them in one place.

1978
01:53:36,160 --> 01:53:41,320
Right now, we are calling all these
locators one by one from that place.

1979
01:53:41,560 --> 01:53:47,160
So earlier we had a different could not
get a listing that could be advanced one.

1980
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:50,200
There's the only thing I'm doing

1981
01:53:50,200 --> 01:54:00,360
that is this is the only thing I will not.

1982
01:54:00,360 --> 01:54:01,520
So please follow me.

1983
01:54:01,520 --> 01:54:04,520
Please follow me.

1984
01:54:04,520 --> 01:54:06,840
Now, here

1985
01:54:07,600 --> 01:54:09,960
we got this fixed dashboard.

1986
01:54:11,080 --> 01:54:13,480
But first name, last name, First time,
Last name.

1987
01:54:13,480 --> 01:54:15,840
We one which begins to mean on

1988
01:54:17,480 --> 01:54:19,520
it and blank page

1989
01:54:19,840 --> 01:54:22,560
is equal to new

1990
01:54:27,160 --> 01:54:27,520
page.

1991
01:54:27,520 --> 01:54:28,480
Fine.

1992
01:54:29,160 --> 01:54:30,680
So here

1993
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:36,800
at the start, enforcement

1994
01:54:46,320 --> 01:54:49,920
Roadster, the key is below this book.

1995
01:54:49,920 --> 01:54:52,120
Similarly here

1996
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:55,680
employee page don't

1997
01:54:55,680 --> 01:54:58,040
last name,
so we don't need this locator either.

1998
01:54:58,200 --> 01:55:00,240
This is good all the way. Really.

1999
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:02,600
I'm just removing one by one

2000
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:05,160
so that it will be really easy for you to
in this date.

2001
01:55:06,440 --> 01:55:09,200
Similarly, let me take this particular one

2002
01:55:09,680 --> 01:55:12,720
right and book it here

2003
01:55:12,720 --> 01:55:16,800
so that this time
when I'm picking this new employ

2004
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:18,800
object, don't

2005
01:55:20,800 --> 01:55:23,760
post names.

2006
01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:25,720
Forgot to put

2007
01:55:26,040 --> 01:55:30,920
line four before.

2008
01:55:30,920 --> 01:55:31,440
Yes, ma'am.

2009
01:55:31,440 --> 01:55:34,960
Thank you so much.

2010
01:55:34,960 --> 01:55:37,200
You got it.

2011
01:55:37,200 --> 01:55:39,800
So we don't need this now.

2012
01:55:40,040 --> 01:55:42,080
We don't need this as well. Right.

2013
01:55:42,080 --> 01:55:46,920
Because we are going to write an
employee beach dot last name.

2014
01:55:48,680 --> 01:55:50,360
We don't need it.

2015
01:55:50,360 --> 01:55:51,760
So don't need this either.

2016
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:56,040
Like an employee page or dark middle name.

2017
01:55:56,040 --> 01:55:58,920
So we don't need it.

2018
01:55:58,920 --> 01:56:03,000
Find again, see how many times
we are using this post name last name

2019
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:05,640
every time we were passing the data.

2020
01:56:05,640 --> 01:56:06,880
We are having a hard time now.

2021
01:56:06,880 --> 01:56:09,600
We don't need to do all of this stuff.

2022
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:13,040
Simple thing At the end, the object called

2023
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:17,160
this object called the locator.

2024
01:56:17,160 --> 01:56:17,960
Again,

2025
01:56:19,080 --> 01:56:21,880
call the object.

2026
01:56:21,880 --> 01:56:23,640
Call the locator.

2027
01:56:23,640 --> 01:56:25,440
Save the data

2028
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:28,880
for the same thing we are doing.

2029
01:56:28,920 --> 01:56:32,400
Forward looking name as it was

2030
01:56:37,960 --> 01:56:39,520
fine.

2031
01:56:39,520 --> 01:56:40,840
We are close guys.

2032
01:56:40,840 --> 01:56:42,640
We are close now

2033
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:51,480
that I believe we have written this much.

2034
01:56:51,480 --> 01:56:52,880
Of course of

2035
01:56:54,600 --> 01:56:57,360
life and don't

2036
01:56:57,360 --> 01:57:00,720
go past a really simplified

2037
01:57:08,400 --> 01:57:10,520
Yes is I read all of this

2038
01:57:10,520 --> 01:57:13,320
things for you
so that you guys don't have to write it

2039
01:57:14,160 --> 01:57:17,640
just to use this code red as a reference.

2040
01:57:17,640 --> 01:57:19,200
So again,

2041
01:57:20,400 --> 01:57:22,200
the object,

2042
01:57:22,440 --> 01:57:26,640
all the locators.

2043
01:57:26,640 --> 01:57:28,680
Fine. Same thing.

2044
01:57:29,600 --> 01:57:31,920
Use this object,

2045
01:57:32,160 --> 01:57:34,200
call the locator so that we don't need

2046
01:57:34,200 --> 01:57:37,360
this element either.

2047
01:57:37,360 --> 01:57:38,280
Thank you so much.

2048
01:57:38,280 --> 01:57:42,920
And employee peach again,
we need layer bash food.

2049
01:57:42,920 --> 01:57:47,920
Peach is the you dish food peach go here

2050
01:57:48,600 --> 01:57:52,080
managed on an employee to

2051
01:57:54,680 --> 01:57:55,640
Finally

2052
01:57:55,640 --> 01:57:58,480
we fixed all the code
in this particular class

2053
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:02,960
we fit the complete code in this class.

2054
01:58:02,960 --> 01:58:05,960
We fixed it in their neighborhood pages
I believe.

2055
01:58:06,240 --> 01:58:10,200
Yes, we fixed it in employee search.

2056
01:58:10,320 --> 01:58:14,880
Step or dashboard We fixed.

2057
01:58:15,440 --> 01:58:17,240
But here we're doing fixed,
so let's do it.

2058
01:58:17,240 --> 01:58:19,800
Satiety is on employee list.

2059
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:23,520
Peach equals to new employee list.

2060
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:24,440
Peach

2061
01:58:25,160 --> 01:58:27,120
in district that we will be getting from

2062
01:58:27,120 --> 01:58:30,080
my employee list, which on

2063
01:58:31,200 --> 01:58:34,080
your front search button

2064
01:58:34,760 --> 01:58:37,760
finally shows
I do have search button on this page only,

2065
01:58:38,960 --> 01:58:39,440
so let

2066
01:58:39,440 --> 01:58:42,880
me copy and clear the object here

2067
01:58:43,600 --> 01:58:48,440
on my employee list page Search button.

2068
01:58:48,440 --> 01:58:48,800
Fine.

2069
01:58:48,840 --> 01:58:50,760
So now we don't need this element.

2070
01:58:50,760 --> 01:58:52,200
We don't need this element.

2071
01:58:52,200 --> 01:58:53,280
I'm just coming thing.

2072
01:58:53,280 --> 01:58:56,040
I'm not deleting
so that you guys can understand.

2073
01:58:56,040 --> 01:58:59,400
Great what we did earlier
and what we are doing now.

2074
01:58:59,640 --> 01:59:00,360
Great

2075
01:59:05,840 --> 01:59:06,120
here.

2076
01:59:06,120 --> 01:59:08,880
Also state here also.

2077
01:59:08,880 --> 01:59:10,240
Yes please to yes.

2078
01:59:10,240 --> 01:59:12,120
And I'm not deleting this word
I'm missing.

2079
01:59:12,120 --> 01:59:13,680
I'm not deleting

2080
01:59:17,600 --> 01:59:20,280
this to preach employees of the state.

2081
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:22,760
My name was imposter data

2082
01:59:23,520 --> 01:59:26,920
so we don't need this again is

2083
01:59:26,920 --> 01:59:28,720
going to log in steps

2084
01:59:28,720 --> 01:59:31,360
we see log in page right.

2085
01:59:33,040 --> 01:59:35,760
Every tree object
we have created so far here.

2086
01:59:35,760 --> 01:59:38,400
This one.

2087
01:59:38,400 --> 01:59:41,520
So now, now we are fixed.
We are fixed. See?

2088
01:59:41,520 --> 01:59:43,720
No more locators available. See?

2089
01:59:43,720 --> 01:59:46,560
Not in this page. No more locators.

2090
01:59:46,560 --> 01:59:47,880
Not in this page.

2091
01:59:47,880 --> 01:59:49,440
There is no located in this page.

2092
01:59:50,400 --> 01:59:52,000
Norton Dashboard Dashboard steps.

2093
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,360
Right. And not employee steps.

2094
01:59:54,360 --> 01:59:57,480
It is no longer available Base.

2095
01:59:57,480 --> 02:00:01,480
So my every local that is passing
from my employee Beige dashboard

2096
02:00:01,480 --> 02:00:07,040
page employee list logging
which is this correct?

2097
02:00:07,040 --> 02:00:09,800
Is this correct discordance

2098
02:00:09,800 --> 02:00:12,960
so first was let's try to run very basic.

2099
02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:14,640
So now you read lipstick.

2100
02:00:14,640 --> 02:00:16,960
Anyone scenario for example one smoke.

2101
02:00:17,640 --> 02:00:20,320
I'm going to take this right

2102
02:00:20,320 --> 02:00:23,400
I'll let me take this one is this easy?

2103
02:00:23,880 --> 02:00:24,640
Okay.

2104
02:00:24,720 --> 02:00:29,720
So to check whether might look like
they're sort of working or not, click

2105
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,160
just to check
whether my locators are working or not.

2106
02:00:32,280 --> 02:00:35,800
Let's execute this scenario first

2107
02:00:44,240 --> 02:00:45,680
days of working

2108
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,120
there is good working or not.

2109
02:00:51,120 --> 02:00:54,480
Still.

2110
02:00:54,480 --> 02:00:54,960
So what?

2111
02:00:54,960 --> 02:00:57,680
It is working,
it means my locators mapping

2112
02:00:57,960 --> 02:01:01,080
object initialization constructor calling.

2113
02:01:01,200 --> 02:01:03,720
Everything is working. Absolutely. Getting

2114
02:01:05,680 --> 02:01:06,480
correct

2115
02:01:11,440 --> 02:01:13,720
or unrelated right now.

2116
02:01:13,920 --> 02:01:17,880
Now let me simplify it more.

2117
02:01:17,880 --> 02:01:18,960
Right. Let's go ahead.

2118
02:01:18,960 --> 02:01:20,880
One more step further.

2119
02:01:20,880 --> 02:01:21,760
One step further.

2120
02:01:21,760 --> 02:01:24,240
We will go to right. Okay.

2121
02:01:24,680 --> 02:01:26,040
Ready, everyone

2122
02:01:29,640 --> 02:01:31,480
wants to taste.

2123
02:01:31,640 --> 02:01:33,160
I need your energy.

2124
02:01:33,160 --> 02:01:34,600
I am running out of my battery.

2125
02:01:34,600 --> 02:01:37,440
I need your energy. Then

2126
02:01:37,440 --> 02:01:39,360
are you guys ready to learn
one more important thing

2127
02:01:39,360 --> 02:01:45,120
here?

2128
02:01:45,120 --> 02:01:46,440
Months?

2129
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:49,280
Yes. Look what we are going to do.

2130
02:01:49,280 --> 02:01:51,120
So now you'll see if.

2131
02:01:51,120 --> 02:01:53,160
I go in my eight employee steps.

2132
02:01:53,400 --> 02:01:54,400
You see,

2133
02:01:55,040 --> 02:01:57,840
I created a lot of object
dashboard page here.

2134
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:03,160
Then this work page here, then employee
new bigger than new employee page book.

2135
02:02:03,480 --> 02:02:05,680
I missed you save button better

2136
02:02:06,920 --> 02:02:09,840
again, I have to create the new page
for this page.

2137
02:02:09,960 --> 02:02:12,880
New page eight new

2138
02:02:12,880 --> 02:02:16,400
employees
includes two new in employee page

2139
02:02:20,280 --> 02:02:21,360
and then I

2140
02:02:22,120 --> 02:02:24,960
am going don't see important

2141
02:02:26,600 --> 02:02:26,760
here.

2142
02:02:26,760 --> 02:02:29,080
We do it in one installing page. Right?

2143
02:02:29,320 --> 02:02:33,320
So now see I'm taking note of objects
read every

2144
02:02:33,560 --> 02:02:35,560
and these objects are such a been for me

2145
02:02:37,200 --> 02:02:39,800
read a lot of objects.

2146
02:02:39,800 --> 02:02:42,600
I don't want to create this object
so many places.

2147
02:02:43,600 --> 02:02:46,400
See here what I am doing right now

2148
02:02:48,120 --> 02:02:50,240
I have my logging page for example.

2149
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:52,960
This is my class logging page.

2150
02:02:52,960 --> 02:02:55,200
If I am having dashboard four steps,

2151
02:02:55,200 --> 02:02:58,920
I'm creating the object for this one.

2152
02:02:58,920 --> 02:03:00,920
If I'm having an employee steps,

2153
02:03:00,920 --> 02:03:03,120
I'm creating the object
for those same one.

2154
02:03:03,960 --> 02:03:06,480
Even if I have any steps
I have to create in

2155
02:03:06,480 --> 02:03:09,720
different objects,
I want to get rid of this part.

2156
02:03:09,720 --> 02:03:12,440
I don't want invitation anymore. Fine.

2157
02:03:12,800 --> 02:03:15,760
If I don't want reputation any more,
what we can do

2158
02:03:15,760 --> 02:03:18,520
is we can create under the steps.

2159
02:03:18,840 --> 02:03:21,920
We can create one class which will

2160
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:25,240
initialize all the objects at one time.

2161
02:03:25,440 --> 02:03:28,640
So next time
we don't need to create any object.

2162
02:03:30,480 --> 02:03:31,800
We will create

2163
02:03:31,800 --> 02:03:37,040
one class there to be initialized
all the object at one time.

2164
02:03:37,200 --> 02:03:41,240
So next time
we don't have to create any other object.

2165
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:44,880
Only that object we can call everywhere.

2166
02:03:44,880 --> 02:03:47,040
Everybody be at. How did we show you?

2167
02:03:47,400 --> 02:03:50,640
So the name of this class
we are going to make?

2168
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,240
No, this is not talks again.

2169
02:03:53,240 --> 02:03:55,280
I'm telling you what is hooks
is different.

2170
02:03:55,280 --> 02:03:57,600
This is object oriented programing.

2171
02:03:57,600 --> 02:03:59,560
So everything is object.

2172
02:03:59,560 --> 02:04:02,400
I'm going to do page in me.

2173
02:04:02,880 --> 02:04:05,160
She aligns

2174
02:04:05,520 --> 02:04:07,960
what is the name of my class is
the name of

2175
02:04:07,960 --> 02:04:12,360
my class is bead initialization.

2176
02:04:12,360 --> 02:04:15,000
Bead initialize a very simple class.

2177
02:04:15,680 --> 02:04:16,720
Very simple class.

2178
02:04:16,720 --> 02:04:19,200
Let me show you what
we need to write in this class.

2179
02:04:20,240 --> 02:04:22,800
You will definitely like this
particular part.

2180
02:04:22,800 --> 02:04:25,440
What I'm trying to show
you don't see in this bit.

2181
02:04:25,440 --> 02:04:28,440
Initialize it. I am with the right symbol.

2182
02:04:28,440 --> 02:04:32,560
All the objects read
so I'm making my objects my object.

2183
02:04:32,560 --> 02:04:33,520
This public

2184
02:04:34,560 --> 02:04:36,840
static make

2185
02:04:36,840 --> 02:04:38,880
public this big

2186
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:42,400
log in page. Right.

2187
02:04:42,400 --> 02:04:45,840
And the object name
I will use this log in simple.

2188
02:04:47,080 --> 02:04:49,360
Similarly, I have public

2189
02:04:50,480 --> 02:04:51,960
static

2190
02:04:52,640 --> 02:04:54,720
dashboard page.

2191
02:04:54,840 --> 02:05:00,720
This object is dash simple extinguish.

2192
02:05:00,720 --> 02:05:03,840
I am having an employee beach. Great.

2193
02:05:04,200 --> 02:05:06,360
So this would be my object.

2194
02:05:07,600 --> 02:05:09,640
I am Royalist Peach.

2195
02:05:09,640 --> 02:05:11,680
So one

2196
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:15,600
impressionist beach.

2197
02:05:15,600 --> 02:05:17,880
So this would be my object.

2198
02:05:17,880 --> 02:05:20,360
Three things We make them public

2199
02:05:21,680 --> 02:05:23,040
static.

2200
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,040
This one also only make them public.

2201
02:05:26,680 --> 02:05:28,360
Let's take

2202
02:05:28,640 --> 02:05:30,720
now see what I'm doing.

2203
02:05:30,720 --> 02:05:33,720
Simply, simply, I'm writing one method.

2204
02:05:33,960 --> 02:05:36,640
And the method name is

2205
02:05:36,640 --> 02:05:40,280
this method
I'm going to call public estate White ID,

2206
02:05:41,200 --> 02:05:44,760
I'm calling it a neat shin Lies

2207
02:05:45,760 --> 02:05:47,520
Beach

2208
02:05:47,960 --> 02:05:49,160
Beach

2209
02:05:49,680 --> 02:05:51,040
Object.

2210
02:05:51,040 --> 02:05:52,720
This is my method.

2211
02:05:52,720 --> 02:06:00,600
All right, guys, guys, this is my method.

2212
02:06:01,200 --> 02:06:05,360
Now, what I'm going to do here in this
method, I'm writing first,

2213
02:06:05,440 --> 02:06:08,840
This is the log
in which is equal to the new log image.

2214
02:06:09,520 --> 02:06:10,440
I initialized

2215
02:06:11,400 --> 02:06:12,200
trade.

2216
02:06:12,360 --> 02:06:14,840
Then dashboard is equal

2217
02:06:14,840 --> 02:06:18,080
to new dashboard, which initialized.

2218
02:06:19,160 --> 02:06:21,360
Then add new employee pages equals

2219
02:06:21,360 --> 02:06:24,000
to new employee page initialized.

2220
02:06:25,360 --> 02:06:27,200
Then employee list it is equals

2221
02:06:27,200 --> 02:06:32,280
for me.

2222
02:06:32,280 --> 02:06:34,960
Employee that's initialized.

2223
02:06:34,960 --> 02:06:38,360
Now see,
all of my objects are initialized.

2224
02:06:38,880 --> 02:06:41,720
Next, next time, if you come across

2225
02:06:42,120 --> 02:06:46,000
if you come across and explain
any other for example,

2226
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:49,840
new page, you create new class,
you create what you need to do.

2227
02:06:50,280 --> 02:06:55,440
Just create the object of the class here
and initialize that object.

2228
02:06:55,440 --> 02:06:58,280
In this particular class, a student

2229
02:07:00,600 --> 02:07:01,640
understood this.

2230
02:07:01,640 --> 02:07:03,120
Know how this will work?

2231
02:07:03,120 --> 02:07:04,920
I'm showing you so far.

2232
02:07:04,920 --> 02:07:07,440
Take me this part clear to everyone.

2233
02:07:07,440 --> 02:07:09,600
This page initialize
that part is geared to implement

2234
02:07:11,880 --> 02:07:12,760
newborn

2235
02:07:17,480 --> 02:07:18,400
nines.

2236
02:07:18,400 --> 02:07:21,240
Now see what I'm doing now
see what I'm doing.

2237
02:07:21,240 --> 02:07:26,160
This first piece of your deal status,
everyone, whether you're doing it or not.

2238
02:07:26,160 --> 02:07:26,480
Come on.

2239
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:31,080
Very interesting thing we are going to do

2240
02:07:31,800 --> 02:07:33,560
quickly update your status.

2241
02:07:33,560 --> 02:07:36,960
All the geniuses still are like
nice, nice.

2242
02:07:38,400 --> 02:07:41,320
When you are exhausted,
learn how to take the list.

2243
02:07:41,400 --> 02:07:45,440
Not to quit, not to last in between.

2244
02:07:45,440 --> 02:07:48,080
I think it's quite

2245
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,480
clear that this bacteria human right.

2246
02:07:51,960 --> 02:07:55,520
We are still geniuses right now
going to your common methods

2247
02:07:56,040 --> 02:07:58,920
see in your common method straightforward.

2248
02:07:59,040 --> 02:08:02,280
Let me show you
which is the initial point.

2249
02:08:02,640 --> 02:08:04,600
Which is the initial point.

2250
02:08:04,600 --> 02:08:06,760
The initial point. We have hooks.

2251
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:11,040
The initial point could be a hook,
say from here might in

2252
02:08:11,040 --> 02:08:17,360
that execution is a starting correct,
but it is precondition.

2253
02:08:17,360 --> 02:08:20,480
I have been in the hooks in precondition.

2254
02:08:20,640 --> 02:08:23,560
I put which particular step,
which particular

2255
02:08:23,560 --> 02:08:27,480
method open
browser and launch application ladies

2256
02:08:29,160 --> 02:08:32,200
open blue closed blue fine.

2257
02:08:32,520 --> 02:08:36,240
So here you'll see right

2258
02:08:37,080 --> 02:08:40,440
this one particular one right in the
before this precondition.

2259
02:08:40,840 --> 02:08:45,440
In this precondition we are calling open
browser and launch application method

2260
02:08:45,720 --> 02:08:50,200
and this method is available.

2261
02:08:50,200 --> 02:08:52,480
This method is available

2262
02:08:53,120 --> 02:08:55,080
in my common methods. Right.

2263
02:08:55,080 --> 02:09:00,240
So let's come to my common
method and extend extends here

2264
02:09:00,600 --> 02:09:03,480
beach Initialize the class VI

2265
02:09:03,760 --> 02:09:06,840
because then I want to initialize
all the objects.

2266
02:09:06,840 --> 02:09:12,760
I want to initialize objects
of all the classes when I actually start

2267
02:09:12,760 --> 02:09:14,280
my execution.

2268
02:09:14,280 --> 02:09:17,120
So I'm actually starting my execution
here.

2269
02:09:17,320 --> 02:09:19,880
So I am seeing the

2270
02:09:19,880 --> 02:09:22,920
the moment I'm going to call my browser,

2271
02:09:23,440 --> 02:09:28,800
the moment I'm going to launch my
until initialize all the objects.

2272
02:09:28,800 --> 02:09:33,240
So now here I'm going to write this
method called initialize page objects

2273
02:09:33,560 --> 02:09:39,240
in my open
browser launch application method.

2274
02:09:39,240 --> 02:09:39,880
Can you see those?

2275
02:09:40,920 --> 02:09:42,080
Can you see

2276
02:09:42,800 --> 02:09:43,920
what I'm doing?

2277
02:09:43,920 --> 02:09:48,760
I extend this page, initialize
a class in my common methods.

2278
02:09:49,320 --> 02:09:53,160
When I got this in my common methods
I call this particular

2279
02:09:53,160 --> 02:09:57,200
method from my page initialization class.

2280
02:09:57,200 --> 02:09:59,600
Is this clear to everyone

2281
02:10:03,240 --> 02:10:04,560
now what it will do?

2282
02:10:04,560 --> 02:10:07,000
What it will do? What I do This
the moment.

2283
02:10:07,600 --> 02:10:12,200
The moment I am going to initialize the
I'm going to start my execution.

2284
02:10:12,440 --> 02:10:16,800
So in the very beginning of my execution,
the very beginning of my execution,

2285
02:10:17,080 --> 02:10:20,880
my hooks will call this method open
browser launch application,

2286
02:10:21,040 --> 02:10:26,120
and this method will initialize
all the object to all the classes

2287
02:10:26,280 --> 02:10:30,360
because initialized based object
method is meant called here.

2288
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:35,160
Understood.

2289
02:10:35,160 --> 02:10:36,240
Understood.

2290
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,080
Now see now see the difference.

2291
02:10:39,240 --> 02:10:40,520
Now see the difference.

2292
02:10:40,520 --> 02:10:44,120
We extended this common
methods everywhere.

2293
02:10:44,120 --> 02:10:45,200
We extended this common.

2294
02:10:45,200 --> 02:10:49,400
But they're simply buildings.

2295
02:10:49,400 --> 02:10:50,360
Yes. Correct.

2296
02:10:50,360 --> 02:10:52,960
So now now let's go to log in to see.

2297
02:10:53,480 --> 02:10:55,240
I have common methods here.

2298
02:10:55,240 --> 02:10:58,320
In log instance,
I have common methods right?

2299
02:10:58,320 --> 02:11:02,760
It means the object we have already
initialized for log in page.

2300
02:11:03,360 --> 02:11:05,400
I don't need to
create this object anymore.

2301
02:11:06,800 --> 02:11:08,440
Why? It is giving me the error.

2302
02:11:08,440 --> 02:11:10,880
Because the object name is logging page.

2303
02:11:11,600 --> 02:11:14,760
The object name is log in page red case.

2304
02:11:15,360 --> 02:11:17,040
I don't need this object here

2305
02:11:17,040 --> 02:11:20,520
because the object name is login page,
which we created.

2306
02:11:21,200 --> 02:11:23,480
I don't need this object also.

2307
02:11:23,480 --> 02:11:23,920
Right.

2308
02:11:23,920 --> 02:11:27,600
Because the object name is logging peach.

2309
02:11:27,600 --> 02:11:27,960
You know.

2310
02:11:27,960 --> 02:11:30,680
So it is log in page

2311
02:11:30,680 --> 02:11:32,760
is also login page,

2312
02:11:32,760 --> 02:11:35,200
which is also log in page.

2313
02:11:35,200 --> 02:11:38,720
I don't need this
also because object name is

2314
02:11:39,840 --> 02:11:40,640
this log in.

2315
02:11:40,640 --> 02:11:43,240
I just need to correct the log

2316
02:11:43,240 --> 02:11:45,040
posting mixed

2317
02:11:48,360 --> 02:11:48,800
more.

2318
02:11:50,880 --> 02:11:51,520
Think thinking

2319
02:12:05,160 --> 02:12:07,560
now next time.

2320
02:12:07,560 --> 02:12:10,080
Could we also put this initialized
method insert hook.

2321
02:12:10,080 --> 02:12:11,560
No, no, no, no, no.

2322
02:12:11,560 --> 02:12:13,920
There's we're going to see
see in your hooks.

2323
02:12:14,400 --> 02:12:15,080
In your hooks.

2324
02:12:15,080 --> 02:12:17,240
So you have this open browser, correct.

2325
02:12:17,240 --> 02:12:19,760
You are extending common methods in hooks.

2326
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:20,400
Understood.

2327
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,880
So you are getting this common
methods technique.

2328
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:28,200
So we need to call it
we need to call in common methods.

2329
02:12:28,360 --> 02:12:32,320
So the time when you call, when you extend
the properties of common methods

2330
02:12:32,640 --> 02:12:35,720
by default, you will get the properties
of your page initializes.

2331
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:40,800
And you don't need to be initialized here
because you are calling this

2332
02:12:40,800 --> 02:12:44,640
particular method in hooks and this method
is already having been initialized.

2333
02:12:44,640 --> 02:12:48,280
Object. Okay, this.

2334
02:12:48,280 --> 02:12:50,960
All right, fine.

2335
02:12:51,600 --> 02:12:55,200
Now let's go to base footsteps first.

2336
02:12:55,200 --> 02:12:56,360
Let me fix it.

2337
02:12:56,360 --> 02:12:58,560
Also, you'll see this dashboard page.

2338
02:12:58,560 --> 02:13:00,760
But I don't need this time.

2339
02:13:00,760 --> 02:13:04,960
So it converts again in purple
because see, what it says is steps

2340
02:13:05,440 --> 02:13:09,240
be it initialized from initialized
or this object is coming in.

2341
02:13:09,240 --> 02:13:11,840
You see public static basswood peach.

2342
02:13:12,800 --> 02:13:15,720
It is coming
from the just also where to log in page.

2343
02:13:15,960 --> 02:13:17,600
It says step start page.

2344
02:13:17,600 --> 02:13:20,520
Initialize the public static log in beach.

2345
02:13:21,040 --> 02:13:22,720
We created this object in page.

2346
02:13:22,720 --> 02:13:27,200
Initialize that part one.

2347
02:13:27,200 --> 02:13:30,240
Now you see your code, now
you see your code

2348
02:13:30,960 --> 02:13:33,520
you unit to click on log in bottom. Right.

2349
02:13:33,640 --> 02:13:35,760
Nobody's gone the object

2350
02:13:36,680 --> 02:13:39,600
to perform click call the object.

2351
02:13:39,600 --> 02:13:41,600
Call to perform in the case.

2352
02:13:41,600 --> 02:13:42,520
Call the object.

2353
02:13:42,520 --> 02:13:43,720
Call the allocator.

2354
02:13:43,720 --> 02:13:46,320
Performance indicators one very Easy.

2355
02:13:46,440 --> 02:13:47,160
Right.

2356
02:13:47,480 --> 02:13:50,600
Let's do this for the remaining part
as we see.

2357
02:13:50,600 --> 02:13:52,640
Do we need this dashboard plate
object case?

2358
02:13:52,640 --> 02:13:56,240
Then we here we need this object.

2359
02:13:56,240 --> 02:13:57,720
No Coming.

2360
02:13:57,720 --> 02:14:00,720
Let's see.
It started giving me any errors.

2361
02:14:00,720 --> 02:14:01,760
It's not giving me any.

2362
02:14:01,760 --> 02:14:04,320
Is going to employ such.

2363
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:06,920
Do we need this employee list
for the object? No.

2364
02:14:07,400 --> 02:14:09,360
See it converts.

2365
02:14:09,360 --> 02:14:11,240
Do we need this dashboard? No.

2366
02:14:11,240 --> 02:14:13,360
See, it converts.

2367
02:14:13,360 --> 02:14:15,480
Just play with the code employee list
page.

2368
02:14:15,480 --> 02:14:21,280
No, it converts
employee list page not converted. So

2369
02:14:22,680 --> 02:14:25,000
in this case we are just commenting.

2370
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:28,000
We're reducing the code
now one by one. See?

2371
02:14:28,680 --> 02:14:32,520
Now let's go to an employee steps

2372
02:14:33,120 --> 02:14:34,320
commenting this part.

2373
02:14:34,320 --> 02:14:35,200
Fine.

2374
02:14:35,320 --> 02:14:36,760
It's working.

2375
02:14:36,800 --> 02:14:38,720
Amending this part fine.

2376
02:14:38,720 --> 02:14:40,680
Still it is working.

2377
02:14:41,640 --> 02:14:43,520
Great, great.

2378
02:14:43,520 --> 02:14:44,000
Yeah,

2379
02:14:44,880 --> 02:14:47,480
we would play if we know how to play that.

2380
02:14:47,520 --> 02:14:48,880
They're sort of teaching you.

2381
02:14:48,880 --> 02:14:51,280
That's what I'm teaching you, right

2382
02:14:53,400 --> 02:14:54,920
now. Just a command.

2383
02:14:54,920 --> 02:14:57,000
Whenever you initialized all the objects.

2384
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:58,920
We don't need objects anymore.

2385
02:14:58,920 --> 02:15:00,360
Multiple times.

2386
02:15:00,360 --> 02:15:02,760
One place we defined for the objects.

2387
02:15:02,760 --> 02:15:07,120
That one place
is calling all of my objects.

2388
02:15:07,120 --> 02:15:07,920
Right, guys?

2389
02:15:07,920 --> 02:15:10,040
This one place
is calling all of my objects.

2390
02:15:10,040 --> 02:15:12,240
So we don't make objects
any more externally.

2391
02:15:13,200 --> 02:15:15,680
So now, see all the objects I fixed here,

2392
02:15:16,440 --> 02:15:18,960
I fixed all the objects here as well.

2393
02:15:19,600 --> 02:15:22,560
I don't need this object. Find it fixed.

2394
02:15:23,880 --> 02:15:27,120
It is also fixed.

2395
02:15:27,120 --> 02:15:29,640
This one also fixed. Fine.

2396
02:15:29,640 --> 02:15:32,000
We don't need this part.

2397
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:35,360
This one also fixed.

2398
02:15:35,360 --> 02:15:37,200
This one also fixed.

2399
02:15:37,200 --> 02:15:39,920
And this one also fixed.

2400
02:15:40,120 --> 02:15:46,080
Fine.

2401
02:15:46,080 --> 02:15:48,320
Correct. Got it. Got it.

2402
02:15:48,640 --> 02:15:53,280
First I gave you the linear solution
and then give you the quick one.

2403
02:15:53,920 --> 02:15:54,400
Right.

2404
02:15:54,400 --> 02:15:58,160
So therefore you understand the importance
of this quick or quicker ones.

2405
02:15:58,400 --> 02:15:59,120
Okay.

2406
02:15:59,640 --> 02:16:04,040
So now you see the this baseboard
stability segregated world, right

2407
02:16:04,320 --> 02:16:06,760
employee suggested very segregated

2408
02:16:07,120 --> 02:16:11,280
log in is steps very segregated train
everything is segregated

2409
02:16:11,280 --> 02:16:15,200
no separate state
organized easy to read correct

2410
02:16:17,280 --> 02:16:18,480
that days

2411
02:16:21,440 --> 02:16:25,160
should would title once again
so that whatever the things we have added

2412
02:16:25,560 --> 02:16:28,720
just we want to make sure the rendered
things are working or not

2413
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:30,800
so next running

2414
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:39,760
initialized

2415
02:16:39,760 --> 02:16:44,000
all the objects getting the data
from log in page, building it here,

2416
02:16:44,360 --> 02:16:53,040
verify their dashboard page and it's gone.

2417
02:16:53,040 --> 02:16:55,320
Is this clear to everyone screams

2418
02:17:12,600 --> 02:17:13,480
this one

2419
02:17:13,480 --> 02:17:15,800
because this one of the points
I need to add and

2420
02:17:17,200 --> 02:17:18,840
that's why you see all this would

2421
02:17:18,840 --> 02:17:21,680
also bring the pages in this page
initializing.

2422
02:17:21,920 --> 02:17:24,720
Once I know all of these things
in the grid, then it becomes blue.

2423
02:17:25,160 --> 02:17:26,280
There's one.

2424
02:17:26,920 --> 02:17:31,320
It's stored in the repository
it's one local.

2425
02:17:31,320 --> 02:17:32,560
Yeah. No, I will.

2426
02:17:32,560 --> 02:17:35,720
I will for sure

2427
02:17:42,840 --> 02:17:44,600
will replace

2428
02:17:46,080 --> 02:17:46,680
so far.

2429
02:17:46,680 --> 02:17:47,680
Any questions?

2430
02:17:47,680 --> 02:17:48,680
Anyone

2431
02:17:58,880 --> 02:17:59,840
over?

2432
02:17:59,880 --> 02:18:05,160
None.

2433
02:18:05,160 --> 02:18:08,280
This is the actual framework
that we are making now.

2434
02:18:09,640 --> 02:18:13,040
Yes. Tomorrow is a review
on every property

2435
02:18:15,040 --> 02:18:17,520
in same things on the we now guys.

2436
02:18:17,520 --> 02:18:19,600
See now see one more thing.

2437
02:18:19,600 --> 02:18:21,640
Can we go to a little more logic
one more time.

2438
02:18:22,200 --> 02:18:24,680
Sure. And so this is the logic.

2439
02:18:24,840 --> 02:18:26,480
Logic is page object model design.

2440
02:18:26,480 --> 02:18:28,080
We right

2441
02:18:28,680 --> 02:18:31,760
according to this page object
moderate design button, right.

2442
02:18:32,160 --> 02:18:34,680
What we need, we need to basically

2443
02:18:35,280 --> 02:18:38,160
define all the objects, all the functions

2444
02:18:38,600 --> 02:18:41,920
related to one particular screen
in one separate class.

2445
02:18:42,480 --> 02:18:45,480
So the model,
if you have to fix that particular part,

2446
02:18:45,600 --> 02:18:47,840
you don't need to fix it in
multiple places.

2447
02:18:48,120 --> 02:18:50,320
You just go in one place, right?

2448
02:18:50,400 --> 02:18:53,760
Just click one place,
fix it with this, implement

2449
02:18:53,760 --> 02:18:56,640
the rest of all the places
it will get fixed automatically.

2450
02:18:57,640 --> 02:18:58,680
First thing.

2451
02:18:58,920 --> 02:19:02,040
Second thing to do this,
what I have to do, I have to create

2452
02:19:02,040 --> 02:19:05,160
be just according to the classes
and then I need to put

2453
02:19:05,160 --> 02:19:08,680
all the new characters
belong to the particular class.

2454
02:19:09,040 --> 02:19:10,240
That's what we did.

2455
02:19:10,240 --> 02:19:13,280
I know when we created all Look,

2456
02:19:13,320 --> 02:19:17,280
there's the functions, everything,
how to use them, how to use them.

2457
02:19:17,280 --> 02:19:20,920
So first we had one web driver, which
is already available in common methods.

2458
02:19:21,120 --> 02:19:23,760
So we extend the properties
of common matters.

2459
02:19:24,600 --> 02:19:27,000
Once we extended the properties
of common methods.

2460
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:32,520
Here we use constructor to initialize
all these objects by be as constructor.

2461
02:19:32,520 --> 02:19:36,920
When we create the object constructor
it's been called automatically initialize

2462
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:37,440
the object.

2463
02:19:37,440 --> 02:19:39,840
We need to construct the constructor.

2464
02:19:40,240 --> 02:19:43,440
Now here we have to initialize
all the elements of the beach,

2465
02:19:43,560 --> 02:19:47,240
so we are using beach
to initialize elements in it anyways.

2466
02:19:47,640 --> 02:19:48,120
Right.

2467
02:19:48,120 --> 02:19:50,640
And the driver
we are taking from our common methods.

2468
02:19:50,880 --> 02:19:54,680
And this is strings for, this keyword
which is pointing to my current class.

2469
02:19:54,680 --> 02:19:55,760
The pointer one.

2470
02:19:55,760 --> 02:19:57,160
Right. Current plus.

2471
02:19:57,160 --> 02:19:59,800
That's
what we did for all the separate pages.

2472
02:20:00,360 --> 02:20:03,640
Whatever the screens
we do not application we created.

2473
02:20:03,640 --> 02:20:04,440
We just for this

2474
02:20:06,640 --> 02:20:07,280
instrument.

2475
02:20:07,280 --> 02:20:09,840
Yes, we
have to forget all the previous systems.

2476
02:20:09,840 --> 02:20:14,320
Just focus on this particular event
and create projects with this will be way

2477
02:20:14,360 --> 02:20:21,560
I'm telling you,
I know it's all about mindset.

2478
02:20:21,560 --> 02:20:23,000
If you think I can do it, you can.

2479
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:25,280
Do we believe you can do it?

2480
02:20:25,280 --> 02:20:31,000
It's very easy.

2481
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:32,160
All right.

2482
02:20:32,560 --> 02:20:38,160
Okay.

2483
02:20:38,160 --> 02:20:39,600
But you guys did me.

2484
02:20:39,600 --> 02:20:41,600
So, Aleks, is this clear?

2485
02:20:41,600 --> 02:20:43,640
Is this clear what I said?

2486
02:20:43,640 --> 02:20:46,840
And then we will create this object
and the bridge initializes

2487
02:20:47,160 --> 02:20:48,680
right from that object.

2488
02:20:48,680 --> 02:20:50,520
We can call on the locators.

2489
02:20:50,520 --> 02:20:51,480
It's correct.

2490
02:20:52,760 --> 02:20:54,840
So this is the part of your page object.

2491
02:20:54,840 --> 02:20:57,880
Model your design, Pretend through
which you don't need to create

2492
02:20:57,880 --> 02:21:01,840
so many objects or group projects
in creating such frameworks.

2493
02:21:01,840 --> 02:21:04,600
Yes, I got it.
You need to create frameworks like this.

2494
02:21:05,960 --> 02:21:08,840
Then it's like we are digital or risky.

2495
02:21:08,840 --> 02:21:12,120
It is not
that we just wanted to to go with.

2496
02:21:12,120 --> 02:21:21,720
No, we have to create this right?

2497
02:21:21,720 --> 02:21:25,720
Gazi, whatever I said is it's is late

2498
02:21:33,680 --> 02:21:34,320
under of that

2499
02:21:34,320 --> 02:21:41,480
which I already

2500
02:21:44,160 --> 02:21:45,360
super in this part.

2501
02:21:45,360 --> 02:21:46,680
Any question

2502
02:21:56,040 --> 02:21:58,720
just in beginning
change note what we can change

2503
02:21:58,720 --> 02:22:01,600
there it is just a table we can do it

2504
02:22:04,360 --> 02:22:05,240
let me go ahead

2505
02:22:05,240 --> 02:22:14,840
and need to rename.

2506
02:22:14,840 --> 02:22:32,120
I like.

2507
02:22:32,120 --> 02:22:35,000
Well right now it got changed every bit
automatically

2508
02:22:37,680 --> 02:22:38,480
not omit.

2509
02:22:38,480 --> 02:22:45,600
One important announcement is still there.

2510
02:22:45,600 --> 02:22:47,040
Is it the final step?

2511
02:22:47,040 --> 02:22:48,840
No. Subtle one sort of planning step.

2512
02:22:48,840 --> 02:22:52,040
We are going towards
the final step in two classes.

2513
02:22:52,040 --> 02:22:52,840
I need many months.

2514
02:22:52,840 --> 02:22:55,160
Do we need more hours?
Maybe 10 hours straight.

2515
02:22:55,160 --> 02:22:57,720
Good things now. See you guys.

2516
02:22:57,720 --> 02:23:01,960
Another important thing
that will catch your attention.

2517
02:23:01,960 --> 02:23:05,240
Then we How many times we performed Click
Method Doors and Kismet.

2518
02:23:05,840 --> 02:23:10,640
How many things?

2519
02:23:10,640 --> 02:23:11,880
How many times?

2520
02:23:11,880 --> 02:23:14,040
Hundred times, right? Hundreds of times.

2521
02:23:14,400 --> 02:23:17,320
You're calling this dark click
methods go dark.

2522
02:23:17,320 --> 02:23:19,640
Same keys. But so, so many things. Right.

2523
02:23:19,880 --> 02:23:21,120
And also one more thing.

2524
02:23:21,120 --> 02:23:23,600
If you observed,
we are not waiting for elements.

2525
02:23:24,320 --> 02:23:28,000
So if you are not waiting for the elements
that are simply using trader sleep,

2526
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:32,120
which is not a good option right?

2527
02:23:32,120 --> 02:23:32,360
Right.

2528
02:23:32,360 --> 02:23:34,880
Guys, if you're using trader
sleep, it's not a good approach.

2529
02:23:35,400 --> 02:23:37,520
We need to fix all of this because

2530
02:23:38,360 --> 02:23:40,480
remember, in our framework

2531
02:23:40,760 --> 02:23:44,400
we are not supposed to call this dart
click method from stadium everything.

2532
02:23:45,200 --> 02:23:48,240
What we will do,
we will write this click method one place

2533
02:23:48,760 --> 02:23:54,000
and we will simply automated concept
of polymorphic method overwriting We will

2534
02:23:54,040 --> 02:23:57,840
create saved is method in one place
and then we will simply override.

2535
02:23:58,200 --> 02:23:59,760
So next time the same circles.

2536
02:23:59,760 --> 02:24:01,160
But they're going to change the

2537
02:24:01,160 --> 02:24:05,160
negative quality, diluting the quality,
the look in the same method

2538
02:24:05,160 --> 02:24:09,360
we want implicit
we find call implicit wake method.

2539
02:24:09,360 --> 02:24:11,120
If you want to change that name right,

2540
02:24:11,120 --> 02:24:14,240
just change the name in one place
integrated to your project.

2541
02:24:14,240 --> 02:24:17,960
Whenever you call this implicit method,
then we will come up.

2542
02:24:18,240 --> 02:24:21,240
No, no copy paste, no copy paste, nothing.

2543
02:24:21,240 --> 02:24:24,400
We are going to write those dynamic
functions, right?

2544
02:24:24,680 --> 02:24:29,960
We are going to write those
two dynamic function. So

2545
02:24:32,600 --> 02:24:33,560
got it.

2546
02:24:33,560 --> 02:24:37,080
And after they will call are screenshots
method straight.

2547
02:24:37,200 --> 02:24:39,560
So the screenshot we take with them,
the execution,

2548
02:24:39,560 --> 02:24:41,840
it will give us the results.

2549
02:24:41,840 --> 02:24:44,080
Then we need all the screenshots
in one place.

2550
02:24:44,080 --> 02:24:45,760
We put all of them in one place.

2551
02:24:45,760 --> 02:24:50,360
These all are the things we will create
then when we execute our project.

2552
02:24:50,400 --> 02:24:50,600
Right?

2553
02:24:50,600 --> 02:24:53,040
Right now
we are executing our project from here.

2554
02:24:53,600 --> 02:24:56,520
I will tell you how to execute
your project even when you don't.

2555
02:24:56,560 --> 02:25:02,680
During DTG, we will execute your project
with our intelligent an entire project.

2556
02:25:02,680 --> 02:25:05,400
With our intelligent,
we can override the parameters.

2557
02:25:05,400 --> 02:25:07,600
Without intelligent
they're not. So we will see.

2558
02:25:08,040 --> 02:25:13,440
All right.

2559
02:25:13,440 --> 02:25:16,880
So the starting point was
you were executing every single class

2560
02:25:17,160 --> 02:25:20,200
nowadays,
including from one point in intelligent.

2561
02:25:20,200 --> 02:25:23,600
After some time you will execute from one
find in intelligent.

2562
02:25:23,800 --> 02:25:27,760
After that you will execute
without engaging in the next two stages.

2563
02:25:27,840 --> 02:25:30,840
Whenever you do that, your system,
your code automatically

2564
02:25:30,840 --> 02:25:33,920
get executed there. Also, we show you.

2565
02:25:34,280 --> 02:25:40,920
All right,

2566
02:25:40,920 --> 02:25:44,080
a note that is bit initialize
that is right related to the object.

2567
02:25:44,080 --> 02:25:45,600
That's why it is under the steps

2568
02:25:49,360 --> 02:25:50,640
nozzle. No.

2569
02:25:50,640 --> 02:25:50,920
Do you

2570
02:25:50,920 --> 02:25:54,440
think that I will be able to complete
all this explanation in just 10 minutes?

2571
02:25:54,680 --> 02:26:02,240
Today? Yes.

2572
02:26:02,240 --> 02:26:05,200
Yes. Correct. Correct.

2573
02:26:05,520 --> 02:26:06,160
So I'm

2574
02:26:06,840 --> 02:26:10,760
not sure I believe

2575
02:26:16,640 --> 02:26:20,800
it's already raised any questions for me.

2576
02:26:20,800 --> 02:26:24,640
I know it's part

2577
02:26:26,400 --> 02:26:27,480
nice.

2578
02:26:27,680 --> 02:26:30,120
It's Linda. I know it's confusing. I know.

2579
02:26:30,560 --> 02:26:33,400
But I hope you guys understood everything.

2580
02:26:33,400 --> 02:26:34,800
Whatever the things I explained.

2581
02:26:34,800 --> 02:26:38,400
And it's not something
which is going beyond the above.

2582
02:26:38,760 --> 02:26:42,840
It's not something like that.

2583
02:26:42,840 --> 02:26:45,680
I this is what I have been doing
for the last eight years, Right?

2584
02:26:45,680 --> 02:26:47,960
So even if you ask me, even I'm sleepy.

2585
02:26:47,960 --> 02:26:52,760
And if you ask me every day,
little step by step, Lenny Kravitz.

2586
02:26:52,920 --> 02:27:02,920
Who is this?

2587
02:27:02,920 --> 02:27:08,080
No more.

2588
02:27:08,080 --> 02:27:14,840
Okay, now

2589
02:27:15,040 --> 02:27:22,280
who's listening?

2590
02:27:22,280 --> 02:27:25,160
It's for the nice.

2591
02:27:25,720 --> 02:27:27,520
If I want an answer that are going to

2592
02:27:35,240 --> 02:27:36,480
not to be honest.

2593
02:27:36,480 --> 02:27:39,240
They are all gorgeous.

2594
02:27:39,240 --> 02:27:40,160
They might be.

2595
02:27:40,160 --> 02:27:40,880
I don't know.

2596
02:27:40,880 --> 02:27:44,320
I never find alternates.

2597
02:27:44,440 --> 02:27:46,480
So this is all from my side
or to this class.

2598
02:27:46,480 --> 02:27:49,160
I think I'm done from my side

2599
02:27:49,160 --> 02:27:49,720
if you guys have.
