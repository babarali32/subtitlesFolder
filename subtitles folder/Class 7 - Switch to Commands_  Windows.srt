1
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,360
All right, guys, let's get started.

2
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,120
I think we have enough people already.

3
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:21,920
All right.

4
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,480
Good morning, everybody.

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,400
Always everybody doing, guys

6
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,640
as everybody feeling what's going on.

7
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,200
Everyone is good.

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,720
I hope everyone completed the homework.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,560
I'm good.

10
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,120
Thank you.

11
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:48,960
Okay.

12
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,080
Any issues with the homework, guys

13
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,920
that we went through?

14
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,440
Any. Any issues

15
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,840
with the topics that we've covered before?

16
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,480
All good.

17
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,040
Hopefully.

18
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,560
Okay, good.

19
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,040
So let's do a recap

20
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,040
of what we've done

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,440
in the last class.

22
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,640
Okay.

23
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,480
What did we cover?

24
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,440
Last class, guys?

25
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:28,400
Okay.

26
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,680
Well covered alerts and frames. Right.

27
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,080
Okay,
So what do we know about alerts, guys?

28
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,320
What is an alert?

29
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,680
It's a pop up notification, right?

30
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,480
Okay.

31
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,680
What does it do?

32
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,160
So it's a notification or a pop up
right on the web?

33
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,560
On the Web page. What does it do, guys?

34
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,400
It takes our

35
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,960
focus away from the main page, right?

36
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,560
It informs it about something
or asks for an input.

37
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,200
It takes the focus from our main page.

38
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,680
Okay, good.

39
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,720
What kind of.

40
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,280
And we can't do anything
until we close it, right?

41
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,560
Or until we handle it.

42
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,520
Okay,
so how many types of alerts do we know?

43
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,800
Guys?

44
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,840
Three types of.

45
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,640
Okay, so we've got

46
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,840
Web based alerts.

47
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,440
Right.

48
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,360
JavaScript alerts and Windows
based alerts.

49
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,400
Right.

50
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,080
Okay.

51
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,520
So how do we handle the Web based
alerts, guys?

52
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,600
We can simply inspected.

53
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,080
Right.

54
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,800
Because it takes the focus
from the main page,

55
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:14,840
but we don't have to switch to it or
we don't have to use any different tools.

56
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,160
Right.

57
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,720
So we're simply inspected
because it's a part of our main page

58
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,960
and we don't need to switch to it.

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,520
Right. Okay, good.

60
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,000
What about the Windows based alerts, guys?

61
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,640
How do we handle those?

62
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,480
We cannot write by using Sylvania.

63
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,840
We won't be able to handle the Windows
based alerts.

64
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,400
Okay. All right, good.

65
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,720
So now let's get into the JavaScript
alerts, guys.

66
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,440
How do we handle those

67
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,120
using the methods?

68
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,040
Okay.

69
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,960
How do we handle

70
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,840
JavaScript alerts in selenium?

71
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,720
Switch to it.

72
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,240
Except dismiss this for that.

73
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,840
What do we use guys

74
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,680
using switch method?

75
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,560
Okay. What else, guys?

76
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,120
I think I put it in the notes
as an interview question last time.

77
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,200
If I'm not mistaken,
we use an alert interface right?

78
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,880
To handle the JavaScript alert.

79
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,600
In selenium, we use alert interface.

80
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:38,480
Right.

81
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:44,120
So using alert interface,
then switching to that alert, accepting,

82
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,160
dismissing, right, getting the text or

83
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,200
depending on what kind of alert
it is with handle that alert.

84
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:51,840
Right.

85
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,440
So how many types of JavaScript
alerts do we know about guys?

86
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,240
Three types.

87
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,200
Okay.

88
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,760
What are those three types?

89
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,480
Simple Alert.

90
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,520
Confirmation alert and prompt.

91
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,720
Alert. Right.

92
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,200
Okay.

93
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,240
What can we do in the simple alert, guys?

94
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,880
We can just click.

95
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,040
Okay. What else?

96
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,160
Anything else
we can do in the Simple alert? Guys

97
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,680
now or. Yes.

98
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,760
So some people say get attacks.

99
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,560
Is it.

100
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,920
Can we do.

101
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,520
Can we get the text from the simple alert

102
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:54,120
guys or no.

103
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,120
Why not? Guys?

104
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,640
Why can we get the text
from the simple alert?

105
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,760
So if I click in here,

106
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,360
why can't I get this one?

107
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,360
It's a simple alert.

108
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:12,880
Right.

109
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,920
So that means we can get

110
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,760
the text from the simple alert as well.

111
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:19,920
Okay.

112
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,760
If we don't

113
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,640
if we didn't do it in the last class,
guys, that doesn't mean we can not do it.

114
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,320
Okay.

115
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,160
So you need to pay attention
on what we've got on the message.

116
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,200
If you have a message,
you can have, you can get the text.

117
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,120
Okay.

118
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,320
All right.

119
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,400
What about the confirmation alert, guys?

120
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,640
What can we do in there?

121
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,200
Cancel or click. Okay.

122
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:51,120
Can we get the text, guys?

123
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,320
We can get the text from there
as well. Right.

124
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,240
Okay, good.

125
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:55,760
All right.

126
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,960
What about the prompt alert

127
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,040
and the prompt alert?

128
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,280
We can enter the text,

129
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,440
send keys, accept or dismiss.

130
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:09,880
Right.

131
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,120
And can we get the text?

132
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,240
Guys?

133
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,760
So if I click on the prompt alert

134
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,120
and if I get the text here,
which text is it

135
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,840
going to return me?

136
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,760
Enter your name.

137
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,760
Right. Okay, good.

138
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,720
All right.

139
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,760
Okay.

140
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,520
So let's jump to the let's jump
to the frame scores.

141
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,200
Okay. What do we know about frames, guys?

142
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:52,040
What is the frame?

143
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,320
Frame?

144
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,880
It's like separate pages. Okay.

145
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,120
Nested web page.

146
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,560
Okay.

147
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,960
An independent window in our web page.

148
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,120
Good frames. A separate window. Okay.

149
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,960
So frame is is an email inside?

150
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,520
Another email, right?
Okay. That's very good.

151
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:21,360
Okay, So it's a separate
and an independent window in a web page.

152
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,560
Right.

153
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,960
So it allows developers
to present different, different

154
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,160
or multiple views in the same page.

155
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,640
Right. Okay.

156
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,280
So how how can we interact

157
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,840
or how can we handle the frames?

158
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,480
How many ways can we actually interact
with frames, guys?

159
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,040
Three ways.

160
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,320
Which are

161
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,280
set by index, by name

162
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,800
or ID and by web element.

163
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,040
Right. Okay. That's very good.

164
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:07,600
Okay, So in order to handle those
or to interact with the frames

165
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,880
by index name
or ID or web element, what else

166
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:19,320
do we need to do?

167
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,240
We need to switch, right?

168
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,880
We need to switch to the frames

169
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,440
so that we can interact with the elements
inside that.

170
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,760
Okay.

171
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,600
So what if

172
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,280
I switch into the frame

173
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,720
and then I want to interact
with these elements?

174
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,960
Guys on the very top?

175
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:45,360
What I need to do,

176
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,080
we need to switch
back to the default content.

177
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,440
Right?

178
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,840
So you have to manually switch
inside the frame

179
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,440
and get outside of the frame.

180
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,800
Okay.

181
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,760
All right. Any questions, guys?

182
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,600
Any questions on how to handle alerts or

183
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,720
how to handle frames?

184
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,200
Okay, All clear.

185
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,400
It's good. Okay.

186
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,800
So today, guys, what we going to be doing
today

187
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,600
is we will be going over

188
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,040
the windows.

189
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,400
Okay.

190
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,360
We will be going how to handle
multiple windows

191
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,600
or multiple tabs in the inside the crawl.

192
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,840
Okay.

193
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,560
So what I want you to do today,

194
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,600
guys, is try not to type, okay?

195
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,520
Try to listen.

196
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,960
What I'm going to explain
because it's going to get a little bit

197
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,000
a little bit confused in the middle.

198
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:48,920
Okay.

199
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,640
So that's why

200
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:53,760
I want you guys to listen first
and then you can type your code any time.

201
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,880
I'll give you time. Okay.

202
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,440
Is that good, guys? I hope that's good.

203
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,920
And let's get started.

204
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,640
Right.

205
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,120
Okay,
so let me go back to the intelligence.

206
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,840
I'm going to create a new

207
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:17,240
note file.

208
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,680
Are we?

209
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,480
We're almost there, guys.

210
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,120
It's seventh class.

211
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,200
We've got, like,
four more or something. And then.

212
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,520
Then we're going to be done

213
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,560
total.

214
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,040
I'm not sure.

215
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,720
I think total is 11 or 12.

216
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,280
Yes, I'll try to push the code
as much as possible.

217
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:55,680
Okay, guys, today, because you guys
are going to be listening to

218
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,520
this and not typing.

219
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,560
All right, guys.

220
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,000
So handling

221
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,080
multiple windows.

222
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,880
Okay.

223
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,560
So did anyone first of all, didn't
want to do a research on how to handle

224
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,240
multiple Windows and selenium guys?

225
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,040
Okay.

226
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,360
What do you know

227
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,680
about how do we handle

228
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,520
multiple windows in selenium?

229
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,200
Okay, a little bit.

230
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,440
Okay. Let's see, guys.

231
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,040
See what?

232
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:35,440
You guys.

233
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,920
Fine.

234
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,240
Window handles really good.

235
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,640
What else? Get window handles

236
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,680
three commands.

237
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,000
Get handle handles.

238
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,720
Okay, that's fine. Good.

239
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,920
Using the iterator.

240
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,320
Okay. Sounds good, guys.

241
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,360
So in order for us to

242
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,600
to handle multiple windows,
we will be using two different methods.

243
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,640
Okay.

244
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:10,840
One of them is get window handle,
and the other one is get window handles.

245
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:11,840
Okay.

246
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,160
And I'll explain to you

247
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,880
when to use which one.

248
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,480
And I'll explain to you
what the window handler is.

249
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,760
Okay.

250
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,760
In order to handle

251
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,920
multiple windows,

252
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,440
we will be using

253
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,600
get a window handle

254
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,040
method and get window

255
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,120
handles.

256
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:43,800
Okay.

257
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:48,160
So obviously, get window handler
was going to get you a single handle

258
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,400
and get window handles is going to get you
multiple handles.

259
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,200
Okay.

260
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,120
So what is a window handle?

261
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,080
Window handle is a unique ID

262
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,360
that holds that address of the window.

263
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,040
Okay. Or a tab.

264
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:11,720
So it is approximately
or consists of 40 alphanumeric characters.

265
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,720
Okay.

266
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,640
So basically,
when I go in here, so let's say

267
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,400
I have a chrome in here
and we navigate it to this web page.

268
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,600
So this tab will have its own unique I.D.,

269
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,120
which is called a window handle. Okay.

270
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,640
We don't see it here.

271
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,200
It's behind the scenes.

272
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,960
But we will be printing those window
handles inside our console

273
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,040
so that you can
so that you can see how it looks like.

274
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,800
Okay. But here.

275
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,920
No, that. Guys, any tab you open

276
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,680
in the Chrome

277
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,360
browser or whatever browser
you're using any tab you open.

278
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,720
It will have its own unique address,

279
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,840
which is called window handle.

280
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,840
Any questions on that, guys?

281
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,040
So window handle

282
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,680
right is a

283
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,920
unique I.D.

284
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,480
that shows the

285
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:27,600
address of the window or a tab.

286
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,080
Okay.

287
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,160
And it is approximately

288
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,640
is approximately 40

289
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,520
of the numeric

290
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,960
or their I.D..

291
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,680
Okay.

292
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,800
So it holds a pretty long I.D..

293
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,760
Okay. So we'll take a look at that.

294
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,000
All right.

295
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,440
So now this is enough from the theory
that we need to know right now.

296
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,360
So now we need to dive
into the actual implementation.

297
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,720
Okay.

298
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,480
So what I'm going to do

299
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:15,600
is create another package,

300
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,600
and I'm going to create another

301
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,800
class.

302
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:27,880
Okay.

303
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,960
Name it as simple window handling.

304
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,640
Okay.

305
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,520
And what I'm going to do with the main

306
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,120
method in here. So.

307
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,680
So what we going to be doing now, guys,

308
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,760
let me open up
that page that we will be interacting

309
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,840
with all.

310
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,400
Okay.

311
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,800
So what we're going to do now, guys,

312
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,120
we will be navigating to this Web
page in here.

313
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:00,720
And what I'm going to do
is click on this help in here.

314
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,760
Okay.

315
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:05,640
So if I click help in here,
you can see that once I click that,

316
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,080
we're going to have a new tab
open up for us.

317
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,320
Okay.

318
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,200
So and then what
we need, what we're going to be doing,

319
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,000
we will be switching
between two different tabs

320
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,960
and we will be performing different,
different actions.

321
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,680
Okay. Any questions, guys?

322
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,440
Before we get started?

323
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,520
Okay.

324
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:29,880
All right.

325
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,520
Let's do this right.

326
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:37,960
Let me like this one.

327
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,320
That's it.

328
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,080
Let's get this copied

329
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,720
in here.

330
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,400
And I need the.

331
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:59,080
This one of

332
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,440
zero.

333
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,200
Okay. So this is our URL.

334
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,920
We set up the properties when we launched.

335
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,560
The browser would navigate to that URL.
Right.

336
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,160
What do I need to do in here, guys?

337
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:24,440
What is my next step?

338
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,640
So find the web element.

339
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,160
Right?

340
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,200
Find the web element
that I will be interacting with.

341
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,400
All right. Let's go here.

342
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,440
So we navigate it here.

343
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,440
So now let me inspect this page.

344
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,560
And what

345
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,760
I want to do, I want to click on this.

346
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:49,360
Right.

347
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,960
What what is the locator that I can use
in here?

348
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,120
Guys, the easiest one

349
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,600
text for Xbox.

350
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,920
But if I if I don't want to use Xbox in

351
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:11,720
here, I get.

352
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,480
Okay, what else

353
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,640
Address.

354
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,240
What is the locator, guys?

355
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,680
What is the locator
that I can use in here?

356
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,160
Which is the easiest one.

357
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,320
This is a trap.

358
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,680
What about link text? Guys?

359
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,000
Did we forget about the link?

360
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,440
Text?

361
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,640
Can we use the link text in here?

362
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:48,720
Guys?

363
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:50,960
Easy. Right.

364
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,920
So you can use the link text.

365
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,120
And you just need this text, right?

366
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,560
Yep. You guys did forget about this.

367
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,360
Let's not do that. Okay.

368
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,920
So I know there's a lot of stuff.

369
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,200
I know there's a lot of

370
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,280
there's a lot of locators in there.

371
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:13,680
But try to see the optimized way
to solve the problem.

372
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,520
Okay.

373
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,680
So we're going to be using a link
text in here.

374
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,920
So obviously, you can do it with X path,

375
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,320
probably since we were doing everything

376
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,120
by Express
so that we have a lot of practice.

377
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,760
You guys forgot
about the rest of the locators.

378
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,080
Okay, so.

379
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,400
But it's okay.

380
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,280
All right. So what I will do

381
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,040
web element

382
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,200
help link is equal to driver

383
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,120
sign element by

384
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,520
where is that link text?

385
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,440
Right.
And of course the link text in here.

386
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,640
Okay, so I have this.

387
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,400
Okay.

388
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,920
But before I perform any action.

389
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,560
So let's perform
an action as well in here.

390
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,360
It doesn't really matter.

391
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,560
So help link

392
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,360
right

393
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:05,840
click.

394
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:06,640
Okay.

395
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:12,080
So we're clicking on that
and then our new tab is open

396
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:17,080
right before I go ahead,
find that element and click on that right.

397
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:23,040
What I want to do, Guy,
I want to have the handle

398
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,320
of the main page that I just navigated to.

399
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,640
Okay.

400
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:32,040
So what I'm going to do
before I find that element and before

401
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,800
I click on that element, what I will do,

402
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,720
I'll simply go ahead and do driver

403
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,040
the get window handle.

404
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,600
Okay.

405
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,640
So when I do this,
it will automatically go ahead

406
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,920
and capture the address

407
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:54,040
for that exact tab that I just navigate.

408
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,400
Okay.

409
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,040
Is that clear?

410
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:00,960
Guys?

411
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,040
And since I set that,
it is an alphanumeric value, Right?

412
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,560
So where do we store this, guys? Exactly.

413
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,920
That's the question for you guys.

414
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:14,240
What am I getting in return?

415
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,640
I'm getting a simple string.

416
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,880
Right? So let's do this.

417
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,480
We can do main page

418
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:28,200
handle is equal to driver dot get window
handler.

419
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:28,760
Right.

420
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:32,560
So what I'm going to do in here, I'm
going to go ahead and print it out for you

421
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:38,520
so that you guys can see how actually
this window handle looks like.

422
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,440
Okay, so main page in here.

423
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:42,960
Okay.

424
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,040
So let me run this.

425
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,720
Actually, let's not click on the Help yet.

426
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,400
Let's just see how our window handle

427
00:22:51,680 --> 00:23:00,680
looks like.

428
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:10,640
Okay, I'm on.

429
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,360
All right.

430
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,240
So we're navigating it to this page.

431
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,520
So let's go ahead
and take a look at our console right now.

432
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,080
So you can see here, guys, it's very long

433
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,560
alphanumeric value in here.

434
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,400
Okay.

435
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,520
So we don't see this on the on
the browser.

436
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,520
Whenever we're doing something manually,
we can only see it

437
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,880
whenever we are doing some scripting.

438
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,400
And whenever you get that window handle

439
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,320
and print it out,
only then you will see it.

440
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:46,320
But most of the time, guys, you won't be
you won't need to print this out.

441
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:50,040
You just need to get the window
handle and perform different actions

442
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:53,360
because you will be moving
through the different different

443
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,640
tabs.

444
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,440
Yes. It's used for tracking.

445
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,200
Yes. Okay.

446
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,200
Yes. It's good for you guys
to see visually how everything looks

447
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,880
because you won't really understand
if you don't see it.

448
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,520
Right.

449
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,640
So if you just write the code and run it
and it runs fine,

450
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,600
that's not the good thing. But

451
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,720
I tried to visually
show you so that you guys can see,

452
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:28,640
okay, okay, 32 is fine.

453
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,200
I said approximately 40, right, guys,
It doesn't have to be 40.

454
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,320
It's almost 40. So.

455
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,120
All right,
so we have the main page window handle.

456
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,320
We captured it. We started in the

457
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,400
what's called
in the string variable in here.

458
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,240
So let me

459
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,880
uncomment this one.

460
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,160
Okay.

461
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,240
So now what I will do in here.

462
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,680
So let's run this.

463
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,960
Okay, So let me run this

464
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,840
and this is going to open up a different

465
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,440
it should open up a different tab, right?

466
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:21,840
Well, this is slow today.

467
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,040
Okay. Running

468
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,560
here. There we go.

469
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:30,560
So it open up the second tab in here.

470
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,960
So what I need to do in here,

471
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,600
I need to have all the tabs

472
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,280
inside my script

473
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,360
so that I can keep switching between them.

474
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,760
Okay, so this window handle
that we just captured,

475
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,880
it's only one window
handle from the main page, Right?

476
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:57,200
So I'm going to need all the window
handles

477
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,960
so that I can keep count

478
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,800
or I can keep manipulating them,
or I can keep switching,

479
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,400
or I can close them
whatever action I want to do.

480
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,720
Okay, So the main purpose
of having the window handles

481
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,440
is to keep track of the tabs

482
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:19,560
and to switch through those tabs.

483
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,520
Is that clear?

484
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,840
Guys, any questions?

485
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,960
Okay, so right now in here, guys,

486
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,640
what we have, we have two different tabs.

487
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:36,920
Right.

488
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,200
So what I want to do in here,

489
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,720
I want to capture all the tabs

490
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,960
that I have right now on my session.

491
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,360
Okay,
So I open up when I open up a new browser.

492
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,240
What?

493
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,560
What is this, guys?

494
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,480
This is my new session.

495
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:59,040
Okay, so if I closed this the previous
one, it's a completely different session.

496
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:05,080
Okay, so whatever.

497
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:10,680
Whatever amount of window handles
I have in the session,

498
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:14,720
I want to store them inside the container.

499
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,160
Okay, so the window handle, it changes
each time.

500
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,440
It's not going to change, guys. So

501
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:27,120
this let's say I open this is to

502
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,960
tabs that open. Right.

503
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:35,720
So the one that just printed out, it's
going to be the same

504
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:40,680
through out the same session
throughout the same execution.

505
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:41,880
Okay.

506
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,360
But when you complete your execution

507
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:50,400
and then you open up another Chrome
browser, it's going to start a new session

508
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,600
and it's going to be completely new tab

509
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,560
and it's going to be completely new window
handle.

510
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:56,920
Okay.

511
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,280
So this tab has its own window handle

512
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:04,600
and this tab has its own window handle.

513
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:05,640
Okay.

514
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,720
Is that clear? Guys

515
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,920
know that

516
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:21,120
the window handles,
they change with the session as well.

517
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,360
Okay, so you open up a new session

518
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,680
and you tab is going to change your the.

519
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,040
It's going to change the window handle.

520
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:34,560
Okay, So if you open up another session
for the same exact website,

521
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,720
it will change the window handle as well.

522
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,840
Okay. So it is always dynamic.

523
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,160
You don't really know
what kind of window handle you have.

524
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,240
So right now.

525
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,760
Okay, guys, since I want to grab all the

526
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,640
all the tabs
and store them inside the container,

527
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,600
what I am going to do, I'm going to use
get window handles method.

528
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,760
Okay.

529
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,320
So driver, the get window handles

530
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:14,520
which returns us What goes in here?

531
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,800
Is it returning to stream? Guys

532
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,800
get window handles.

533
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,080
It's returning a set of strings.

534
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,480
Right.

535
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,920
Okay, so what?

536
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:31,840
Why is it not returning me a
a list of strings?

537
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,640
Guys,

538
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,560
any guesses on this?

539
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,800
Why am I getting a set of strings?

540
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,360
Isn't it easier to have

541
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,920
less stuff?

542
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,200
It should be unique.

543
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,840
Absolutely. Right.

544
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:51,440
Because set will not allow duplications.

545
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,360
Good.

546
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,960
Okay, so what I will do in here,

547
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:58,800
since I'm using get window
handles, what I'm going to do,

548
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,160
going to have a

549
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,440
set of strings and say all

550
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,280
window handles.

551
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:08,880
Okay.

552
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,200
Is equal to driver that get window
handles.

553
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,560
Okay, So there we go.

554
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,880
So now what I did,

555
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,320
I got all the all the window
handles right.

556
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,640
And I stored them inside the set.

557
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,640
Okay. So

558
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,680
whenever I click

559
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,000
on the help link in here

560
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,080
and it opens up a new tab,
what I am doing here,

561
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:45,560
I am grabbing those two tabs
and storing them in the set of strings.

562
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,440
Okay, so this is going to do it
automatically because it's

563
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,880
looking for those handle
on the active session.

564
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,040
Okay. Is that clear, guys?

565
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,920
Any questions?

566
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,200
Okay, good.

567
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:05,560
All right.

568
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:09,360
So right now, what I want to do,
I want to print out

569
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,640
how many tabs I have inside my console.

570
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,760
Okay. So what? I will do

571
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,880
the print line right?

572
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,000
So all window handles.

573
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,680
How how can I see how many of those tabs

574
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:29,040
I have guys that side. Right.

575
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:40,160
Easy to record.

576
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,320
Or if you if you open up a new one

577
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,680
demo, then. Is that your question? Okay.

578
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,520
After this.

579
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,360
Okay, So.

580
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:54,080
So in this case, it will not record it
because what you did,

581
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,280
you only captured the once available
for you.

582
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:00,680
Exactly.

583
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,560
You would have to capture

584
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,800
all the window handles again.

585
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,560
Okay.

586
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,920
You don't have to create
a new set of strings.

587
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:12,720
You can use the same exact variable
that you have in here.

588
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:20,520
Okay.

589
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,000
Okay.

590
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,880
Any other questions, guys

591
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,200
will handle

592
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,280
for the first window
and then use it from demo.

593
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,360
Yes, you can do that.

594
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,560
Yeah.

595
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,920
Declared in the beginning.

596
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,760
Oh, so are you.

597
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,160
Are you
guys talking about the main page handle

598
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:13,840
or you are talking about line 23.

599
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,840
Oh Oscar each tab. Yes.

600
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:20,400
So you have to do
you have to do this exact same. Yes.

601
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,920
So to capture all the handles. Yes.

602
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,960
You need to do that. Okay.

603
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:30,400
So now, guys, let me tell you how
this is works in real world.

604
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:35,640
So whenever you join a company or in it in

605
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,400
and you working on the application, Right.

606
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:43,720
So you won't be working on too many tabs

607
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,040
because it doesn't really make sense.

608
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:51,520
So to open one tab
and then to open another one

609
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,360
and then after that another one
and then test another one.

610
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:54,960
Right.

611
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,280
So that doesn't really make sense for you
in terms of testing.

612
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,840
So what happens what happens in real,

613
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,680
real applications
that you navigate to one page,

614
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,320
you click on something
and it opens up a new page

615
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,720
and then you continue your work
on the second tab.

616
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,240
Okay.

617
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:21,480
So you don't have to open
multiple, multiple or what's called

618
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,280
multiple tabs

619
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,840
in order to work on some functionality.

620
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,200
Okay.
So this is not how it's going to work.

621
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:34,160
So most the most tabs or windows
you're going to be working on,

622
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:38,040
on a real application
is going to be two different tabs.

623
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,000
Okay.

624
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,800
And one of them,

625
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:43,360
whenever you switch to one of them,
you will be closing the first one.

626
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,800
Okay. So this is how it usually works.

627
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,360
So don't really

628
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,320
get scared if if I have five tabs.

629
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,080
If I have seven tabs, you won't have that.

630
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,600
Okay.

631
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,800
So the maximum amount of windows

632
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,800
or tabs you're going to have in

633
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,480
in your real
application is going to be two.

634
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,800
Okay.

635
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:13,920
Having our active session, if we open new
tabs, then we need to capture it again.

636
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:20,320
Exactly. Yes.

637
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,000
Yes. No need to save the second tab
because you're going to be closing it.

638
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,800
Okay, so I got this size right now
of my set of string.

639
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,600
So let me run this and let's see,
what are we going to

640
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:41,240
get in return?

641
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,920
Okay.

642
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,360
When here, opening up a new tab,
clicking on help.

643
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,440
Right.

644
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,480
And here you can see that it's number two.

645
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,560
So I have two window handles right now

646
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:04,320
stored inside the set of strings.

647
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,080
Okay.

648
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,120
Any questions, guys,

649
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:13,320
before I move forward?

650
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,960
Okay, good.

651
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,000
All right, So now, guys, what

652
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,840
How is it opening a new tap?

653
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,880
We're clicking on helpfully line 2021.

654
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,960
So if you click on the Help link, it's
going to open a new tab.

655
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,120
Okay, Right here.

656
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,560
So click on this.

657
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,120
It's going to open a new tab.

658
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:41,120
Okay, So now we know
we captured all the window handles.

659
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:46,320
Now we have
we know how many window handles

660
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,320
we have inside our set of strings.

661
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,280
Okay.

662
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,080
So what I need to do right now

663
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:57,720
in order for me to switch around
and manipulate those tabs,

664
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:02,000
what I need to do,
I need to iterate those tabs.

665
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,040
Okay.

666
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:07,160
So in this case, what I'm going to do,
I'm going to create an item later.

667
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,120
Okay, So what?

668
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,840
I'll do all window handles the

669
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,440
iterator

670
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,560
here. Okay.

671
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,720
So I need to the variable

672
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,240
click to greater

673
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,960
strings. Right.

674
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,680
To just to this and let's import this guy.

675
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,640
Okay.

676
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,760
So now what I'm trying to do,

677
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,920
I'm trying to iterate through each

678
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:40,560
and every tab that I have inside my set.

679
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,760
Okay, so now,

680
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,640
guys, I'm not going to be creating a
for a while loop in here,

681
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,480
but I'll show you how to do it one by one.

682
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:52,680
Okay.

683
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:57,280
So if you if you create a Y loop, it's
going to see if there is something next.

684
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,000
And then will be performing
some actions. Right.

685
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,640
So I want to show you the easy way
right now.

686
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,720
And then we will go to Advanced
Window Hand.

687
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,720
Okay.

688
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:11,440
So first of all, guys,
when I step forward inside my iterator,

689
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,440
so what am I going to have, guys?

690
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,800
So let's say
I have a set of strings, right?

691
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,040
I have a set of window handles.

692
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,560
So if I step forward,
what am I going to have?

693
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:32,840
Guys?

694
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,720
Any thoughts?

695
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,520
The first handle.

696
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,680
Right. Okay, So that's very good.

697
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:45,640
So if I step forward, I'm
going to have the first handle right.

698
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:49,560
So what I'm going to do my next

699
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:54,200
step is my first handle.

700
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:54,680
Right?

701
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,800
Where is my first handle right now, guys?

702
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:02,760
My first handle is the main page handle.

703
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,760
Okay.

704
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,360
So what I will do

705
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:11,560
my next step, I will say the main page

706
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,880
handle is my next step.

707
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:16,960
Okay.

708
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,720
And since we know that

709
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,200
there's two different tabs in here,

710
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,440
I need to create another handle.

711
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:32,440
Because whenever I am moving forward
the second time, I need a new handle.

712
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,760
Is that clear, guys?

713
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,640
I'm pretty sure this is.

714
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,240
This is the time that it's going to be
confusing a little bit, but that's fine.

715
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:42,960
Okay.

716
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,680
So I'm going to create a new string
and say

717
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,000
child handle, okay?

718
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:55,240
And I'm going to assign it
to my next step.

719
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,640
Okay.

720
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,400
So and then let me

721
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,840
just to print line the child handle.

722
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,360
Okay. All right, guys.

723
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,640
So let me explain it to you one more time.

724
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,440
Okay.

725
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,760
So line 27, what we're doing,
what we trying to do?

726
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,600
We're trying to iterate
through the tabs, right?

727
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,160
So the first step

728
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:25,440
that I'm going inside that set, guys,
what am I seeing?

729
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,280
The first thing

730
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,760
which handle

731
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,080
I am seeing guys

732
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,480
the main.

733
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:36,960
Right.

734
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:42,240
So that's why I am assigning
my first step to the main page handle.

735
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,920
Okay.

736
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:48,120
And then
since we know there's two different tabs,

737
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:51,600
I need to have another handle

738
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,000
so that I can step forward.

739
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,160
Okay.

740
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,760
Is that clear? Guys?

741
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,760
Any questions?

742
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,080
There should be Exactly.

743
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:04,280
There should be two different handles
for me

744
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,520
to step forward twice.

745
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,440
Any confusion in here, guys?

746
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,440
Okay.

747
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,800
Okay, good.

748
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,120
So now what I will do in here.

749
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,600
So I'm going to print the child handle.

750
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,680
That is fine.

751
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,000
So now what I need to do

752
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,840
since I opened up a new tab.

753
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:41,040
What I want to do,
I want to go back to my main page handle

754
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:51,360
so we could store.

755
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,640
Oh, that's the tricky part.

756
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,240
Okay, Blake,
I'm coming to your question right now.

757
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,040
Okay, I'm coming to your question.

758
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,960
We're already in main page

759
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,680
when we're not on the main page, Right?

760
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:14,760
So if I click on this, where am I going?

761
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,600
If I click on this, guys, I'm going to

762
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,280
the child page, right?

763
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:24,040
So what I need to do,
I need to switch back in here.

764
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,640
Okay.

765
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:30,000
So that's why I'm switching to the main.

766
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,560
So if there's a third handle,
we would like to do another child.

767
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,320
Exactly.

768
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,960
But right now, let's just keep it
simple, guys.

769
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,640
We two tabs.

770
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,160
We will be handling
four or five tabs after this.

771
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:46,560
So it's going to be it's
going to be a little bit different.

772
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,320
But let's keep it in two tabs right now
in here.

773
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:54,240
Okay.

774
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:54,840
All right.

775
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:58,760
So what I did step two times forward.

776
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,680
One of them is main page.

777
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,400
One of them is child hand.

778
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:07,080
Okay, so what I am doing here,
I am assigning

779
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,560
my next steps manually.

780
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,840
Okay, so my first step,
I'm saying it's main page,

781
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,600
and my second step is going to be my child
handle.

782
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:24,360
Okay, so now what I need to do
since we switched and we're seeing right.

783
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,880
Well, looking at the child page right now,
what I need to

784
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:31,520
do, I need to switch to the main. Okay.

785
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,440
So what I'm

786
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:37,560
going to do in here, I'm going to driver

787
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:42,280
that switch to that window.

788
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:43,200
Okay.

789
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:47,600
So inside the parentheses,
I am going to put I'm going to paste

790
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,200
a window handle of the page
that I want to switch to.

791
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:53,280
Okay.

792
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:58,280
So right now, the page that I want
to switch to is the main page handle.

793
00:43:58,920 --> 00:43:59,720
Okay.

794
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:06,240
And this is how I'm going to switch
back to the main page.

795
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,080
Okay.

796
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:12,360
So let me actually here,
give it a little bit of a pause

797
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:16,080
for 2 seconds so that we can see
what is going on on the Web page.

798
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:16,800
Okay.

799
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,280
So now what I will do
will go ahead and run

800
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,320
this.

801
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,440
No, you don't have to store it.

802
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:31,920
No, no, no.
You don't have to sort this one.

803
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:36,680
So what you are doing, you are simply
performing an action for your tab.

804
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,520
Okay.

805
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:41,760
Okay.

806
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,840
So we open up a new one.

807
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:45,720
2 seconds.

808
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:51,600
Now, what we did,
we switch back to the main page, Right?

809
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,120
So that's pretty cool, right, guys?

810
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:56,360
Okay, Nice.

811
00:44:56,360 --> 00:45:02,240
Okay, So now, guys,
any confusions in here?

812
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:05,120
If you want, I can go over this again.

813
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:09,440
Guys, How and why we're going.

814
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:15,600
Okay, let's quickly.

815
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,960
Seems like there are some people
who are confused right now.

816
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,240
Let's quickly go over it again. Okay.

817
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:25,120
So when I when I click on the help

818
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:27,880
link in here, what I did is

819
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,040
it opened up a new one,

820
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,720
a new tab, Right.

821
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:36,080
24, line 24.

822
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,480
What I did, I captured all

823
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,200
set of strengths.

824
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:42,760
Right.

825
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,880
And then on line 27,

826
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:49,320
what I did, I said, hey, okay,
I have a set of strengths.

827
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,960
So I want to iterate through them. Okay.

828
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:56,720
So I want to iterate through them,
but I don't want to do it with Luc.

829
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,720
I want to do it manually. Okay.

830
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,000
And then I said, Hey,
whenever I want to step first,

831
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:05,280
whenever I want to make my first move,

832
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:09,600
I want my first move to be my main page
handle.

833
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,120
Okay?

834
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:14,000
And whenever I make my second move,

835
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:18,960
I want this second move to be my child
handle.

836
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:20,440
Okay.

837
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:23,520
And then, since we opened up the new tab

838
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:28,120
and we're looking into my second tab right
now, what I did,

839
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,720
I switched back to the main page handle.

840
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:32,720
Okay.

841
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:36,840
And if you look at the console guys,
we have the child window handle as well.

842
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,720
Okay.

843
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:45,720
Switch method, which to any window.

844
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,280
Yes. Correct.

845
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:51,000
Yes. With a switch method,
you can switch to any window.

846
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,840
You can right.

847
00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:06,600
I mean, any window you have,
you won't be able to do it with indexes.

848
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:09,480
Okay. So.

849
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,280
So let's say you talking.

850
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,000
I think what you mean is let's say
you have five tabs from the first.

851
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,360
You want to jump on the fifth one,

852
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:17,760
right.

853
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,720
And not go through the one,
two, three, four.

854
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,320
Is that is that your question.

855
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:33,160
Andre.

856
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:33,760
Okay.

857
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,760
So in that case. Okay.

858
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:40,640
So if you have if you have a four loop,
I mean, one loop.

859
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,840
Okay.

860
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:45,400
If you have a wild loop in this case.

861
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,200
So I'll show you how this works.

862
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:51,840
So let's not if I explain it to you right
now, won't understand it.

863
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:56,840
So let's go over the second exercise
and then I'll explain that to you.

864
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:04,640
Okay.

865
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:07,080
No, they're not indexed.

866
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:10,320
So basically, what we're doing here,

867
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:14,160
we're going through each and every string.

868
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:20,000
Okay, guys,

869
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,520
we won't be going over the indexes.

870
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,160
We will go.

871
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:28,560
We're going through each and every window
handle.

872
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:36,440
Okay.

873
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,760
Yes. If in real,

874
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:43,240
real work,
you are going over to different tabs.

875
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,800
Yeah, I is fine.

876
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,280
I mean, we will be using iterator anyways.

877
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:51,840
Okay, so you're going to be using iterator
in the next example as well.

878
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:54,480
But we're going to be using it
with a loop. Okay.

879
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,400
So that's going to
be more advanced than that.

880
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:58,760
Okay.

881
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:03,120
So right now, what I want you to do, guys,
I want you to capture this logic,

882
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,760
because this is the easy logic.

883
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,800
Your assigning everything manually.

884
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:11,760
But now in the next example,
we will be dealing with different

885
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:14,480
windows.

886
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,480
And then there we will have
a little bit of confusion in there.

887
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,440
Okay.

888
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,720
Iterator control.
No, no, no, guys. Iterator.

889
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:30,760
If it can't handle only two tabs, whatever
tabs you have, it can handle it in here.

890
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,560
We have two tabs.

891
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:34,920
Okay.

892
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,120
Okay, guys.

893
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:41,880
So there is one more thing
that I want to show you guys.

894
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:45,120
Remember, guys, we talked about close

895
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:48,080
and quit
the difference between clothes and quit.

896
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:52,400
And I told you guys whenever we were
were going over the window handles.

897
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:55,280
You will see the better difference
in there.

898
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:56,280
Okay.

899
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,320
So what I'm going to do right now, guys,

900
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:02,280
I'm going to go ahead
and do driver that close

901
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:06,840
after I switch to the main page handle.

902
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,000
Okay.

903
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:11,160
So let me run this

904
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:17,920
and see what we're going to have

905
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,720
to go

906
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:30,120
open it up.

907
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:32,080
Go back.

908
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,240
But what happened, guys?

909
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:38,520
So it only closed the main page.

910
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,920
Okay. Why?

911
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:45,640
Because the focus of our selenium
is only on the main page.

912
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,000
And it.

913
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,720
And we used close instead of quit

914
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,120
and close only closes

915
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:57,200
the current tab that we are active on.

916
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:57,840
Right.

917
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:01,680
And quit is going to terminate
that whole session.

918
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:03,800
Okay.

919
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:08,080
No, you don't have to specify the window
handling here

920
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:11,280
because it close

921
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:16,200
doesn't accept any any arguments and close

922
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:19,200
will just close the tab that you are

923
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,320
currently working.

924
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:26,120
All right.

925
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:29,240
Any questions, guys?

926
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:35,400
Correct.

927
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:38,080
So you have to switch

928
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:42,160
to the window
that you want to close or perform

929
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:46,600
any actions,
because whenever you switch, you take your

930
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:51,520
you take your focus of selenium with you.

931
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:52,400
Okay.

932
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,440
So if you don't switch,
you won't be able to close that window.

933
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,040
Okay, guys.

934
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:00,040
So first, before you close any tabs,

935
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:04,400
you need to make sure that your your

936
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:09,280
your focus of selenium
is on that exact tab.

937
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:18,160
Okay. Yes.

938
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,240
If you use quit in here.

939
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:24,320
So driver

940
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,480
that quit

941
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:32,760
Now quit.

942
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:35,160
And let's run
this and see what's going to happen.

943
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:37,840
This is going to happen really fast.

944
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:38,560
I think.

945
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:41,680
So it's going to switch to the main page
and it's going to terminate

946
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:56,240
the whole session.

947
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:57,960
There we go.

948
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:00,200
So it terminated the whole session.

949
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:07,320
Okay.

950
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:29,840
Any questions, guys, please?

951
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,680
Okay, cool.

952
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:35,600
So let me

953
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,080
open up a new Java class.

954
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:59,520
And here and.

955
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:20,240
All right.

956
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:21,360
All right, guys.

957
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:25,000
So the next example,
what I'm going to be doing is we're going

958
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:31,000
to be navigating to this Web page
and we will be clicking on each

959
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,640
on each button in here.

960
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:38,040
So if I click on this, see, okay,
so it opens up

961
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:40,760
this guy

962
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,960
opens up this guy

963
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:47,240
and it opens up this guy.

964
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,840
So there's three different pages

965
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:54,480
on the ground Facebook pages for syntax.

966
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:56,120
All right.

967
00:54:56,120 --> 00:55:00,360
So we will be clicking on all of those
and then we will be switch it around

968
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:05,120
and we will be playing around
with those different windows.

969
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,200
Okay.

970
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:07,520
Is that clear?

971
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:11,360
Guys, any questions before we get started?

972
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:16,800
Okay, cool.

973
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:20,560
All right, so let's get this one

974
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:34,080
that the URL.

975
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:41,840
Okay.

976
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,240
So everything

977
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:47,040
okay?

978
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:51,240
So what I want to do first, guys,
I want to go ahead

979
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:57,000
and navigate to that page
and what I want to do right now.

980
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,800
I want to get the main page window
handle, guys.

981
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:01,600
Okay.

982
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:10,320
How would I do that?

983
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:17,040
Finding the element.

984
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:19,400
Now I need to get the main page

985
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:22,080
window handle dice.

986
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:25,640
Simple right driver

987
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,240
that get window handle

988
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:30,560
right.

989
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:34,640
And we can store it inside the string.

990
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,680
Do this right.

991
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:40,960
Okay. So now what I want to do?

992
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:45,480
I want to find all the elements first

993
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:49,800
and then click on those.

994
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:52,360
Okay, So now let's

995
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:55,320
go back in here for let's inspect this.

996
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:56,520
All right.

997
00:56:57,120 --> 00:57:02,560
So what I want to do,
I want to find this element first.

998
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:05,480
Okay.

999
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:07,800
Let's see here.

1000
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:14,400
What do we want to use in here, guys?

1001
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,240
Like text, Right? Easy.

1002
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:19,040
So let's go use the link Text.

1003
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:21,120
Okay. So

1004
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:30,440
I think it was the Instagram, Right?

1005
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:33,000
Okay, second

1006
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:36,320
button for the

1007
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,840
element link text

1008
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:44,240
pasted in here.

1009
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:46,040
Okay.

1010
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:48,600
And then

1011
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:53,640
the second one is here.

1012
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:57,840
Can use the same way

1013
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,280
for elements.

1014
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:07,280
It's Facebook

1015
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:11,600
button

1016
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:20,240
element by link text.

1017
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:23,040
Right.

1018
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:26,760
And then the third button we have here

1019
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:30,920
is follow Instagram and Facebook.

1020
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:33,120
This is a neat tag.

1021
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:38,160
So that

1022
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:02,560
everyone is clear.

1023
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:05,920
What I have done from line 17 to 19.

1024
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:16,320
All right, guys, any questions in here?

1025
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:18,880
Okay, good.

1026
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:19,240
All right.

1027
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:24,960
So we identified all the elements
were located, all those elements, Right.

1028
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:28,000
So what what do we need to do here?

1029
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:30,560
We just need to perform a simple click.

1030
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:32,080
All right.

1031
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,680
So let's go ahead and do this

1032
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:46,720
quick.

1033
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:48,960
And then

1034
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:53,960
click.

1035
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:55,200
Okay.

1036
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:57,840
So we have this.

1037
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:00,400
So what I am going to do right now,

1038
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:04,520
let me run this and see what
what we have on our page.

1039
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:05,040
Right.

1040
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:22,440
So running this.

1041
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:24,400
All right, let's see.

1042
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:28,480
This seems like no such element
exception, guys.

1043
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:32,000
Unable
to look at the element with the link text.

1044
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:32,600
Right.

1045
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:34,320
What's wrong, guys?

1046
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:37,320
So my link, that is fine.

1047
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:40,440
Any idea what is going on in here,

1048
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:48,720
guys?

1049
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:52,560
So my link text follow on Instagram.

1050
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:55,560
So that means this is not my selenium

1051
01:00:55,560 --> 01:01:05,040
is not finding this.

1052
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:06,680
I didn't open a tab. Right.

1053
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:08,400
This is the first element, guys.

1054
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:11,160
I what I did, I navigated there.

1055
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:14,040
I tried to find that element.

1056
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:16,440
I didn't even click that

1057
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:19,920
Exactly.

1058
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:22,840
I have spaces in here, right?

1059
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:26,040
So I need to remove these spaces

1060
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:32,480
because I'm not looking for a text, guys.

1061
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,240
I'm looking for a link text.

1062
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:37,480
Okay, So if you're using

1063
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:39,360
if you're using a next pack guys,

1064
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:43,880
you see there are some spaces before
and after this text.

1065
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:47,480
If you're using a next path
and you're using a text,

1066
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,760
you have to include the spaces. Okay.

1067
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:55,520
But if you're using a link text guys,
you don't have to include any spaces

1068
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:58,560
which are before and after that text.

1069
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:00,080
Okay.

1070
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:08,840
Is that clear?

1071
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:15,000
Is it possible to force the links

1072
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,800
to open in a new tap or the new window?

1073
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,520
You can't do that.

1074
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:22,320
You cannot do that. Why?

1075
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:24,480
Because it is.

1076
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,280
It is built by developers.

1077
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:29,480
So if they want if they want it to

1078
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:32,800
what's called, if they want it to open up

1079
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,600
in a new page, in a new window,
they would do it.

1080
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:38,480
They would configure it themselves.

1081
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:43,320
Or if they wanted to open it in a new tab,
then they would configure it that way.

1082
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:45,960
Okay.

1083
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:47,640
All right.

1084
01:02:47,640 --> 01:03:01,520
So let's run
this and see if this is going to work.

1085
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:02,840
Okay. Running here.

1086
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:03,680
All right.

1087
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:06,600
So we clicked on everything.

1088
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:09,960
And here we have three more windows, guys.

1089
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:14,000
Or it can be the tabs as well.

1090
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:17,960
So I think whenever you have it maximize
and you do it manually,

1091
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:21,240
it it it's opening a new tab.

1092
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:24,280
But whenever you have a selenium running,

1093
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:27,280
it's opening a new window in here.

1094
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:28,680
So that's not a big deal.

1095
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:29,520
Okay, guys.

1096
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:32,400
So the tab and the window are the same.

1097
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,520
So you can
we can use the same methods as we've done

1098
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:39,280
in the previous example
to switch to the main page window handle.

1099
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:40,080
Okay.

1100
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:45,960
So, so this windows opens

1101
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,920
on the same session
so we don't have to worry about it.

1102
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:57,200
Okay.

1103
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:00,240
Okay, then.

1104
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:01,680
Then it's fine, guys.

1105
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:05,320
If it if it if it's not about
the maximize, then it's fine.

1106
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:06,400
That's okay.

1107
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,880
So now I have a question to you guys.

1108
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:13,320
So I clicked on three different

1109
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:16,760
buttons in here right away.

1110
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:20,640
I didn't even switch to that
to the other windows.

1111
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:23,480
So when I click on first one,

1112
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:28,320
it opens up a new window.

1113
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:30,440
How can I click on the second one? Does

1114
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:37,440
three times.

1115
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,160
That's the.

1116
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:40,560
Oh, I didn't said okay.

1117
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:41,840
Okay. That's a good question.

1118
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:46,320
So guess, guys,

1119
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:49,680
guess what could be the

1120
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:53,040
the issue in here

1121
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:57,760
that we can click
three times on the same window but it each

1122
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:00,800
each button opens up a new window.

1123
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:09,120
Guys Any any thoughts on this?

1124
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:11,000
Because we're still in men swimming

1125
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:15,000
or tap

1126
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:19,120
classes and

1127
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,160
tap is

1128
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:27,600
not really

1129
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:30,800
no good.

1130
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:33,680
So here's the thing.

1131
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:34,880
Okay, guys.

1132
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:37,480
So whenever you try to open

1133
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:40,800
and tap or a new window,

1134
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:44,400
you click on something,
it opens a new tab or a new window.

1135
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:50,000
You don't lose focus, guys,
even though see the new page guys,

1136
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:53,200
your focus is still on the previous page.

1137
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:56,960
Okay, so selenium, how it works

1138
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:59,560
is what we click on something.

1139
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:03,120
Okay,
so we clicked on this follow on Instagram.

1140
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:05,240
We clicked on like us on Facebook.

1141
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:06,840
Why it happened?

1142
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:11,640
Because we are still on the same
main page.

1143
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:14,520
We don't see it, but our focus is there.

1144
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:18,280
We didn't switch anything yet.

1145
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:20,000
Okay guys.

1146
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:25,920
So whenever you have this kind of issue,
don't worry.

1147
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:30,760
Just think that guys,
whenever you perform actions on one page

1148
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:34,600
and it opens up a new tab,
even though you see

1149
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:38,760
visually you had selenium
didn't switch that focus yet.

1150
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:39,880
Okay.

1151
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:42,720
Is that clear?

1152
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:46,400
So that's why we

1153
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:50,160
clicked on three different buttons in here
and it worked.

1154
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:54,480
And we still have three different,
three different windows opening up.

1155
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:58,360
But the thing in here
that behind the scenes

1156
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:02,920
we then switch selenium focus
to different pages.

1157
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:09,960
Okay, yes, you can print it.

1158
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:12,040
You can print out the main page handle.
Yeah.

1159
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:15,960
After you click after after you click.

1160
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:19,240
And here you can do that.

1161
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:24,840
But as long as you don't have to print
the main, main page

1162
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:28,920
handle in here because you're already
clicking on the second and third button.

1163
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:33,600
So that's the proof
that you are still on that main page

1164
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:35,760
that you just navigate

1165
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:41,080
on the which page.

1166
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:43,440
Oh, could they may the window

1167
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:45,760
handles be a verify point?

1168
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:47,880
No, not really guys.

1169
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:53,880
I haven't seen any way anyone
verifying the window handles.

1170
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:59,640
You can verify the title and see if you're
on the same page, but you won't be.

1171
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:02,480
I mean, I haven't
seen anyone verifying the

1172
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:07,080
the window handles

1173
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:09,680
because you don't have anything expected.

1174
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:12,920
You don't have any expected value
because whenever

1175
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:16,280
you open up a new session, guys,
it will it will change.

1176
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:16,800
Right?

1177
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,480
So you get the window handle.

1178
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:20,880
What are you going to compare it with?

1179
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:22,480
You don't know, Right?

1180
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:39,120
So it's it's not a good thing to do.

1181
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:40,080
Yeah, it's fine.

1182
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:45,040
It's fine if they don't if
if one window is on top of the other one.

1183
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:52,000
It's okay guys.

1184
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,920
We are just getting the first one
to captured the first window handle,

1185
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:58,360
and I'll show you in the.

1186
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:00,200
Well, we continue this example.

1187
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:01,640
You'll see the difference, guys.

1188
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:03,480
Okay.

1189
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:05,600
Nothing happens for right now. If.

1190
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:08,560
If we don't get this window
handle in here,

1191
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:12,000
we're just going to have to get it later.

1192
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:19,080
Okay, guys guys,

1193
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:23,040
any other questions?

1194
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:25,560
Yeah,
if you comment this out, it still works.

1195
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:27,880
Guys,
I didn't do anything with this. Right?

1196
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,880
So. And you can see that

1197
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:34,400
main page handle a little bit
disabled in here and it's gray.

1198
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:42,480
So that means
we need to use this throughout our code.

1199
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:49,760
So now get we get window
handles will give us all the for exactly.

1200
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:51,120
Okay guys.

1201
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:53,360
So it's 815.

1202
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:56,920
Okay So let's take a break guys,

1203
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:59,360
and then we'll start going over

1204
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:03,120
the advanced part.

1205
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:07,360
All right.

1206
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:08,040
There you go.

1207
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:11,160
All this and the code and

1208
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:26,120
time slides on selenium.

1209
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:26,960
Okay? Yeah.

1210
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:30,040
I mean, selenium is more interactive
than Java, guys.

1211
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:31,840
That's probably

1212
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:35,840
or it's me.

1213
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:40,240
So you choose guys,

1214
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:43,640
whichever it is.

1215
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:45,680
The aim is like watching the gladiator.

1216
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:50,200
You okay?

1217
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:53,400
All right, guys,
let's have a break for 16 minutes.

1218
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:57,840
So let's come back at 830, okay?

1219
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:59,880
Or if anyone wants to

1220
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:06,920
type ten, bless me.

1221
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:07,920
Okay. Thank you.

1222
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:22,320
Thank you guys.

1223
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:23,920
All right, guys.

1224
01:11:23,920 --> 01:26:27,600
I'll see you guys in 15.

1225
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:39,680
All right, guys, let's get back.

1226
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:43,880
Let's get back and continue
with these handles.

1227
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:44,640
Right.

1228
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:50,520
Let's handle some of them.

1229
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:53,880
I hope everyone is back, guys,
so that we can continue in here.

1230
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:58,760
Okay, So we clicked on all the

1231
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:03,760
all on all the buttons,
which we have on our main page, Right.

1232
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:09,480
And as we said,
we were able to click on all of them

1233
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:13,680
because our focus never changed, right?

1234
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:15,600
We didn't switch to anywhere.

1235
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:19,160
We still on that same page and that's why

1236
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:23,640
we're able to click on all the buttons
that we identified, Right?

1237
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:26,400
Okay. All right.

1238
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:27,720
So now, guys,

1239
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:32,080
now, since I have how many windows
I have right now, how many times do I have

1240
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:34,280
after I click

1241
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:39,160
three buttons.

1242
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:40,600
Four. Right.

1243
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:44,640
Okay, So let's
get them stored inside the container.

1244
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:45,400
All right.

1245
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:48,200
So what I'm going to do is create a set,

1246
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:52,000
create a set of strings in here.

1247
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:55,440
And again, all window

1248
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:58,280
handles, right, is equal to

1249
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:00,960
driver.

1250
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:05,520
The get window handles right
and then import

1251
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:10,080
set in here.

1252
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:14,680
So now let's print out how many

1253
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:19,240
how many windows we have in here.

1254
01:28:19,240 --> 01:28:22,160
Going to be all window handles, dot size.

1255
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:25,560
All right. Okay.

1256
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:28,920
So now what we want to do,

1257
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:31,880
what I want to do, guys, I want to iterate

1258
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:35,520
through through all the handles.

1259
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:40,440
Okay, Set

1260
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:46,720
how many windows we opened.

1261
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:51,840
Now we're open for windows.

1262
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:55,760
All right, So now what
I want to do, I want to go over

1263
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:58,480
each window.

1264
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:01,240
Okay?

1265
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:03,520
Oh, by clicking. Okay,

1266
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:06,080
So I want to go through each window,

1267
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:10,360
get the title and, print it out.

1268
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:14,840
Okay, guys, is that clear?

1269
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:19,320
Okay, good.

1270
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:25,760
So now what I want to do,
I want to start iterating right that case.

1271
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:28,800
What we want to do,
we want to create a Knights of Raider

1272
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:32,400
iterator of strings.

1273
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:36,840
And here is equal to all window handles

1274
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:39,360
that are doing right.

1275
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:41,200
So we have this.

1276
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:43,080
So now what I want to do,

1277
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:47,880
since I have more windows than we had
in the previous example, right?

1278
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:50,400
So before we had to, now we have for.

1279
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:54,120
So instead of doing everything manually,
what I want to do,

1280
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:57,040
I want to do it through the help of loop.

1281
01:29:57,480 --> 01:30:00,560
Okay, so here what I will do

1282
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:03,760
exactly I will do y loop.

1283
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:04,800
Okay.

1284
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:07,680
And I'll say the wild loop. If

1285
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:11,760
I have something, my, my next step.

1286
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:12,840
Right.

1287
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:17,280
What is going to happen is I need to

1288
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:22,080
I need to get the title
and I need to print it out.

1289
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:24,280
Okay.

1290
01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:26,720
So what is my next step in here, guys?

1291
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:28,640
So I have my iterator.

1292
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:31,960
I have everything inside
my set container, right?

1293
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:35,880
And I'm to go through each

1294
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:40,040
and every window handle
by using this violence.

1295
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:42,240
So what is my next step in here?

1296
01:30:42,240 --> 01:30:53,240
This.

1297
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:54,000
Okay,

1298
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
so I to write that next.

1299
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:57,480
Right?

1300
01:30:57,480 --> 01:30:59,640
What if I do isolated next?

1301
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:09,680
What am I getting in return?

1302
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:10,040
Okay.

1303
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:11,280
Is it the main page?

1304
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:13,360
Guys, I'm inside my loop.

1305
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:17,200
Okay, so in the first iteration, yes, I'm

1306
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:21,120
going to get my main page right,

1307
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:23,560
but on the second iteration,

1308
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:28,240
I'm getting a different one.

1309
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:31,160
Right? So what we can do in here, since

1310
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:33,640
we're iterating

1311
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:36,880
multiple times and we don't know

1312
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:41,400
either it's main page or either
child's page, right?

1313
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:45,200
So what we can do, we can simply store

1314
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:49,360
it inside the string,
which is just the handle.

1315
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:49,920
Okay?

1316
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:51,960
We don't have to we don't have to

1317
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:55,320
say that it's main

1318
01:31:55,320 --> 01:31:57,920
page or child page or whatever page it is,

1319
01:31:58,640 --> 01:32:02,760
because whenever we iterating,
we go through all of them, right?

1320
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:06,840
So every step I'm getting a handle, right?

1321
01:32:07,160 --> 01:32:10,800
So if there is something I step over,
I get another handle.

1322
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:11,880
Okay?

1323
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:15,600
Next iteration, I step over,
I get another handle right.

1324
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:17,840
Okay, so we have the handle.

1325
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:24,240
So what do I have to do right now
in order to print out the titles

1326
01:32:24,240 --> 01:32:31,240
of all those four pages?

1327
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:33,280
Is it handle that get title? Does

1328
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:37,680
handle is a string, guys.

1329
01:32:37,680 --> 01:32:40,640
Right. Handle is a string.

1330
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:43,400
So what I need to do,

1331
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:47,040
I need to do.

1332
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:47,360
Okay.

1333
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:51,440
So do I have to switch first
or I have to get the title search?

1334
01:32:51,480 --> 01:32:53,560
Guess which one

1335
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:05,040
switch or title.

1336
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:06,640
Okay, so I see title.

1337
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:08,520
I see switch first.

1338
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:11,600
Okay,
so we need to get the title first, right?

1339
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:13,680
Because we get the handle.

1340
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:16,440
We already have the focus, right?

1341
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:22,920
So on the main page we get the main page
title and then switch to the next one.

1342
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:25,400
Right? Okay, so let's try this.

1343
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:29,760
So driver that

1344
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:38,360
title in here,

1345
01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:41,720
let's do string

1346
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:43,800
title.

1347
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:44,800
Okay?

1348
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:47,240
And then what we need to do,

1349
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:52,880
we need to switch to the next window

1350
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,480
with this handle.

1351
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:56,920
Right.

1352
01:33:56,920 --> 01:33:58,040
Is this clear, Guys?

1353
01:33:58,040 --> 01:34:06,560
Any questions before I run this?

1354
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:10,080
Okay, so let's run
this and see what we're going

1355
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:22,600
to have.

1356
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:24,880
Okay. Getting for

1357
01:34:27,240 --> 01:34:28,040
four different

1358
01:34:28,040 --> 01:34:38,280
windows in here.

1359
01:34:38,280 --> 01:34:40,560
Okay. What happened, guys?
What did we miss in here?

1360
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:53,480
Guys, What did we missing here?

1361
01:34:53,480 --> 01:34:56,600
Where do I see my title exactly?

1362
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:59,200
We didn't print right? So

1363
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:02,920
what I need to do,

1364
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:05,040
I need to print it.

1365
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:07,360
Okay, so I got the title, guys.

1366
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:09,720
I. What do I need to do then?

1367
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:13,160
Do I need to switch
and then print or I have to print it

1368
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:14,840
and then switch

1369
01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:19,800
print first.

1370
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:20,360
Right.

1371
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:24,760
Okay, so it's printed first
and then switch

1372
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:27,520
the windows.

1373
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:43,200
Okay, so let's run this again.

1374
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:45,920
If morning.

1375
01:35:46,360 --> 01:35:51,920
Here we go.

1376
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:56,160
Everything in here.

1377
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:57,360
There we go.

1378
01:35:57,400 --> 01:35:59,640
But now what we have in here,

1379
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:03,960
where for which is we printed on line 29,

1380
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:07,720
which we have for different
windows and then for

1381
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:12,560
titles that we have on our pages.

1382
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:13,480
Okay.

1383
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:23,200
Is that clear, guys,
Any questions in here?

1384
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:24,040
Okay,

1385
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:29,200
so now what I want to do, guys, I want to

1386
01:36:29,640 --> 01:36:33,800
since I opened up three more windows,
now I have four in total, right?

1387
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:37,640
We got
the title was switched to those windows.

1388
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:37,960
Right.

1389
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:44,160
So now what I want to do,
I want to close all the other

1390
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:48,760
all the windows that I just opened
and I have two

1391
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:53,680
and I want to keep the main page
that I navigated first open.

1392
01:36:54,360 --> 01:36:56,280
Okay, Is that clear, guys?

1393
01:36:56,280 --> 01:36:58,640
So Let's go ahead and open this.

1394
01:36:58,920 --> 01:37:00,840
So I open these child windows.

1395
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:03,760
What I want to do,
I want to close all of these, okay?

1396
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:07,440
I want this to be open. Okay.

1397
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:10,120
All right.

1398
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:13,200
So how are we going to do this in here?

1399
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:17,320
So we going through the next one,
we're getting title

1400
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:20,240
and we're switching to the handle.

1401
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:24,160
So how can we have that?

1402
01:37:24,160 --> 01:37:27,640
I, I keep the main page

1403
01:37:27,640 --> 01:37:30,040
open and close the other ones,

1404
01:37:30,640 --> 01:37:35,080
the other child windows.

1405
01:37:35,080 --> 01:37:36,720
Okay. If condition.

1406
01:37:36,720 --> 01:37:38,840
Okay, That's very good.

1407
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:39,160
Okay.

1408
01:37:39,160 --> 01:37:41,320
What am I having in my condition guys,

1409
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:45,160
if it's not main.

1410
01:37:45,160 --> 01:37:46,480
Okay, that's very good.

1411
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:48,720
So what am I comparing it with?

1412
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:53,120
What am I comparing inside the
if condition

1413
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:58,760
guys, Is it the title?

1414
01:37:58,760 --> 01:38:04,480
Because I see two same titles in here
guys.

1415
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:12,520
The titles are the same.

1416
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:13,480
Exactly.

1417
01:38:13,480 --> 01:38:19,680
We need to compare the main page
handle with a handle that is coming.

1418
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:24,840
Okay, so the main page handle,
we got it in here.

1419
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:28,400
Okay, so right now

1420
01:38:28,440 --> 01:38:31,200
I have this stored already, right?

1421
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:34,280
So what I am going to do,

1422
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:38,040
I need to compare this page handle

1423
01:38:40,840 --> 01:38:42,240
equals

1424
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:45,720
to the handle I get right.

1425
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:52,880
And then what I need to do, let's say,
okay, let's get the title,

1426
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:59,000
let's print it out and let's switch right.

1427
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:18,400
And what do I want to do
at the very end, guys?

1428
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:19,880
What am I doing in here?

1429
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:21,080
I need to close it. Right.

1430
01:39:21,080 --> 01:39:21,880
Simple.

1431
01:39:21,880 --> 01:39:25,040
The driver dot close.

1432
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:27,120
Okay, But here, guys,

1433
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:33,400
my condition has to be the reverse, right?

1434
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:36,400
Because I'm. I am inside my wild.

1435
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:39,120
Look what I do. I get the handle.

1436
01:39:39,400 --> 01:39:44,520
So if I want to keep the main page open,

1437
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:49,080
I need to skip
whenever they're both equal.

1438
01:39:49,680 --> 01:39:50,080
Right.

1439
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:53,280
So here what I am going to do, I'm

1440
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:58,280
saying that only
if my main page is not equal to the handle

1441
01:39:58,280 --> 01:40:02,840
that I just landed,
then perform these actions.

1442
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:05,600
Okay, so let's run this and see

1443
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:20,760
if this is going to work.

1444
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:23,360
Okay. Opening these three

1445
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:30,120
things it sale.

1446
01:40:30,120 --> 01:40:30,800
Right.

1447
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:38,960
Okay, so let's see what happened.

1448
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:41,200
No such window exception.

1449
01:40:41,200 --> 01:40:41,600
Okay.

1450
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:51,440
What does it mean, guys?

1451
01:40:51,440 --> 01:40:56,160
So here, guys,

1452
01:40:56,160 --> 01:40:59,600
whenever we're switched, right,

1453
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:04,800
whenever we switched, we closed it right.

1454
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:07,440
So where is my focus right now?

1455
01:41:07,720 --> 01:41:10,800
If I am inside this,

1456
01:41:12,120 --> 01:41:15,000
If I am inside that,
if statement right now.

1457
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:18,080
So the first one, it's okay.

1458
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:19,720
So it's open.

1459
01:41:19,720 --> 01:41:24,560
I am taking I'm getting the title,
I'm switching, I'm closing.

1460
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:25,280
Right.

1461
01:41:25,320 --> 01:41:28,160
But then my next iteration,

1462
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:32,000
what happens is

1463
01:41:32,240 --> 01:41:37,200
what if I don't have that right?

1464
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:40,240
So we need to get the title when guys

1465
01:41:46,760 --> 01:41:48,440
after switching,

1466
01:41:48,440 --> 01:41:52,080
we need to make sure we switched our focus

1467
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:56,280
and only then we get the title right.

1468
01:41:57,080 --> 01:41:59,760
So let's run this

1469
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:00,040
thing.

1470
01:42:00,040 --> 01:42:02,880
So this way and

1471
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:04,360
let me

1472
01:42:04,360 --> 01:42:10,680
run this.

1473
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:13,360
Let's see if this is going to work

1474
01:42:29,160 --> 01:42:29,640
open.

1475
01:42:29,640 --> 01:42:31,920
S There we go.

1476
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:33,960
What happened, guys?

1477
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:35,960
So it's closed.

1478
01:42:35,960 --> 01:42:40,560
That's three of the child windows
and we still have

1479
01:42:40,920 --> 01:42:43,800
our main page open, right?

1480
01:42:45,120 --> 01:42:46,680
So pretty simple.

1481
01:42:46,680 --> 01:43:07,800
Any questions on this, guys?

1482
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:08,680
A little bit tricky.

1483
01:43:08,680 --> 01:43:15,600
Yes, it's a little bit tricky, but
with with practice, it's it's all good.

1484
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:18,120
I mean, it's not that complicated.

1485
01:43:18,120 --> 01:43:22,080
And as I said, guys, in a real project,
in a real application,

1486
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:26,200
you won't be handling like three, four
or five different tabs

1487
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:29,800
or windows. Okay.

1488
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:35,000
So the most the most you will be handling
two different tabs.

1489
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:35,720
Okay.

1490
01:43:35,880 --> 01:43:36,960
All right, guys.

1491
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:47,360
So. Oh,

1492
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:50,840
here the title.

1493
01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:52,000
Okay, Why? Why?

1494
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:53,520
We're missing that.

1495
01:43:53,520 --> 01:44:03,400
The main page title in here.

1496
01:44:03,400 --> 01:44:06,720
Because we're excluding the main page
from the loop.

1497
01:44:06,720 --> 01:44:07,240
Exactly.

1498
01:44:07,240 --> 01:44:12,080
So in the if condition, if our main page
handle equals this handle,

1499
01:44:12,240 --> 01:44:15,480
we're not inside this and we're

1500
01:44:15,480 --> 01:44:19,040
not getting any titles. Okay.

1501
01:44:20,280 --> 01:44:20,840
Exactly.

1502
01:44:20,840 --> 01:44:21,560
Okay.

1503
01:44:21,560 --> 01:44:24,160
So one more time the wild loop, right?

1504
01:44:24,680 --> 01:44:27,120
So we're going inside the wild loop.

1505
01:44:27,120 --> 01:44:33,320
We have a set of window handles,
which is for different tabs or windows.

1506
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:34,120
Right?

1507
01:44:34,120 --> 01:44:39,360
So the first time I go in there,
my next step is just the handle.

1508
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:42,720
It doesn't really matter
which handle I am getting right?

1509
01:44:42,720 --> 01:44:46,880
And then in here I have a check, right?

1510
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:48,160
I have a f condition.

1511
01:44:48,160 --> 01:44:51,160
And here if the main page handle that

1512
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:54,360
I got on line 90

1513
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:57,800
equals that the handle I am on right now,

1514
01:44:59,240 --> 01:45:02,040
then I'm not going to be performing
anything.

1515
01:45:02,440 --> 01:45:06,360
Okay I will be switching to that window

1516
01:45:06,360 --> 01:45:10,080
handle right to the handle
that I just stepped in.

1517
01:45:10,440 --> 01:45:13,160
Only when my main page handle

1518
01:45:13,160 --> 01:45:17,080
is not equal to this handle
that I just Septem.

1519
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:24,040
Okay.

1520
01:45:24,040 --> 01:45:24,720
Yeah, that's fine.

1521
01:45:24,720 --> 01:45:29,280
I mean, you can you can exclude this
get titles outside of the F condition,

1522
01:45:29,480 --> 01:45:34,000
but the main point is to manipulate
with the with the windows themselves.

1523
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:35,600
Right to switching.

1524
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:37,800
Okay.
You can exclude this. That's fine. This

1525
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:45,000
f any questions.

1526
01:45:46,040 --> 01:45:58,280
See? Okay.

1527
01:45:58,440 --> 01:46:02,120
There's a matter of no such window
exception.

1528
01:46:02,120 --> 01:46:03,760
So please send us the code.

1529
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:06,120
Okay, so I want to see the code
that you type in.

1530
01:46:06,120 --> 01:46:06,960
I think

1531
01:46:08,280 --> 01:46:11,240
you need to change something in there.

1532
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:13,120
All right, guys, if there is no questions.

1533
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:17,160
So what I want to do now,
since I closed all the

1534
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:20,160
all the other child

1535
01:46:20,760 --> 01:46:22,560
tabs, what I want to do,

1536
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:25,640
I want to click on this button again

1537
01:46:26,720 --> 01:46:30,600
and open up a new tab or window.

1538
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:31,400
Okay.

1539
01:46:33,320 --> 01:46:37,000
So it's going to put it in here.

1540
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:37,320
Okay.

1541
01:46:37,320 --> 01:46:53,080
If I run this right now,
is this going to work or no?

1542
01:46:53,080 --> 01:46:54,000
Okay, cool.

1543
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:58,240
Let's run
this and see if this is going to work.

1544
01:46:58,240 --> 01:46:58,680
Okay.

1545
01:46:58,680 --> 01:47:01,200
So I see there's a lot of yes's.
Okay, cool.

1546
01:47:01,720 --> 01:47:12,080
So let me run this.

1547
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:13,800
A opening.

1548
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:20,640
Three different windows.

1549
01:47:20,640 --> 01:47:22,960
Okay, Closing this.

1550
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:27,840
So now let's
go ahead and take a look in here.

1551
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:28,840
What happened, guys?

1552
01:47:30,240 --> 01:47:33,120
No such window exception.

1553
01:47:33,120 --> 01:47:35,840
Target window or be closed.

1554
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:42,720
What happened in here, guys?

1555
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:55,200
Why you didn't click on this button?

1556
01:47:55,200 --> 01:47:56,440
Yeah, it's not closed. Right?

1557
01:47:56,440 --> 01:48:00,360
So I kept my main page open
and what I need it to do,

1558
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:04,600
I want it to click on Instagram button.

1559
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:06,160
We handle it.

1560
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:08,440
Sure, if that's a good question.

1561
01:48:08,440 --> 01:48:12,920
So why do we need to switch first,

1562
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:27,840
then click?

1563
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:31,440
Because the focus is not on our main page.

1564
01:48:31,800 --> 01:48:34,680
Absolutely right, guys.

1565
01:48:34,680 --> 01:48:37,440
So if you go in here so,

1566
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:40,160
I closed three different windows, right?

1567
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:44,040
So when I closed the last one where it was

1568
01:48:44,040 --> 01:48:52,800
my focus guys before,

1569
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:57,960
when I closed my last tab,
my focus was on the last window.

1570
01:48:58,280 --> 01:49:00,480
So I closed it right?

1571
01:49:00,680 --> 01:49:01,560
I closed it.

1572
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:05,160
So now my selenium
is looking for where to go, right?

1573
01:49:05,440 --> 01:49:08,320
So I need to tell the selenium.

1574
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:10,280
Okay, so with closed doors.

1575
01:49:10,280 --> 01:49:11,640
Good. That's very good.

1576
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:15,440
So now what you need to do,
you need to switch back

1577
01:49:15,440 --> 01:49:19,600
your focus to the
main page that is still open.

1578
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:21,360
Okay.

1579
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:26,400
Is that clear, guys, As we said before,
guys, how we opened these three

1580
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:29,480
without switching
Because even though we see

1581
01:49:29,480 --> 01:49:31,680
those three trial

1582
01:49:33,080 --> 01:49:34,840
tabs on Windows,

1583
01:49:34,840 --> 01:49:38,560
we are still able to click on this
because our focus

1584
01:49:38,760 --> 01:49:42,120
is still on the main page. Okay

1585
01:49:45,200 --> 01:49:47,640
You know, there's no to make a default,

1586
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:51,960
but you have to switch back to the main
right.

1587
01:49:51,960 --> 01:49:55,560
So switch to the window.

1588
01:49:55,800 --> 01:49:58,600
Where do we have our main page
window, guys?

1589
01:49:59,480 --> 01:50:02,800
We have our main page window right on line

1590
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:05,720
19, so grab that

1591
01:50:07,080 --> 01:50:08,160
pasted in here.

1592
01:50:08,160 --> 01:50:11,120
So we switch back to the main page
and only

1593
01:50:11,120 --> 01:50:14,200
then we click on Instagram button again.

1594
01:50:14,880 --> 01:50:19,800
Okay, Is that clear, guys?

1595
01:50:19,800 --> 01:50:23,160
Any questions?

1596
01:50:23,160 --> 01:50:26,400
So let's run
this and see visually what is going on.

1597
01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:32,280
The opening three, right?

1598
01:50:32,280 --> 01:50:36,600
So we need to close all of them now.

1599
01:50:36,600 --> 01:50:37,680
Okay, closed.

1600
01:50:37,680 --> 01:50:42,960
And now switch back to the main
and clicked on Instagram

1601
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:47,920
button.

1602
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:49,560
Click all three buttons.

1603
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:51,800
Yes. So okay guys.

1604
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:54,840
So the focus stays on the main page

1605
01:50:54,840 --> 01:50:58,200
when, when I just opened it, right,

1606
01:50:58,320 --> 01:51:02,240
I open my main page,
I click on three different buttons.

1607
01:51:02,480 --> 01:51:06,600
So while I'm clicking on these
three buttons, am I switching anywhere?

1608
01:51:07,480 --> 01:51:08,400
No. Right.

1609
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:11,760
So that's why
my focus stays on the main page.

1610
01:51:12,280 --> 01:51:15,040
But whenever I am inside the

1611
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:17,880
why loop, right I am.

1612
01:51:18,200 --> 01:51:21,440
I keep switching the windows
and closing them.

1613
01:51:21,720 --> 01:51:25,280
So the last window when I closed

1614
01:51:25,320 --> 01:51:28,200
before I closed, I change my

1615
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:32,760
I changed my focus to the last window.

1616
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:35,280
Right. And then close it.

1617
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:40,000
So when I close that window
now we don't have anything to focus on.

1618
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:42,280
And then

1619
01:51:42,280 --> 01:51:47,600
we need to switch to the main manually
and to click that button again.

1620
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:53,680
Okay, I hope this is clear, guys.

1621
01:51:53,680 --> 01:51:56,480
Let me actually

1622
01:51:56,480 --> 01:51:58,120
put you some notes in here.

1623
01:51:58,120 --> 01:52:00,040
So that's going to be

1624
01:52:00,720 --> 01:52:03,640
easier to start

1625
01:52:05,480 --> 01:52:07,320
iterating

1626
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:12,120
through handles.

1627
01:52:12,120 --> 01:52:15,680
They get the next

1628
01:52:15,960 --> 01:52:17,320
handle

1629
01:52:18,080 --> 01:52:20,040
on there and we need to set

1630
01:52:20,040 --> 01:52:26,800
a condition, set

1631
01:52:27,480 --> 01:52:30,080
condition in here.

1632
01:52:30,280 --> 01:52:33,840
Then the next one,

1633
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:40,440
switch,

1634
01:52:40,440 --> 01:52:43,440
switch to a window

1635
01:52:47,720 --> 01:52:48,480
that's

1636
01:52:49,600 --> 01:52:53,040
equal to

1637
01:52:53,280 --> 01:52:54,000
main page.

1638
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:58,560
Then, Okay.

1639
01:52:58,840 --> 01:53:00,400
And then

1640
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:10,160
two and

1641
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:12,360
then.

1642
01:53:12,360 --> 01:53:13,520
All right.

1643
01:53:14,160 --> 01:53:21,400
Any questions, guys?

1644
01:53:21,400 --> 01:53:22,800
Oh, clear.

1645
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:25,200
A little bit confusing at first, guys,

1646
01:53:25,200 --> 01:53:29,040
but by the time and practice,
we should be able to

1647
01:53:30,320 --> 01:53:31,480
get comfortable in that.

1648
01:53:31,480 --> 01:53:36,200
Okay.

1649
01:53:36,200 --> 01:53:39,960
And I'll give you a homework, guys,
so that you guys can play around with

1650
01:53:40,160 --> 01:53:49,200
with different windows.

1651
01:53:49,200 --> 01:53:52,080
All right.

1652
01:53:52,080 --> 01:53:53,440
The windows are closed

1653
01:53:56,160 --> 01:53:57,120
nowhere.

1654
01:53:57,120 --> 01:54:00,280
There's no there's no focus at that time.

1655
01:54:00,920 --> 01:54:05,400
If all the windows are if the windows
are closed and there's one remaining.

1656
01:54:05,400 --> 01:54:11,040
So when you had your focus on the last one
and you close that window

1657
01:54:11,240 --> 01:54:15,280
so you don't have a focus at all, okay.

1658
01:54:15,800 --> 01:54:19,360
So you have to switch to the

1659
01:54:19,360 --> 01:54:21,080
to the main page or to the page

1660
01:54:21,080 --> 01:54:27,960
that is open right now.

1661
01:54:27,960 --> 01:54:29,960
Can I give you some more homework?

1662
01:54:29,960 --> 01:54:33,520
I'll see you guys. Okay.

1663
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:37,800
I have two tasks for you for the homework,
but I'll see if I can come up

1664
01:54:37,800 --> 01:54:46,200
with anything else.

1665
01:54:46,200 --> 01:54:47,520
All right?

1666
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:48,360
Okay, guys.

1667
01:54:48,360 --> 01:54:52,320
So clear with the

1668
01:54:54,160 --> 01:54:55,960
what's called clear with a window.

1669
01:54:55,960 --> 01:55:01,200
So now what's going to happen is
we will be going over the weights.

1670
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:04,200
Okay,
So we'll start going over the weights

1671
01:55:04,200 --> 01:55:07,080
in selenium right now,
and then we'll continue tomorrow.

1672
01:55:07,360 --> 01:55:11,760
Okay.

1673
01:55:11,760 --> 01:55:15,400
Now, with closing the last window,

1674
01:55:15,680 --> 01:55:18,520
the focus will not be anywhere.

1675
01:55:18,520 --> 01:55:19,360
Okay.

1676
01:55:19,800 --> 01:55:23,400
So you don't have focus on any page
because your page is closed

1677
01:55:24,600 --> 01:55:25,560
and you need

1678
01:55:25,560 --> 01:55:28,680
to get back to the page
that is open right now.

1679
01:55:29,560 --> 01:55:34,760
Okay.

1680
01:55:34,760 --> 01:55:36,080
All right.

1681
01:55:36,400 --> 01:55:39,760
So let me

1682
01:55:46,120 --> 01:55:47,320
get back to the notes.

1683
01:55:47,320 --> 01:55:49,440
Okay, guys. So now

1684
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:52,880
so before guys,

1685
01:55:52,920 --> 01:55:55,520
before, if we had to pause something,

1686
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:57,520
if we had to add some time to

1687
01:56:01,080 --> 01:56:02,640
to wait for a little bit.

1688
01:56:02,640 --> 01:56:06,560
Guys, what did we have to use you guys

1689
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:10,080
that.

1690
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:12,840
That's right. Okay.

1691
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:16,920
So in Selenium, we have different
different kinds weights in here.

1692
01:56:16,920 --> 01:56:17,720
Okay?

1693
01:56:17,800 --> 01:56:21,080
So thread that sleep is going to do
what is going to pause

1694
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:24,360
your execution for a couple of seconds.

1695
01:56:24,360 --> 01:56:26,400
However, you mentioned the seconds, right?

1696
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:29,160
So 2 seconds, five, ten,
whatever you want to do.

1697
01:56:29,560 --> 01:56:32,400
Okay. Now

1698
01:56:32,400 --> 01:56:36,040
what are we actually guys
stopping in here?

1699
01:56:36,040 --> 01:56:38,320
So what are we trying to do?

1700
01:56:38,320 --> 01:56:40,080
So we tried to exit.

1701
01:56:40,080 --> 01:56:43,600
I mean, we're trying
to pause our execution, but for what?

1702
01:56:43,680 --> 01:56:48,400
What are we trying to do in here, guys?

1703
01:56:48,400 --> 01:56:50,520
So if we don't do it,
what's going to happen?

1704
01:56:50,520 --> 01:56:52,480
So our code is going to fail.

1705
01:56:52,480 --> 01:57:00,560
So what is actually happening in here,
guys?

1706
01:57:00,560 --> 01:57:02,760
So windows take some time to load.

1707
01:57:02,760 --> 01:57:06,720
Okay, So our is really fast

1708
01:57:07,080 --> 01:57:10,920
and the page might not
be loading too fast.

1709
01:57:11,280 --> 01:57:11,640
Right?

1710
01:57:12,680 --> 01:57:15,760
So what are we trying to do in here, guys?

1711
01:57:16,040 --> 01:57:18,320
We're trying to bring

1712
01:57:19,400 --> 01:57:21,640
the our page or the code

1713
01:57:22,080 --> 01:57:25,320
to the same level of speed.

1714
01:57:25,320 --> 01:57:26,120
Right.

1715
01:57:26,320 --> 01:57:29,040
So basically what we're doing in here,

1716
01:57:29,160 --> 01:57:33,280
we're
synchronizing our code, our execution

1717
01:57:33,640 --> 01:57:37,880
and whatever we have on the Web page,
okay?

1718
01:57:38,080 --> 01:57:43,200
Because usually if we run our code
without any weights, it's really fast.

1719
01:57:43,200 --> 01:57:45,240
It's not going to wait for anything.

1720
01:57:45,240 --> 01:57:46,600
It will just run.

1721
01:57:46,600 --> 01:57:47,880
And if it

1722
01:57:47,880 --> 01:57:51,080
if it doesn't find any elements,
what it's going to do, it's going to fail.

1723
01:57:51,480 --> 01:57:52,000
Right.

1724
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:57,320
So in this case, what we need to do,
we need to synchronize, right.

1725
01:57:57,480 --> 01:58:01,120
Synchronize our code, our execution

1726
01:58:01,440 --> 01:58:06,600
and the load page, page loading or element
loading, whatever it is.

1727
01:58:06,840 --> 01:58:10,040
So. All right. Any questions? Got

1728
01:58:12,640 --> 01:58:19,120
it right.

1729
01:58:19,120 --> 01:58:21,040
Synchronization right.

1730
01:58:21,040 --> 01:58:23,440
So it is

1731
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:27,960
here.

1732
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:33,160
The synchronization right is the process

1733
01:58:34,680 --> 01:58:37,800
of bringing

1734
01:58:39,400 --> 01:58:43,320
this feed of two or more

1735
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:50,160
components right to the same level.

1736
01:58:51,040 --> 01:58:52,440
Okay.

1737
01:58:52,440 --> 01:58:55,640
In this case, we're bringing

1738
01:58:55,640 --> 01:58:57,680
we'll bring in our script

1739
01:58:58,040 --> 01:59:02,520
and page load to the same speed.

1740
01:59:02,520 --> 01:59:03,200
Right.

1741
01:59:03,200 --> 01:59:08,320
So in this case,

1742
01:59:08,320 --> 01:59:09,640
we are

1743
01:59:14,840 --> 01:59:15,120
we're

1744
01:59:16,240 --> 01:59:17,680
bringing

1745
01:59:18,120 --> 01:59:21,560
scripts and

1746
01:59:21,560 --> 01:59:24,680
page load to the same

1747
01:59:24,680 --> 01:59:26,520
speed level.

1748
01:59:26,520 --> 01:59:29,040
Okay. All right.

1749
01:59:29,040 --> 01:59:32,560
So basically what we're doing,
we're synchronizing, right?

1750
01:59:32,920 --> 01:59:35,480
So thread that's sleep, right?

1751
01:59:35,480 --> 01:59:37,080
And we talked about this.

1752
01:59:37,080 --> 01:59:38,520
What is

1753
01:59:39,120 --> 01:59:41,880
what kind of weight is this, guys?

1754
01:59:41,880 --> 01:59:43,520
Anybody know?

1755
01:59:43,640 --> 01:59:46,960
Does anyone have any idea
what kind of weight is this

1756
01:59:47,800 --> 01:59:49,760
So we set manually.

1757
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:52,520
Okay.

1758
01:59:52,520 --> 01:59:54,440
Anything else, guys

1759
01:59:59,160 --> 02:00:00,240
with a computer speed?

1760
02:00:00,240 --> 02:00:01,400
No, I don't think so.

1761
02:00:01,400 --> 02:00:03,280
I mean, if it's computer speed, then

1762
02:00:04,520 --> 02:00:05,880
we when you

1763
02:00:05,880 --> 02:00:08,960
start your execution,
when you executing starts,

1764
02:00:09,120 --> 02:00:11,160
it has nothing to do with the computer
speed

1765
02:00:14,560 --> 02:00:15,440
or time.

1766
02:00:15,440 --> 02:00:17,440
Wait, time, temporary. Okay.

1767
02:00:17,840 --> 02:00:18,920
So almost.

1768
02:00:18,920 --> 02:00:21,280
It's a static weight, right?

1769
02:00:21,720 --> 02:00:24,640
So whenever you
anything, it's a static weight.

1770
02:00:24,760 --> 02:00:25,920
You don't change it.

1771
02:00:25,920 --> 02:00:29,200
It's it will wait for the amount of

1772
02:00:29,640 --> 02:00:32,800
for the amount of seconds
that you specify.

1773
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:33,280
Right.

1774
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:36,880
So it's not going to change
according to the to the web elements

1775
02:00:36,880 --> 02:00:40,240
or according to the web page load. Right.

1776
02:00:40,480 --> 02:00:43,000
So what it is, is it's a static way

1777
02:00:43,200 --> 02:00:46,680
that you give the amount
of the weight in there.

1778
02:00:46,920 --> 02:00:50,440
Okay, So static weight

1779
02:00:51,120 --> 02:00:55,800
or we also say
it is unconditional weight, right?

1780
02:00:57,520 --> 02:01:00,280
Because here we don't have any conditions.

1781
02:01:00,280 --> 02:01:03,600
You are just causing your execution
for the

1782
02:01:04,040 --> 02:01:06,160
for some amount of time and that's it.

1783
02:01:06,640 --> 02:01:06,960
Right.

1784
02:01:08,600 --> 02:01:09,720
As the easiest job.

1785
02:01:09,720 --> 02:01:10,440
Yeah.

1786
02:01:10,960 --> 02:01:12,880
Yeah. I mean, sleeps all the time.

1787
02:01:12,880 --> 02:01:14,040
There you go.

1788
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:15,240
Okay.

1789
02:01:15,240 --> 02:01:16,440
So now

1790
02:01:18,200 --> 02:01:20,760
any other types of selenium weights?

1791
02:01:20,760 --> 02:01:26,480
We know guys.

1792
02:01:26,480 --> 02:01:29,520
So there's two types of

1793
02:01:30,360 --> 02:01:35,400
so in here.

1794
02:01:35,400 --> 02:01:36,760
Explicit weight.

1795
02:01:36,760 --> 02:01:37,760
Okay, What else?

1796
02:01:37,760 --> 02:01:44,080
Implicit weight and what else, guys?

1797
02:01:44,080 --> 02:01:47,840
Implicit, explicit and slow and weights.

1798
02:01:48,120 --> 02:01:51,400
Okay, So three different types of weights.

1799
02:01:51,400 --> 02:01:53,400
We have in selenium.

1800
02:01:53,400 --> 02:01:55,280
Okay.

1801
02:01:55,280 --> 02:02:00,760
Implicit weight, explicit weight and

1802
02:02:01,800 --> 02:02:04,480
slight weight.

1803
02:02:04,480 --> 02:02:05,160
Okay.

1804
02:02:05,240 --> 02:02:08,000
So today we will only be going over

1805
02:02:08,120 --> 02:02:11,000
implicit weights and tomorrow
we'll finish it up.

1806
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:16,080
Well, explicit and slow int weights.

1807
02:02:16,600 --> 02:02:19,280
Okay.

1808
02:02:19,280 --> 02:02:20,120
All right.

1809
02:02:20,280 --> 02:02:22,360
So what is implicit weight? Does

1810
02:02:24,040 --> 02:02:38,400
anyone did research on this?

1811
02:02:38,400 --> 02:02:39,360
We don't define.

1812
02:02:39,360 --> 02:02:41,800
Okay, what else, guys?

1813
02:02:41,800 --> 02:02:44,040
Oh, we will be defining
the implicit weight.

1814
02:02:44,520 --> 02:02:47,520
We will be defining it.

1815
02:02:47,520 --> 02:02:49,080
What is the implicit weight

1816
02:02:58,480 --> 02:02:59,480
by default?

1817
02:02:59,480 --> 02:03:00,480
Okay.

1818
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:02,440
A way for a certain amount of time.

1819
02:03:02,440 --> 02:03:05,160
Okay.

1820
02:03:05,160 --> 02:03:08,360
So implicit weight, guys,

1821
02:03:08,800 --> 02:03:11,720
is a global weight insulin.

1822
02:03:12,520 --> 02:03:15,880
So what it does it tells the web driver

1823
02:03:16,200 --> 02:03:18,360
to wait for a certain amount of time

1824
02:03:19,520 --> 02:03:21,840
before throwing an exception.

1825
02:03:22,760 --> 02:03:23,480
Okay.

1826
02:03:23,480 --> 02:03:28,760
So we're going to be inviting the implicit
weight only once in our script

1827
02:03:28,920 --> 02:03:31,680
and it will be applied
for the whole session

1828
02:03:31,840 --> 02:03:34,840
of the execution.

1829
02:03:34,840 --> 02:03:36,320
Is that clear, guys?

1830
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:38,200
And I'll show you how to implement that.

1831
02:03:38,200 --> 02:03:41,040
But let's go through the theoretical part
first,

1832
02:03:41,520 --> 02:03:46,200
okay?

1833
02:03:46,200 --> 02:03:48,680
Isn't it based on the page size loading?

1834
02:03:48,680 --> 02:03:50,400
Not not this one.

1835
02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:57,240
No default for defined.

1836
02:03:58,760 --> 02:04:00,600
So it is a define.

1837
02:04:00,600 --> 02:04:05,360
So there's no
I mean there is no default weight.

1838
02:04:05,360 --> 02:04:09,320
So it's not going to there's no weight
that it's going to be applied

1839
02:04:09,320 --> 02:04:13,880
to automatically
you have to define all the weights okay.

1840
02:04:14,640 --> 02:04:19,080
If you want any weight to be implemented

1841
02:04:19,080 --> 02:04:22,640
in your execution,
then you have to define it in your script.

1842
02:04:23,200 --> 02:04:23,720
Okay.

1843
02:04:23,720 --> 02:04:29,160
Is that clear, guys?

1844
02:04:29,160 --> 02:04:33,240
Okay.

1845
02:04:33,240 --> 02:04:36,680
Oh, the time, the time, the default type.

1846
02:04:36,680 --> 02:04:39,080
We'll be setting it ourselves.

1847
02:04:39,080 --> 02:04:41,400
The default time is zero, guys.

1848
02:04:41,400 --> 02:04:46,080
Okay.

1849
02:04:46,080 --> 02:04:48,840
Okay, so let's put in here.

1850
02:04:49,320 --> 02:04:51,640
It tells me

1851
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:54,600
Web driver

1852
02:04:54,600 --> 02:04:57,360
to wait for a

1853
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,760
certain amount of time

1854
02:05:02,680 --> 02:05:03,960
before

1855
02:05:05,200 --> 02:05:09,720
following an exception.

1856
02:05:09,720 --> 02:05:12,120
And then

1857
02:05:12,160 --> 02:05:14,400
it will only be

1858
02:05:17,440 --> 02:05:19,520
written once and

1859
02:05:20,880 --> 02:05:24,240
will be applied to the or

1860
02:05:25,840 --> 02:05:28,680
session end of the

1861
02:05:28,680 --> 02:05:30,280
execution.

1862
02:05:31,080 --> 02:05:31,720
Okay.

1863
02:05:31,720 --> 02:05:34,280
And we set that within,

1864
02:05:35,640 --> 02:05:40,560
say said the implicit weight

1865
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:51,800
is a global weight.

1866
02:05:51,800 --> 02:05:54,040
What's the definition of the exception?

1867
02:05:54,280 --> 02:05:56,040
It's an error, right?

1868
02:05:56,040 --> 02:05:59,960
So no such element exceptions, right?

1869
02:06:00,240 --> 02:06:02,880
No such window exceptions
that we just got.

1870
02:06:03,240 --> 02:06:08,320
So that's that's the error right.

1871
02:06:08,320 --> 02:06:09,160
Okay.

1872
02:06:09,480 --> 02:06:10,200
All right guys.

1873
02:06:10,200 --> 02:06:14,800
So whenever we implement
the implicit weight, okay,

1874
02:06:15,840 --> 02:06:18,000
whenever we implement implicit weight,

1875
02:06:19,080 --> 02:06:24,560
what happens is so implicit weight is

1876
02:06:26,360 --> 02:06:29,040
usually set to 20 seconds.

1877
02:06:29,520 --> 02:06:30,960
Okay?

1878
02:06:30,960 --> 02:06:34,320
So implicit weight is it

1879
02:06:34,320 --> 02:06:36,640
works with the fine element.

1880
02:06:37,680 --> 02:06:39,720
Find element method. Okay.

1881
02:06:39,720 --> 02:06:41,000
And find element method.

1882
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:44,480
We already know that it will go ahead
and identify that element.

1883
02:06:44,760 --> 02:06:45,560
Okay.

1884
02:06:45,640 --> 02:06:49,080
So what happens in there if your element,

1885
02:06:49,080 --> 02:06:53,520
if you're trying to find an element
and if your element is found

1886
02:06:54,600 --> 02:06:57,720
in 20

1887
02:06:57,720 --> 02:07:00,240
and 20 seconds that you have mention,

1888
02:07:00,240 --> 02:07:04,480
but the rest of the time will be ignored

1889
02:07:04,480 --> 02:07:07,320
and your script will be continued.

1890
02:07:08,040 --> 02:07:10,360
Okay, so let's

1891
02:07:10,360 --> 02:07:13,880
say you set your implicit
weight for 20 seconds

1892
02:07:14,120 --> 02:07:17,280
and you try to locate the element, okay?

1893
02:07:17,680 --> 02:07:23,640
And use selenium found the element
in 5 seconds, so the rest 15 seconds

1894
02:07:23,880 --> 02:07:29,400
will be ignored and your code will
go ahead to the next line.

1895
02:07:29,760 --> 02:07:30,240
Okay.

1896
02:07:30,240 --> 02:07:38,000
Is that clear, guys?

1897
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:43,480
But if your element
is not found in the given time,

1898
02:07:43,480 --> 02:07:46,240
we we gave it, let's say,
20 seconds, right?

1899
02:07:46,800 --> 02:07:49,600
Only then you will get an exception.

1900
02:07:50,280 --> 02:07:52,000
Okay. Is that fair?

1901
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:57,480
So basically,
whenever you try to find any a what's

1902
02:07:57,480 --> 02:08:01,320
called an element, you set your implicit
weight for 20 seconds.

1903
02:08:01,640 --> 02:08:04,120
If you find if you finds that

1904
02:08:05,440 --> 02:08:06,440
that element

1905
02:08:06,440 --> 02:08:09,320
in 5 seconds, the rest 15 will be ignored.

1906
02:08:09,600 --> 02:08:12,720
Or if it if the selenium doesn't find

1907
02:08:12,920 --> 02:08:16,840
that element in 20 seconds
then you will get an exception.

1908
02:08:17,880 --> 02:08:22,840
Okay, that's a good question.

1909
02:08:22,840 --> 02:08:25,720
It will not work with find elements.

1910
02:08:25,920 --> 02:08:29,160
It will not work
with the list of elements.

1911
02:08:29,400 --> 02:08:29,880
Okay.

1912
02:08:29,880 --> 02:08:32,760
It will only work with single element.

1913
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:40,160
Okay, sure.

1914
02:08:40,400 --> 02:08:41,560
Okay, cool.

1915
02:08:41,560 --> 02:08:45,600
So let's put it here.

1916
02:08:46,120 --> 02:08:51,720
So implicit weight is usually set

1917
02:08:53,280 --> 02:08:55,440
to seconds.

1918
02:08:55,440 --> 02:08:56,800
Okay.

1919
02:08:56,800 --> 02:09:01,800
And if four elements

1920
02:09:04,280 --> 02:09:07,240
is found in

1921
02:09:10,560 --> 02:09:12,840
any time

1922
02:09:13,080 --> 02:09:15,240
between the

1923
02:09:15,280 --> 02:09:17,360
between the rest of the time.

1924
02:09:17,360 --> 02:09:21,440
All right.

1925
02:09:21,440 --> 02:09:24,720
Or let's put it between the remaining

1926
02:09:27,600 --> 02:09:28,360
time.

1927
02:09:28,360 --> 02:09:33,240
All right.

1928
02:09:33,240 --> 02:09:38,480
It said time will be

1929
02:09:39,880 --> 02:09:42,960
ignored and you're

1930
02:09:44,960 --> 02:09:46,400
script

1931
02:09:46,960 --> 02:09:49,480
will move on

1932
02:09:49,480 --> 02:09:53,320
to the next line for action.

1933
02:09:54,120 --> 02:09:56,440
Okay.

1934
02:09:56,440 --> 02:09:59,160
And if the element

1935
02:10:00,840 --> 02:10:02,920
is not found

1936
02:10:03,960 --> 02:10:05,280
in a given

1937
02:10:05,280 --> 02:10:13,200
time, only then

1938
02:10:14,760 --> 02:10:17,520
you'll get an exception

1939
02:10:21,840 --> 02:10:24,480
can you adjust the implicit weight.

1940
02:10:24,480 --> 02:10:26,560
You can adjust the waiting time

1941
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:40,720
on the implicit weight.

1942
02:10:40,720 --> 02:10:42,760
Yes, you can put more.

1943
02:10:42,760 --> 02:10:45,240
If you want to wait for 30 seconds,
you can

1944
02:10:45,480 --> 02:10:47,680
if you want to wait for 10 seconds,
that's fine.

1945
02:10:47,880 --> 02:10:51,800
But usually, guys, usually
the implicit weight

1946
02:10:51,960 --> 02:10:54,760
is always set to 20 seconds.

1947
02:10:55,200 --> 02:10:59,520
Okay.

1948
02:10:59,520 --> 02:11:00,360
All right.

1949
02:11:00,360 --> 02:11:05,480
Any other questions before we go ahead
and start the implementation,

1950
02:11:05,480 --> 02:11:21,320
guys,

1951
02:11:21,320 --> 02:11:22,440
Question

1952
02:11:28,320 --> 02:11:28,680
Okay.

1953
02:11:28,680 --> 02:11:30,400
What I do want to adjusted.

1954
02:11:30,400 --> 02:11:33,920
Okay, So let's say it's
set for 20 seconds, right?

1955
02:11:34,400 --> 02:11:37,440
But you saying that

1956
02:11:37,440 --> 02:11:40,920
so let's say your element is not found
for 20 seconds, right?

1957
02:11:41,080 --> 02:11:44,200
So what's going to happen
is going to throw you an exception.

1958
02:11:44,200 --> 02:11:47,600
So that means that
you waited for 20 seconds.

1959
02:11:48,560 --> 02:11:48,840
Right.

1960
02:11:48,840 --> 02:11:52,520
But sometimes you say that, okay,
I want this execution to be

1961
02:11:53,880 --> 02:11:57,000
to end really fast.

1962
02:11:57,000 --> 02:12:01,080
So now what I want to do, if it doesn't
if it's not found,

1963
02:12:01,320 --> 02:12:05,520
if the element is not found, I just want
to wait for 10 seconds and sets enough.

1964
02:12:06,200 --> 02:12:07,320
Okay Okay.

1965
02:12:07,320 --> 02:12:11,760
So if you set this to 10 seconds

1966
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:16,720
and your element is not found,
your execution will fail faster.

1967
02:12:16,720 --> 02:12:17,440
Okay.

1968
02:12:18,160 --> 02:12:21,120
But if it's not found in ten elements

1969
02:12:22,320 --> 02:12:25,720
in 10 seconds,
then you will get an exception.

1970
02:12:25,720 --> 02:12:31,040
But if it's found inside that 10 seconds,
then your script will move on.

1971
02:12:31,440 --> 02:12:32,280
Okay.

1972
02:12:32,280 --> 02:12:36,080
So this, as I said, the implicit weight

1973
02:12:37,320 --> 02:12:41,000
that the time is not really adjusted
frequency.

1974
02:12:41,440 --> 02:12:42,200
Okay.

1975
02:12:42,240 --> 02:12:45,640
So as I set, it sets usually to 20 seconds

1976
02:12:45,640 --> 02:12:48,680
and it applies for the whole session.

1977
02:12:49,200 --> 02:12:49,800
Okay.

1978
02:12:49,800 --> 02:12:52,480
So it's not really
you will be playing around

1979
02:12:52,480 --> 02:12:56,240
with the implicit weights timing
and all that stuff.

1980
02:12:56,240 --> 02:12:57,320
It's not like that.

1981
02:12:57,320 --> 02:13:01,640
You will set the implicit way
once before the execution.

1982
02:13:02,760 --> 02:13:03,280
Okay.

1983
02:13:03,280 --> 02:13:06,320
And all the and after that your

1984
02:13:06,920 --> 02:13:09,840
implicit way will be set to the amount
that you gave it to.

1985
02:13:10,120 --> 02:13:14,320
And it will be waiting for those elements
whenever you try to find them

1986
02:13:14,560 --> 02:13:16,480
for the given time that you set.

1987
02:13:16,480 --> 02:13:21,480
Okay.

1988
02:13:21,480 --> 02:13:26,640
All right.

1989
02:13:26,640 --> 02:13:29,120
Let me create a class in here

1990
02:13:34,120 --> 02:13:36,720
and simply demo

1991
02:13:41,280 --> 02:13:41,840
for now.

1992
02:13:41,840 --> 02:13:43,240
It is optional.

1993
02:13:43,240 --> 02:13:45,400
For now it is optional,
but when you land them

1994
02:13:46,520 --> 02:13:51,400
on a job and you work on the projects,
it is mandatory.

1995
02:13:51,680 --> 02:13:52,280
Okay?

1996
02:13:52,280 --> 02:13:54,480
Because this is going to be applied
only once

1997
02:13:54,480 --> 02:13:57,600
and it's going to be only written
once in framework.

1998
02:13:57,960 --> 02:14:01,880
Okay, So here since we having different
different execution points

1999
02:14:02,280 --> 02:14:05,200
that we have to write it all over again.

2000
02:14:05,280 --> 02:14:05,640
Right.

2001
02:14:05,640 --> 02:14:09,320
But when you try to work on the framework,
you'll only have to write it once.

2002
02:14:09,720 --> 02:14:15,000
Okay.

2003
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:16,880
Just once. Yes, just one in the framework

2004
02:14:23,520 --> 02:14:24,360
you can type as well.

2005
02:14:24,360 --> 02:14:27,240
Guys, this one is not
that is not that difficult.

2006
02:14:27,960 --> 02:14:30,080
Okay.

2007
02:14:30,080 --> 02:14:38,280
So let's see.

2008
02:14:38,280 --> 02:14:40,320
See where

2009
02:14:45,320 --> 02:14:47,520
this goes? This

2010
02:15:09,680 --> 02:15:10,040
All right.

2011
02:15:10,040 --> 02:15:10,800
I guess so.

2012
02:15:10,800 --> 02:15:14,760
What I want to do, I want to make sure

2013
02:15:17,880 --> 02:15:18,760
I know.

2014
02:15:18,960 --> 02:15:22,040
Okay, So what I want to do, guys,
I just want to navigate

2015
02:15:22,040 --> 02:15:25,520
to this Web page and here.

2016
02:15:25,520 --> 02:15:26,200
Okay.

2017
02:15:26,200 --> 02:15:30,600
And this might load some

2018
02:15:32,160 --> 02:15:34,920
some elements
a little bit later than expected.

2019
02:15:34,920 --> 02:15:35,280
Okay.

2020
02:15:35,280 --> 02:15:37,840
So what we're going to do,
we're going to set an implicit weight

2021
02:15:38,080 --> 02:15:40,920
and we will try to click on

2022
02:15:40,920 --> 02:15:44,160
this, start the same element.

2023
02:15:44,280 --> 02:15:49,880
Okay So so once you navigate to the URA,

2024
02:15:50,080 --> 02:15:53,800
okay, guys, once you opened up a page and

2025
02:15:54,960 --> 02:15:59,560
you try to perform some actions, okay,
so before you perform any actions,

2026
02:15:59,840 --> 02:16:03,280
what you want to do,
you want to set your implicit width.

2027
02:16:03,600 --> 02:16:06,720
Okay, So how you want to do it,
it's pretty easy.

2028
02:16:07,120 --> 02:16:10,920
So driver dot manage.

2029
02:16:11,240 --> 02:16:16,560
Okay, so you need to manage
so if, if you run out of time,

2030
02:16:16,680 --> 02:16:20,560
what's going to happen guys?

2031
02:16:20,560 --> 02:16:24,840
If you let's say if your element
is not found in 20 seconds,

2032
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:32,920
what's going to happen.

2033
02:16:32,920 --> 02:16:33,920
Exception. Right.

2034
02:16:33,920 --> 02:16:38,160
In other words,
it will be a timeout, right?

2035
02:16:38,400 --> 02:16:41,280
So what we what we're doing here, we're

2036
02:16:41,280 --> 02:16:45,120
managing timeouts.

2037
02:16:45,120 --> 02:16:45,320
Okay.

2038
02:16:46,760 --> 02:16:48,760
So with managing timeouts

2039
02:16:48,760 --> 02:16:51,160
by implicitly wait

2040
02:16:51,920 --> 02:16:56,040
by implicitly
waiting for some time in here.

2041
02:16:56,200 --> 02:16:56,960
Okay.

2042
02:16:57,120 --> 02:16:59,280
So for managing the timeout

2043
02:16:59,600 --> 02:17:04,560
by the implicitly wait in here
and what we need to do inside

2044
02:17:04,680 --> 02:17:07,600
parentheses, we need to,

2045
02:17:07,680 --> 02:17:09,680
we need to set the time

2046
02:17:09,680 --> 02:17:11,800
which we will be waiting for.

2047
02:17:12,640 --> 02:17:16,280
And as I said in here,
we waiting for 20 seconds, right?

2048
02:17:16,280 --> 02:17:17,800
This is the usual time.

2049
02:17:17,800 --> 02:17:20,600
So if we put in here 20, that means.

2050
02:17:20,800 --> 02:17:25,760
And the second argument
that we need to pass is the time unit.

2051
02:17:26,640 --> 02:17:29,040
Okay, so

2052
02:17:29,280 --> 02:17:33,000
our time units in here
is going to be seconds,

2053
02:17:33,040 --> 02:17:36,600
or if you want to wait four days,
you can do this in here.

2054
02:17:36,760 --> 02:17:39,680
If you want to wait 4 hours,
you can do this as well.

2055
02:17:40,040 --> 02:17:43,000
Okay, So timeout seconds in here.

2056
02:17:43,840 --> 02:17:46,480
I'm in time units. Sorry.

2057
02:17:46,480 --> 02:17:49,360
So this is the

2058
02:17:49,960 --> 02:17:53,960
the script
how you set your implicit weight.

2059
02:17:54,600 --> 02:17:55,080
Okay.

2060
02:17:55,080 --> 02:17:57,840
So pretty easy using web driver.

2061
02:17:57,840 --> 02:17:59,520
You're managing the timeouts, you're

2062
02:17:59,520 --> 02:18:01,800
managing the timeouts of the implicit
weights.

2063
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:02,640
Right.

2064
02:18:02,640 --> 02:18:06,000
And you just set here 20 seconds.

2065
02:18:06,200 --> 02:18:08,920
That's it.

2066
02:18:08,920 --> 02:18:09,600
All right.

2067
02:18:09,840 --> 02:18:17,440
Any questions, guys?

2068
02:18:17,440 --> 02:18:18,640
Yes, it will.

2069
02:18:18,640 --> 02:18:20,760
It will wait until it's found.

2070
02:18:20,760 --> 02:18:24,840
Yes, if it's found,
if it's found in 5 seconds,

2071
02:18:25,040 --> 02:18:27,120
the rest of the time will be ignored.

2072
02:18:27,120 --> 02:18:28,720
Guys, remember that

2073
02:18:41,040 --> 02:18:43,440
you want
to wait four days and you get paid hourly.

2074
02:18:43,760 --> 02:18:44,440
Good.

2075
02:18:45,400 --> 02:18:47,760
But then you're
not going to get the job done.

2076
02:18:47,760 --> 02:18:54,560
So that means you're not going to get paid
after that.

2077
02:18:54,560 --> 02:18:56,760
We're better than 30 sleep. Yes.

2078
02:18:56,760 --> 02:18:59,760
So from now on, guys try to use

2079
02:19:00,760 --> 02:19:02,280
weights

2080
02:19:02,560 --> 02:19:10,840
instead of thread that sleep.

2081
02:19:10,840 --> 02:19:15,240
Isn't it better to put more time
if the computer system is not fast enough?

2082
02:19:15,440 --> 02:19:20,040
As I said before, your computer system
system has nothing to do with this.

2083
02:19:20,480 --> 02:19:21,080
Right?

2084
02:19:21,080 --> 02:19:24,440
Because when when your execution starts

2085
02:19:25,320 --> 02:19:27,800
right, it will not wait for anything.

2086
02:19:27,800 --> 02:19:31,960
It's just going to run and open up a page.

2087
02:19:31,960 --> 02:19:32,600
Right.

2088
02:19:32,600 --> 02:19:36,800
So you might want to check the Internet
speed guys.

2089
02:19:36,800 --> 02:19:41,880
If it's too slow, then you might want
to increase the time in here.

2090
02:19:42,360 --> 02:19:43,040
Okay.

2091
02:19:43,480 --> 02:19:47,080
Or if the server is down
or the server is too

2092
02:19:47,120 --> 02:19:51,280
slow guys, only
then you may need to increase this time.

2093
02:19:51,560 --> 02:19:56,560
But if if the element is not sound in 20
seconds guys,

2094
02:19:56,720 --> 02:19:59,840
there is a problem with the performance
of your server or writing.

2095
02:20:00,480 --> 02:20:06,320
Okay. Yes.

2096
02:20:06,320 --> 02:20:11,240
I can explain why that that sleep
is not the best way.

2097
02:20:11,240 --> 02:20:12,720
So in thread dot sleep guys.

2098
02:20:12,720 --> 02:20:16,200
So let's say
we try to wait for an element, right?

2099
02:20:16,200 --> 02:20:18,480
We're trying to wait
for an element for 2 seconds.

2100
02:20:18,760 --> 02:20:20,200
What if that element of

2101
02:20:21,240 --> 02:20:22,760
pops up in 5 seconds?

2102
02:20:22,760 --> 02:20:31,560
Guess what's going to happen?

2103
02:20:31,560 --> 02:20:34,720
It won't ignore.
It's going to fail, right?

2104
02:20:34,840 --> 02:20:39,160
So you have to talk to 2 seconds of wait
time, okay?

2105
02:20:40,080 --> 02:20:41,480
2 seconds of wait time.

2106
02:20:41,480 --> 02:20:45,480
So if it appears in 3 seconds,
that means you already failed.

2107
02:20:45,480 --> 02:20:46,800
It won't work. Right.

2108
02:20:46,800 --> 02:20:49,520
What's here in the implicit wait, guys?

2109
02:20:49,720 --> 02:20:54,520
What happens is, even though you mentioned
20 seconds, okay,

2110
02:20:54,840 --> 02:20:59,720
if it finds the element in 5 seconds,
it will ignore the rest.

2111
02:20:59,720 --> 02:21:00,880
15 seconds.

2112
02:21:00,880 --> 02:21:05,160
Okay,
so your code is moving on after 5 seconds

2113
02:21:05,400 --> 02:21:13,680
after it found that element.

2114
02:21:13,680 --> 02:21:19,440
And you might ask what happens
if the element takes more than 20 seconds

2115
02:21:19,440 --> 02:21:20,840
to appear?

2116
02:21:20,840 --> 02:21:23,840
That means that your server has some

2117
02:21:23,840 --> 02:21:24,680
some issues.

2118
02:21:24,680 --> 02:21:26,880
It's a performance issue off the server.

2119
02:21:26,880 --> 02:21:35,600
Okay, great.

2120
02:21:35,600 --> 02:21:36,360
Every time.

2121
02:21:37,680 --> 02:21:38,760
No. So

2122
02:21:38,760 --> 02:21:42,280
there's
no downsides of using the implicit weight

2123
02:21:42,280 --> 02:21:45,360
because you will only be mentioning it
once.

2124
02:21:45,360 --> 02:21:47,280
Okay, so you just mentioned it once.

2125
02:21:47,280 --> 02:21:48,120
That's it.

2126
02:21:48,840 --> 02:21:52,760
The only the only downside
I would think of is

2127
02:21:52,760 --> 02:21:55,960
when it's it only applies to find element.

2128
02:21:56,880 --> 02:21:57,920
Okay.

2129
02:21:57,920 --> 02:22:00,160
Even though your element is found.

2130
02:22:00,160 --> 02:22:04,400
But it's not if it's if it's disabled
and you want to click on it,

2131
02:22:04,400 --> 02:22:07,680
it will not throw that error
because your element is found

2132
02:22:07,920 --> 02:22:10,520
and you want to click on it
and it's disabled.

2133
02:22:10,560 --> 02:22:13,160
It's not going to look for the disabled
elements.

2134
02:22:13,440 --> 02:22:24,840
Okay, wait.

2135
02:22:24,840 --> 02:22:26,960
Time will apply,

2136
02:22:27,600 --> 02:22:28,840
correct? Yes.

2137
02:22:28,840 --> 02:22:34,000
All the actions, all the find element
dies, all the find element actions.

2138
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:34,680
Okay.

2139
02:22:34,680 --> 02:22:37,520
So if I do, let me go back.

2140
02:22:37,520 --> 02:22:39,000
Where was that?

2141
02:22:39,200 --> 02:22:39,840
Okay.

2142
02:22:39,840 --> 02:22:42,560
If I find these three elements.

2143
02:22:42,600 --> 02:22:43,920
Okay, let me copy this.

2144
02:22:43,920 --> 02:22:45,960
Let's say these are the elements.

2145
02:22:46,120 --> 02:22:47,880
Okay, So

2146
02:22:49,480 --> 02:22:52,200
if it's trying to find the first element.

2147
02:22:52,760 --> 02:22:55,440
It will start checking to 20 seconds.

2148
02:22:55,680 --> 02:22:56,280
Okay.

2149
02:22:56,280 --> 02:23:00,400
Once it's found that element in 2 seconds,
the rest will be ignored.

2150
02:23:00,600 --> 02:23:04,360
Now, it will try to look into this
element.

2151
02:23:05,040 --> 02:23:07,760
Okay, 20 seconds start ticking in there.

2152
02:23:07,960 --> 02:23:10,680
And then after that, if if it

2153
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:15,240
if it this is found in 5 seconds,
the rest 16 will be ignored

2154
02:23:15,400 --> 02:23:19,680
and the selenium
will try to find this element.

2155
02:23:19,680 --> 02:23:22,560
And if it doesn't find that element
in 20 seconds

2156
02:23:22,760 --> 02:23:25,680
only, then it will throw an exception.

2157
02:23:26,400 --> 02:23:27,320
Okay.

2158
02:23:27,320 --> 02:23:32,480
Is that clear, guys?

2159
02:23:32,480 --> 02:23:41,840
Any other questions?

2160
02:23:41,840 --> 02:23:43,200
Okay, good.

2161
02:23:44,040 --> 02:23:47,320
All right, so

2162
02:23:47,320 --> 02:23:49,200
let me get this.

2163
02:23:49,200 --> 02:23:51,920
So let's go back in here.
So we navigate here.

2164
02:23:51,920 --> 02:23:56,040
So what I want to do,
I want to click on this, start practicing.

2165
02:23:56,600 --> 02:23:59,000
Okay, So let's

2166
02:24:00,160 --> 02:24:00,920
see what

2167
02:24:00,920 --> 02:24:05,400
this one.

2168
02:24:05,400 --> 02:24:07,840
Okay, It has an ID here. Okay.

2169
02:24:08,520 --> 02:24:11,040
So I'm going to use the ID, I'm going to

2170
02:24:11,040 --> 02:24:14,400
find this element by its ID
and then I'll try to click it.

2171
02:24:14,520 --> 02:24:15,200
Okay.

2172
02:24:15,840 --> 02:24:18,480
So web element

2173
02:24:21,160 --> 02:24:23,160
practicing

2174
02:24:23,960 --> 02:24:25,280
is the driver.

2175
02:24:25,280 --> 02:24:30,360
That element ID

2176
02:24:31,680 --> 02:24:33,920
and is this ID?

2177
02:24:34,080 --> 02:24:40,840
And here.

2178
02:24:40,840 --> 02:24:42,880
So practicing button that

2179
02:24:43,960 --> 02:24:46,440
click.

2180
02:24:46,440 --> 02:24:49,320
Okay. All right.

2181
02:24:49,320 --> 02:24:51,360
Yes I'll push I'll click the code state.

2182
02:24:51,360 --> 02:24:52,040
Okay.

2183
02:24:52,480 --> 02:24:53,360
So give me some time.

2184
02:24:53,360 --> 02:25:02,600
Let me explain this one and I'll go,
Oh, yeah, they spelled it wrong.

2185
02:25:02,600 --> 02:25:05,760
Okay, good. Catch the catch. There you go.

2186
02:25:05,760 --> 02:25:11,520
You have a defect.

2187
02:25:11,520 --> 02:25:12,000
Okay.

2188
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:16,520
Can you write this anywhere
or it should be in the top class.

2189
02:25:16,680 --> 02:25:18,960
Okay, so if you write it.

2190
02:25:18,960 --> 02:25:20,640
So let me cut this.

2191
02:25:20,640 --> 02:25:23,040
And if you write it in here,
what's going to happen, guys?

2192
02:25:23,400 --> 02:25:26,800
Will this be applied to this web

2193
02:25:26,800 --> 02:25:30,600
element?

2194
02:25:30,600 --> 02:25:31,200
No. Right.

2195
02:25:31,200 --> 02:25:34,720
Because our code is going from
top to the bottom left to the right.

2196
02:25:35,880 --> 02:25:36,240
Right.

2197
02:25:36,240 --> 02:25:41,240
So you have to mention this
at the very top after you

2198
02:25:41,240 --> 02:25:45,960
navigate to the edge
so that this implicit weight

2199
02:25:46,200 --> 02:25:49,040
gets applied to whole session.

2200
02:25:49,200 --> 02:25:55,760
Okay.

2201
02:25:55,760 --> 02:25:56,360
All right.

2202
02:25:56,360 --> 02:25:58,200
So now

2203
02:26:00,040 --> 02:26:01,520
let's go ahead and run this

2204
02:26:01,520 --> 02:26:18,400
and see what's going to happen.

2205
02:26:18,400 --> 02:26:19,120
Okay?

2206
02:26:19,520 --> 02:26:20,520
I think it already did.

2207
02:26:20,520 --> 02:26:22,080
Yeah, it clicked. Right?

2208
02:26:22,080 --> 02:26:23,480
So seems like it.

2209
02:26:23,480 --> 02:26:24,520
It just popped up.

2210
02:26:24,520 --> 02:26:27,160
So see you
guys. It's not waiting anything.

2211
02:26:27,160 --> 02:26:30,920
It's just clicking right away
whenever it finds that element.

2212
02:26:31,360 --> 02:26:36,000
So now what
I am going to do, I'm going to put a

2213
02:26:36,560 --> 02:26:39,240
it wrong ID even here,
so I'm going to do this.

2214
02:26:40,280 --> 02:26:42,240
Okay, so this is a wrong ID,

2215
02:26:42,240 --> 02:26:44,720
This doesn't even exist
in the HTML, right?

2216
02:26:45,240 --> 02:26:48,840
So what I can do here, I'm
going to run this.

2217
02:26:49,440 --> 02:26:52,680
So now let's see
when we're going to get that

2218
02:26:52,680 --> 02:26:58,920
exception.

2219
02:26:58,920 --> 02:27:01,360
Okay.

2220
02:27:01,360 --> 02:27:04,240
Landed on the page.
Okay, We're still here.

2221
02:27:04,880 --> 02:27:08,880
So you guys,
we don't have an exception yet.

2222
02:27:09,480 --> 02:27:11,800
Okay, So we still here.

2223
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,760
It's still looking for that element.

2224
02:27:14,760 --> 02:27:15,160
Okay?

2225
02:27:15,200 --> 02:27:19,640
It's still giving it a chance.

2226
02:27:19,640 --> 02:27:20,360
There we go.

2227
02:27:21,480 --> 02:27:22,160
Okay, so

2228
02:27:22,160 --> 02:27:25,760
now, guys, only after the 20 seconds,

2229
02:27:25,920 --> 02:27:29,880
you can see that there's no such element
exception.

2230
02:27:30,520 --> 02:27:33,200
Okay, So we set it to 20 seconds.

2231
02:27:33,320 --> 02:27:37,680
So it's waiting for that element
to find right to appear

2232
02:27:37,680 --> 02:27:43,360
or to be to be present in that web page,
but it's not present.

2233
02:27:43,680 --> 02:27:46,440
So then it will wait for 20 seconds

2234
02:27:46,440 --> 02:27:48,920
and we will throw our exception.

2235
02:27:50,520 --> 02:27:51,400
Okay.

2236
02:27:51,400 --> 02:28:01,920
Any questions, guys?

2237
02:28:01,920 --> 02:28:03,840
Any questions on Windows?

2238
02:28:03,840 --> 02:28:22,680
Any questions on Waits guys?

2239
02:28:22,680 --> 02:28:23,920
Yeah, this one is easy.

2240
02:28:23,920 --> 02:28:26,320
Implicit word is easy.

2241
02:28:26,320 --> 02:28:30,640
Well, the weights in selenium are easy
because they're all straightforward.

2242
02:28:30,920 --> 02:28:31,560
Okay?

2243
02:28:31,560 --> 02:28:36,240
I mean, selenium is easy anyways,
because there is a lot of stuff

2244
02:28:36,240 --> 02:28:44,760
that is just simple English.

2245
02:28:44,760 --> 02:28:46,320
Yeah. Yeah.

2246
02:28:46,320 --> 02:28:55,440
There's a lot of information
that is correct.

2247
02:28:55,440 --> 02:28:57,120
Yes, we know. Handles.

2248
02:28:57,120 --> 02:28:58,280
You need to practice.

2249
02:28:58,280 --> 02:29:03,480
Okay.

2250
02:29:03,480 --> 02:29:05,040
Okay. So

2251
02:29:06,440 --> 02:29:09,240
let's let's push the code, guys,

2252
02:29:09,240 --> 02:29:11,920
before we that before we do that,

2253
02:29:11,920 --> 02:29:21,440
let's go through the homework guys.

2254
02:29:21,440 --> 02:29:25,320
This here.

2255
02:29:25,320 --> 02:29:26,160
Okay.

2256
02:29:26,400 --> 02:29:27,680
All right, Guess so.

2257
02:29:27,680 --> 02:29:31,520
Let me explain. You

2258
02:29:31,960 --> 02:29:33,000
this one.

2259
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:40,080
So let's go back.

2260
02:29:40,080 --> 02:29:41,000
Okay.

2261
02:29:41,480 --> 02:29:44,600
So here's what I need you to do.

2262
02:29:44,600 --> 02:29:44,960
Guys.

2263
02:29:44,960 --> 02:29:47,960
I need you to click on these

2264
02:29:48,600 --> 02:29:57,000
on these buttons, okay?

2265
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:57,640
Okay.

2266
02:29:57,640 --> 02:30:03,360
So let's see, we on new tab and then print
the text from the tab in the console.

2267
02:30:03,360 --> 02:30:06,000
Okay. So let's click on this.

2268
02:30:06,960 --> 02:30:07,640
There you go.

2269
02:30:07,640 --> 02:30:10,400
So you have this text,
you need to print that out.

2270
02:30:10,800 --> 02:30:15,640
You click on this one, you need to
print that out and you click on this one.

2271
02:30:15,920 --> 02:30:18,480
You print that out as well.

2272
02:30:18,480 --> 02:30:19,320
Okay?

2273
02:30:20,200 --> 02:30:23,600
So where verify the

2274
02:30:24,800 --> 02:30:28,200
title is displayed.

2275
02:30:28,240 --> 02:30:28,760
Okay?

2276
02:30:28,760 --> 02:30:31,840
And then print out the titles

2277
02:30:31,840 --> 02:30:37,920
of all the pages.

2278
02:30:37,920 --> 02:30:38,680
Okay.

2279
02:30:38,680 --> 02:30:42,120
Is that clear, guys,

2280
02:30:42,120 --> 02:30:48,760
for this task?

2281
02:30:48,760 --> 02:30:50,800
Okay. And then the second one

2282
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:55,120
here.

2283
02:30:55,560 --> 02:30:59,760
Okay, what I want you to do guys in here,
I want you to click on this link.

2284
02:31:00,400 --> 02:31:01,240
Okay?

2285
02:31:01,240 --> 02:31:03,880
When you click on this Link,

2286
02:31:04,120 --> 02:31:06,520
it's going to wait for a little bit
and then

2287
02:31:08,160 --> 02:31:10,360
it's going to display this text.

2288
02:31:10,360 --> 02:31:11,320
Okay.

2289
02:31:11,320 --> 02:31:15,880
So get this text
and then print it out in the console.

2290
02:31:16,520 --> 02:31:23,160
Okay? Yes.

2291
02:31:23,160 --> 02:31:25,200
This is the homework. Yes. Okay.

2292
02:31:25,920 --> 02:31:55,320
Any questions on this, guys?

2293
02:31:55,320 --> 02:31:58,520
Okay, one second.

2294
02:31:58,520 --> 02:32:12,240
Let me check your.

2295
02:32:12,240 --> 02:32:13,440
Okay, guys.

2296
02:32:13,440 --> 02:32:17,520
Seems like I don't have anything else,
so I'm giving you 20 minutes

2297
02:32:18,520 --> 02:32:19,800
back of your time.

2298
02:32:19,800 --> 02:32:24,040
But I want to say one thing, that tomorrow
is going to be intense, guys.

2299
02:32:24,040 --> 02:32:24,880
Okay?

2300
02:32:24,920 --> 02:32:29,760
Tomorrow
we will going over the explicit weights.

2301
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,360
Tomorrow we will be going over the

2302
02:32:34,760 --> 02:32:35,880
flow and weights

2303
02:32:35,880 --> 02:32:38,760
and we will be working with tables.

2304
02:32:39,280 --> 02:32:43,560
Okay, guys, Tomorrow
is going to be a lot of information.

2305
02:32:43,560 --> 02:32:44,040
Okay?

2306
02:32:45,600 --> 02:32:46,600
Yep. Go hard.

2307
02:32:46,600 --> 02:32:48,720
Go home. That is right.

2308
02:32:48,720 --> 02:32:49,080
Okay.

2309
02:32:49,080 --> 02:32:52,520
So tomorrow
we will have a little bit of intense class

2310
02:32:53,120 --> 02:32:55,560
because going to be a lot of different
information.

2311
02:32:56,560 --> 02:32:57,280
Okay.

2312
02:32:57,640 --> 02:32:58,880
Rough day tomorrow, guys.
