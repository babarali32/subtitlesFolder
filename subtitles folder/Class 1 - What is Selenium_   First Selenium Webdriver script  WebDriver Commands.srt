1
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,720
All right.

2
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,640
I guess I guess we have enough people
right now to get started.

3
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,200
And it's already 705.

4
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,160
Okay.

5
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,320
Hi, everyone.

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,360
My name is Allie.

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,440
So this is your first selenium class.

8
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,360
And welcome to the Selenium class.

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,960
This is where all the fun starts.

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,200
Okay?

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,920
And I'm going to be with you guys
for the whole

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,480
Selenium process class,
and we'll see how it goes.

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,880
Okay,
So I hope you guys are doing great in Java

14
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,840
because we are going to be integrating
Java with Selenium

15
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,240
and I hope everyone is

16
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,440
got the JAR files for selenium,

17
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,800
import it and create a new project already
inside there.

18
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,840
Intelligent.

19
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,880
I think that was the

20
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,760
prerequisite before this class.

21
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,520
Right.

22
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,520
Is there anyone who is having problems

23
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,000
with with installing
and setting up selenium

24
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:25,800
in your

25
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:38,640
intelligent guys?

26
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,920
No issues. Okay.

27
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,360
So it should be pretty simple, right?

28
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,040
If you if you are having issues,
please post it in syntax support.

29
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,760
We should be able to

30
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,840
to take a look at it and

31
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,080
and take a look at the videos in YouTube.

32
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,000
They should be really straightforward
and easy.

33
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,200
Everything goes step by step
and it's not that difficult to set it up.

34
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,720
Okay. All right.

35
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,680
So how the class are going to go?

36
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,360
So I'm going to go over
the theoretical part first.

37
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,080
Okay.

38
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,760
That's the boring part
where, um, not everybody.

39
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,600
Like,

40
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,880
so I'm going to go

41
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,360
over the theoretical part and then what
we're going to do, we're going to go over

42
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,120
the implementation,
we're going to dive into coding

43
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,240
and we're going to see what we can do
with Selenium, right?

44
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,160
So I promise you guys,
Selenium is more fun than Java.

45
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,120
So it's not
that it's not always seeing some

46
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,680
some output in console,
but what we're going to be doing

47
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:44,560
will be interacting with the browsers
and we will be writing a lot of

48
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,640
logic and building a lot of logic
to interact

49
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,760
with browsers and performing
a lot of actions in the browser.

50
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,560
Okay. All right.

51
00:02:53,560 --> 00:03:05,240
So before we get started,
any questions, guys?

52
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,640
Like not So please,
please try to be active

53
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,080
in the chat glasses since I don't see you,
I don't see what's going on.

54
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,600
I don't even know what's going on
if you don't answer in the live chat.

55
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,600
Okay, so I'll be asking a lot of questions

56
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,600
who will be interacting with each other?

57
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,360
Okay, so please, please

58
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,640
pay attention
and try to answer and life questions

59
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,080
whenever there is a question
so that I know what is going on.

60
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:42,640
Okay.

61
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,840
All right, cool.

62
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,920
Okay. So

63
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:53,040
before we get started,
so let me actually create

64
00:03:53,240 --> 00:04:04,360
one folder in here
so that we can keep our notes in here.

65
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:10,320
I've just created here,
so I'm going to put it as notes, right.

66
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,520
So I'll have notes in here so that

67
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:15,840
so that you

68
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,800
guys, I'll type in some notes for you.

69
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,160
Okay.

70
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,200
During the class guys

71
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,280
so that it's easier for you to recap
what we've done through the classes.

72
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,880
And I'm going to be pointing out
all the important stuff in here.

73
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,720
Okay.

74
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,040
So we're just seeing a little background.

75
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,440
Okay.

76
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,800
So other instructors, they don't do this.

77
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,840
They put some background in there.

78
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,800
Okay.

79
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,360
Yeah. If you want to use Eclipse.

80
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,520
Yeah,
that's fine. It's not a big deal. Okay.

81
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,920
But we will be doing the same thing
anyway.

82
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:52,680
So as long as your selenium is working
and you have Java installed,

83
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,480
that's fine.

84
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,600
All right, so

85
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,480
let's put it here

86
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,920
and let's do

87
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,240
this.

88
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,800
I forgot how it was the other one.

89
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,160
Okay.

90
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,600
Okay.

91
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,640
So the notes.

92
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:30,520
The notes are the notes
and code is going to be in GitHub, right?

93
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,000
The slides are going to be in canvas.

94
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,360
Okay, guys.

95
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,400
So that's why I'm
putting everything all the notes in here

96
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,600
inside the project that we're doing.

97
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,080
And then whenever I push the code, you
could just pull it to you, to your stuff.

98
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,520
Okay, I'll push the code

99
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,480
at the end of the of the class.

100
00:05:53,480 --> 00:06:05,640
Okay.

101
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,880
Do I suggest to write everything with me
at the same time

102
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,560
if you can? Yes.

103
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:17,080
But sometimes I will really need you
to listen, but not to type.

104
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,920
Okay,
so this is the once we just starting.

105
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:24,840
It's easy stuff, but when we go forward,
we will be having some different,

106
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,720
different topics.

107
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,080
And that's we're going

108
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,800
to have some challenges in there
that I need to explain to you.

109
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,440
So it would be great to listen to me first
and then type the code in.

110
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,160
Okay,

111
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,320
But anyways, you're going to have the code
and at the end of the day

112
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,960
or after the class
so that you can pull it to yourself.

113
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,480
Okay, well, what are doing from scratch?

114
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,640
Okay, class 27 is for Java.

115
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,960
Okay, so this one is going to be class
first for selenium.

116
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,000
Okay, so you guys are going to be doing

117
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,320
two different things right now
at the same time.

118
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,400
But there is a little bit left
for you to finish Java, I guess.

119
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,160
I'm not sure where you are yet,
but I think you have a couple of classes

120
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,400
left, like, if I'm not mistaken, three
or four classes left for Java.

121
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,760
Okay, so we don't.

122
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,520
Yeah, six, 6 to 7 classes.

123
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,320
There you go. Yeah.

124
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,960
So we will be doing it simultaneously.

125
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,040
So we're adding more fun.

126
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,200
As I said, not just Java.

127
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,320
What's one? Okay.

128
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,560
I don't know
if everybody heard me in the beginning.

129
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,760
My name is Ali, guys.

130
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:38,520
Okay,
so I will be your instructor facility.

131
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:38,880
Okay.

132
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,960
Any other questions before

133
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:53,280
we get started, guys?

134
00:07:53,280 --> 00:08:03,680
Separate pool.

135
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,560
Okay. Yes.

136
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,480
Drivers are going to be located
only in the folder.

137
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,080
Yes. For this project.

138
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:17,360
That is correct.

139
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,000
The project you guys created right.

140
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,320
Should you put drivers in other projects?

141
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,160
Yes. Will will be coming to those points.

142
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:27,720
Okay, guys.

143
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,000
So let's just go step by step.

144
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,480
Okay.

145
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:35,160
So we have drivers in in our project.

146
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,120
We have selenium libraries,
right in our project.

147
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:43,400
So let's finish the Selenium project
and then we will see how everything goes,

148
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:47,400
how we can manage all the drivers
and everything once we start

149
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,160
going into building the framework.

150
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,600
Okay, step by step, guys. One by one.

151
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,280
Okay.

152
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,440
All right.

153
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:03,240
Any other questions?

154
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,320
Okay, cool.

155
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,880
All right, so let's get started.

156
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,440
Right? As I said, boring time,

157
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,200
Boring time, theoretical time.

158
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,400
So from theoretical part, guys,
I like to interact with you guys

159
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,840
so that I can see how you guys think
and what you guys think about this topic.

160
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,040
Okay,
so since it's our first selenium class,

161
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,720
let's go ahead and get started
with this simple question.

162
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,720
What is this software testing, right?

163
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,440
Since we will be automation testers
after we finish this course.

164
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,120
So what is

165
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,320
software testing us?

166
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,240
What do we know about software testing,
how it works?

167
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,920
What are we doing
whenever we say it's testing right?

168
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,000
What are we trying to do?

169
00:09:49,000 --> 00:10:09,840
What's the purpose?

170
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,160
Automatic monitor.

171
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,040
Okay, on my screen,
we'll see you guys will see.

172
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,160
Well, the the main part.

173
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,800
The main part
you need my screen to see. Okay.

174
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:46,320
The the notes and the code.

175
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:46,760
Okay.

176
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:51,640
So the software testing is we're checking
if the application that we're working on

177
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,800
is working or not.

178
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,440
Okay.

179
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,800
We're checking the requirements
impact right?

180
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,160
So basically what we're doing,
we're testing the software for making

181
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,320
sure the functionality
works properly, right?

182
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:12,480
So we basically what we're doing
is we're identifying the correctness

183
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,400
and the quality of the application.

184
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,200
Right. Checking for bugs.
Absolutely right.

185
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,520
So what we do,
what is software testing is to identify

186
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,240
correctness and

187
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,640
quality

188
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,080
of the application, right?

189
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,680
So basically you go inside the website,
whatever your project

190
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,440
is, wherever the application is,
you start clicking right

191
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,160
based on the requirements
you are given, right?

192
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,520
So, okay, so we identified
what's going on with software testing,

193
00:11:51,520 --> 00:12:02,280
but how many ways
can we actually test guys?

194
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,760
Okay, two ways.

195
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,800
So there's two ways of testing, right?

196
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:10,080
One is manual
and one is automation, right?

197
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:14,040
I think you guys already done
the manual part where you

198
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,400
where you've done the test cases, right?

199
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,560
Where you did
the stats for the test cases, extracted

200
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,560
values, Um, actual values, Right.

201
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,400
So let's go ahead and put here manual

202
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,480
and automation.

203
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:38,080
All right, you guys a little bit
did that in the first classes, right?

204
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:42,520
I didn't I didn't think it was a
lot of classes in there. But

205
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,240
anyway, so

206
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,000
you're already familiar
with with manual testing.

207
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,480
So when, when do we go for automation now?

208
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,560
So we said there's two ways to test
the application manual in automation.

209
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,360
So we know about manual.

210
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,640
So in,

211
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,920
in automation, right?

212
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,440
So when do we actually go
and start our automation

213
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,280
when we want to find where is the bug?

214
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,880
Well,
you can find it manually as well, right?

215
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,840
You can find bugs manually as well.

216
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,320
The after manual testing is passed, right?

217
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:36,360
So once you you do you do all the tracks
for your manual, right?

218
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,520
So whenever you're given a task,
what you try to do, you go

219
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,520
try to log into the website
right to that project or application.

220
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,040
You're checking it manually first.

221
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,720
So once that is fine
and then what you can do,

222
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,560
you can start writing
your logic in your code, right?

223
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,640
So what we can do in here, we can put

224
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:03,760
after manual testing is passed, right?

225
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,840
So let's see,

226
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,280
perfect world when manual testing is done.

227
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,920
There is correct
when we have to test something repeatedly.

228
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:14,640
Okay.

229
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,240
That's a good point.

230
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,760
Right.

231
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:23,440
There are many similar projects and
we can write program to check them easily.

232
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,240
Okay.

233
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,160
We want to avoid human errors. Okay.

234
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,720
That is that is correct. Yes.

235
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,520
But the main point one,
another main point that we have in here

236
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,120
that I'm not sure if you guys

237
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,240
already talked about this

238
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,400
on manual testing classes.

239
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,360
Did you guys talk about environments

240
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,360
that you guys will be working?

241
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,440
Yes, right. Exactly. There we go.

242
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,160
So what environment
are you going to be testing,

243
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:04,680
guys?

244
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,080
Testing environment. Right.

245
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,920
So in order for you to start automation

246
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,480
or manual testing,
that environment has to be stable.

247
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,840
Okay?

248
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,560
Only then you can go ahead
and start your automation.

249
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,800
So I can put in here when

250
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,760
environment is stable.

251
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:27,680
Okay.

252
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,640
So there will be sometimes you will see

253
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,120
that you cannot reach some website, right?

254
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,600
Or you cannot go to some page
because you're getting some error.

255
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,680
So that way you won't be able to to

256
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,240
to go ahead and perform
any actions in there because you have

257
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,040
what's called

258
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,160
because you have something blocking you.

259
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:49,760
Right.

260
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,200
Okay.

261
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,600
All right.

262
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:08,720
Any questions so far, guys?

263
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,520
Okay. So another point, guys.

264
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,720
So when you just start the project, right,
when let's say

265
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:20,760
we just started the project,
we said that we we said that, hey, okay,

266
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:24,360
so this is our project we're going to be
doing manual and automation.

267
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,360
So what do you need to do

268
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,160
in order to start automation?

269
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,280
In that case, guys?

270
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,880
So what did you guys do today
before coming to class

271
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:47,760
in your intelligent, you need to prepare.

272
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:55,040
Prepare what?

273
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,000
Prerequisites. Okay, so

274
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,480
preparing your

275
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,600
requirements, automate
the code test case environment.

276
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,440
There we go.

277
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,440
You integrated selenium
with intelligent, right?

278
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,920
So what we've done, in other words,
we went ahead

279
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,760
and we downloaded selenium, right?

280
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,600
We, we just uploaded all the jar files
into our intelligent

281
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,400
and we check that it's working.

282
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:26,640
So what we did is we chose our app,
one of the automation tools, right?

283
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,760
Because we know that we will be automating
everything.

284
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,920
So Selenium is one of the automation tools
that we will be

285
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,000
using, Right?

286
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,360
Okay.

287
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:41,080
So what we've done here,
we chose was our automation tool.

288
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:45,640
So when we do, we go for automation,
when we analyze, right,

289
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,200
our test suite and

290
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,000
choose our

291
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,120
automation tools.

292
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:56,960
Okay.

293
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:03,000
So before you start any project,
you need to know whether you will be

294
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,960
going for automation or whether
you will be doing everything manually.

295
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:19,080
Okay, Any questions, guys?

296
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,000
Okay.

297
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,560
So since we talked about
automation tools, guys, what

298
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,080
what other automation tools do you know

299
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:41,280
except selenium guys?

300
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,720
Okay, So we said there is selenium, right?

301
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,760
There's you have to you

302
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,840
I think you have to
is pretty pretty outdated.

303
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,160
You have to is also I think it was cold
cuts or something like this

304
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,320
but I'm not sure.

305
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,040
There
we go. There is cucumber. Right. Cucumber.

306
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:07,040
Okay, that's good.

307
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,760
APM, APM is for mobile testing, guys.

308
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,560
Okay.

309
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,280
Okay. Test.

310
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,960
And you can include test engineer.

311
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,040
It's a framework,
but it's still it's a testing framework.

312
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,400
Okay.

313
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,520
Cucumber is another tool,
but we will be coming

314
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,560
to this a little bit later
during the during the classes.

315
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,200
Okay. Cucumber is a testing tool as well.

316
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:37,440
So there's one more tool, guys that is
getting popular a little bit nowadays,

317
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,000
but it's it's not that good.

318
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,440
I've used it a little bit.

319
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,840
It's not that really good

320
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,680
because it has a lot of bugs
inside that application itself.

321
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,240
It is called

322
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,800
Tatlong Studio.

323
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,080
So in order to use this
you have to pay for it,

324
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,840
but it still doesn't work properly.
Okay, guys.

325
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,360
So that's that's how it is right now.

326
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,720
So maybe it's a bit,
a little bit different,

327
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,680
different tool.

328
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:18,760
We we'll be using Maven as well.

329
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,160
All right.

330
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:20,800
Okay.

331
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:25,680
Moka I'm not familiar with Moka that much,
so I know it's a coffee,

332
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:29,480
but I, I don't, I don't really know
how, how it works in testing.

333
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,840
Okay.

334
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,480
All right.

335
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:35,880
All right.

336
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,000
So let's go through the levels of testing,
guys.

337
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,720
Okay?

338
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,800
Levels of testing.

339
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:54,160
We will be using Maven guys, not Kaplan.

340
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,760
Okay, So what do we know
about levels of testing?

341
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,600
Guys,
Anyone can guess Any guesses for this

342
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,840
small progression?

343
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,360
Those are those are the types. Right?

344
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,360
There we go.

345
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,760
So unit test, right?

346
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,840
This is one level of testing. Okay.

347
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,720
Who, who, who performed the unit test?

348
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,040
Guys?

349
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,680
Developers. Right. Exactly. There we go.

350
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,960
What else, guys?

351
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,200
Acceptance. Testing.

352
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,720
Okay, that's good.

353
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:46,400
Acceptance testing, system testing.

354
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,560
Absolutely right.

355
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,600
System testing.

356
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,280
And then there is one more. Exactly.

357
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,680
Integration testing where we are testing

358
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,960
how the application works from

359
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,760
the backend and front end, how

360
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,840
these two parts of the application
communicating with each other.

361
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,680
Okay.

362
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:15,560
So these will be
the levels of the testing.

363
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:24,080
So now what about the types of the testing
guys? So,

364
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,560
so on set small regression tests.

365
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,240
Right.

366
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,560
So those are the subtypes.

367
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,040
What is the parent of those subtypes guys.

368
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,160
Can anyone guess

369
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,040
it's a functional test.

370
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,960
Absolutely right.

371
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,400
So types of testing.

372
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,240
So there's two two types of testing.

373
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,160
One is functional,
one is nonfunctional testing, right?

374
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,120
So functional testing and then

375
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,840
nonfunctional testing.

376
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,360
Okay.

377
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,520
So what do we know
about nonfunctional testing?

378
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,120
What can we do in
nonfunctional testing guys?

379
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,680
So in functional,
it's pretty clear, right?

380
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:17,040
So small test regression, everything
that you perform on the on the web page.

381
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,720
Right.

382
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,440
Okay. Speed. Right.

383
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,040
Non nonfunctional speed.

384
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,640
What what In other words,
can we say that guys

385
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,080
there is some terminology for this

386
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,320
performance testing.

387
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,440
Absolutely right.

388
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,640
There we go, performance testing.

389
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,520
And then there's there should be one more

390
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:45,600
nonfunctional test guys.

391
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,560
So memory tests.

392
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,080
Okay.

393
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:50,400
That that's that's
part of the performance testing

394
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,000
reliability.

395
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,320
Okay.

396
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,720
In other words, guys, that
that's really close.

397
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,320
Low testing is very similar
to performance testing.

398
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,400
Okay.

399
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:08,880
What about your, um, what about the

400
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,560
how do we call when you

401
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,200
when you have passwords, strong passwords,
not strong password.

402
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,760
There we go. It's security testing, right?

403
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:24,120
So you need to make sure your
the security of the application

404
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:29,480
is good as well right
before you launch your application life.

405
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,000
Okay.

406
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,080
Secure the testing.

407
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,840
Okay. All right.

408
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,600
So we went through the level of testing,
types of testing.

409
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,160
Right.

410
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:50,000
Any questions so far, guys?

411
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,440
Okay, good.

412
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,480
All right.

413
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,200
So now what we are going to do is now

414
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,520
we will actually start
going over the selenium itself.

415
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:07,640
Okay, So did anyone did a research
What about selenium?

416
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,200
What is selenium glass

417
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:17,160
do automate web browser actions.

418
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,440
Okay.

419
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,560
It's testing tool.

420
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:26,160
Okay.

421
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,800
So that we can automate our test cases.

422
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:35,280
Okay.

423
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,160
Any other guesses, guys?

424
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,080
It's a testing tool.

425
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:44,280
That is correct.

426
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,240
It's a library.

427
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,320
It's an open source automation tool.

428
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,680
Okay, that's very good.

429
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,280
Quick input.

430
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,640
Select navigate that everyone can use.

431
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,120
Yes, that is good.

432
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:01,320
Okay, so guys, selenium is a set of tools.

433
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,640
Okay,
so there are four different components

434
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,840
in selenium and we will be going over
those components one by one,

435
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:15,920
but we will be using only one component
from that Selenium.

436
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,560
Selenium set.

437
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,280
Okay.

438
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,600
So Selenium is,

439
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,560
is a set of tools.

440
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,160
Okay.

441
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,400
Which

442
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,480
helps us to

443
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,960
automate

444
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,400
lab applications.

445
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:44,640
It is mainly used, mainly used

446
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,520
to perform

447
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,560
functional testing.

448
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,320
Okay.

449
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:56,440
So selenium itself,
it has four different components.

450
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:56,760
Okay.

451
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,440
That's why it's a set of tools.

452
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,720
Okay? It's a set of testing tools

453
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,520
which
will help us to automate web application

454
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:09,160
and it is mainly used
for functional testing.

455
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:13,600
Okay, So now let's go over the selenium

456
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,280
components.

457
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,080
Okay.

458
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,600
So we sat
there are for anyone did research

459
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,600
about these components guys

460
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:45,720
okay ID what driver are see
and grid right.

461
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:50,520
So Selenium

462
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,240
ID right.

463
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,000
Selenium grid

464
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,840
Selenium lab driver and

465
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,600
Selenium bar see.

466
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,120
Right.

467
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,720
So there's four different components
Which one are we're going

468
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:14,040
to be using in our class cars.

469
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:14,840
Exactly.

470
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:20,680
We will be using selenium work driver
because this one is the most updated one.

471
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,360
Right.

472
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:26,160
So there are selenium I.D, grade and RC,
they are a little bit outdated.

473
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,920
I will go over them

474
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,400
like high level. Okay.

475
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,320
We're not going to be going into
details for the ID, RC and

476
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,200
GRID,

477
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,640
but mainly we will be

478
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,120
going over the selenium web driver.

479
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:44,760
Right.

480
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,920
So I.D. stands

481
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,880
for the Integrated

482
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,560
Integrated Development

483
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,080
Environment.

484
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,840
Right.

485
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,160
And then our grid is going to be

486
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:16,440
I think it was just the Firefox plug
in, if I'm not mistaken.

487
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:20,040
And then RC is just the

488
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,080
remote control.

489
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:25,560
Okay.

490
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,960
So I'll just put these high level
explanations on here, guys,

491
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,960
but we will be going a little bit

492
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:35,000
into details of what

493
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:39,160
the the other three
selenium components do.

494
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,120
Okay.

495
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:43,120
I'll show you
what's going on with those in a

496
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,720
in a chart and what is going on, how,

497
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,080
how they were developed
and everything like that.

498
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,680
But for now, let's focus on selenium.

499
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,200
What?

500
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:57,360
Driver Okay, so now what is

501
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,480
selenium

502
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,160
work?

503
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:14,560
Driver Guys, direct communication
with the browser.

504
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:26,200
Okay, So

505
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,600
some people said it's free, right?

506
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,920
So it's,
it's an open source automation tool

507
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:40,680
which allows us to perform actions
on a web application.

508
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,240
Right? Exactly.

509
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,680
It allows testing across various browsers.

510
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:46,960
Right.

511
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,920
It's an open source
and it's very popular right now.

512
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,240
So we can put in here that open source

513
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,520
automation tool, Right.

514
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,200
Which allows us

515
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,760
to perform

516
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,120
actions on a

517
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,760
web application.

518
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,440
Right.

519
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:16,520
And I'm pretty sure guys in Java,

520
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,240
you guys are already familiar
with interfaces, right?

521
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:28,360
I hope you are.

522
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:38,480
Did you guys go over the interfaces
in Java?

523
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,200
Not yet or yes.

524
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,640
Oh, you are talking about it.
Okay, that's fine.

525
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:49,160
So I could just put in here
that web driver.

526
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,200
Web driver is an interface, right?

527
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,240
So you will be seeing what I mean.

528
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:59,200
But after you guys
start going through the interfaces

529
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,800
and we will see what this interface
has in the future.

530
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,320
Okay. So right now
let's just put it in here.

531
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,640
That web driver is an interface.

532
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,080
Okay. All right.

533
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:15,640
So now before we dive into coding,
there is one more thing

534
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,280
that I want to go through.

535
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,880
In theory, its advantages

536
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,960
and disadvantages
of this selenium web driver.

537
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:31,000
Okay, So let's go here.

538
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,800
So then you

539
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,800
web driver

540
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:39,280
Okay, So what do you think guys,
are the advantages

541
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,000
of selenium web driver

542
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:43,600
Well,

543
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,920
first of all, it is free, right?

544
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,560
It's open source, right?
You don't have to pay for it.

545
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,560
You can just go ahead and download it
by itself.

546
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,240
Right?

547
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:01,200
So open source, what else, guys?

548
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,600
It's most popular. Okay.

549
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,480
And supports various programing languages.

550
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,760
Exactly.

551
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,760
So it works

552
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:17,800
with the different

553
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:22,880
languages.

554
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,280
Right. So what kind of languages do
we know, guys?

555
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:28,920
So one of them
that we will be working with is

556
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,440
Java, right?

557
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,640
So he also works with Ruby.

558
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,560
It also works with C-sharp

559
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:42,600
JavaScript, right?

560
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,600
So it works with different
and different languages.

561
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,440
I think it also worked with Python
it from that mistake.

562
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,760
What else guys

563
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,440
automate?

564
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,680
We can automate different browsers,
so that means it

565
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,800
supports multiple browsers, right?

566
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:06,240
That's one of the biggest advantages
of selenium web driver.

567
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:10,920
So we can see
we can put in here works with

568
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:15,320
multiple whole browsers and

569
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,640
supports

570
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,480
cross browser

571
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,720
testing.

572
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:33,000
Okay, anything else guys?

573
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,880
Is integration with ID?

574
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:41,520
Yes. Support.

575
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,840
Absolutely right.

576
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:48,600
So supports across various operating
systems, right.

577
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:53,960
So that means it is it doesn't care
what operating system you are using.

578
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:57,000
You can use selenium
in that operating system,

579
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,680
either its iOS or either
is Linux or Windows.

580
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,800
It doesn't really matter.

581
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,880
You can use Selenium in any case, right?

582
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,080
So we can put in here

583
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:12,360
that it is OS independent, right.

584
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,880
So you can use it in

585
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,320
BIOS, Linux

586
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,920
or Windows.

587
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,200
Okay.

588
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,520
So these are four really

589
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,840
main advantages of selenium web Driver.

590
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,440
Okay,
So now let's talk about disadvantages

591
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:48,960
of selenium web driver.

592
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:59,880
Any thoughts, guys, on this?

593
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,840
Open source means means no support.

594
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,640
That is correct.

595
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,840
And there is no technical support.

596
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:10,280
That is correct. So no

597
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,680
technical support, right?

598
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,080
Okay.

599
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,840
If you pay for it, that means that means

600
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,000
whenever you pay for it,
you can get anything is broken.

601
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:26,680
You can go ahead and call or email
their support team.

602
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,280
Right.

603
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,080
So since it's free,
there is no technical support for you.

604
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,280
Okay.

605
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,760
Anything else?

606
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,520
Exactly.

607
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,800
It only supports web based application.

608
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,680
That is correct.
That is very good point actually.

609
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,880
So that means this advantage for us is

610
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:50,800
we cannot automate the desktop
applications with selenium.

611
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:51,880
Right.

612
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,840
So cannot

613
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:58,160
automate desktop

614
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,840
applications.

615
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:04,840
Right.

616
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,360
Okay. Anything else guys.

617
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:11,120
So we can't automate,

618
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:15,040
not automate, let's not put automate,
let's put cannot test that.

619
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:20,560
So applications
with selenium, right, right.

620
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:22,720
Correct.

621
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,640
So there is no visibility on reporting.

622
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:27,480
Right.

623
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:32,400
So there is we can we can say no

624
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,920
the built in reports right.

625
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,880
In selenium web driver.

626
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,360
Okay. What else

627
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,760
new features might not always work.

628
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,880
What kind of features are we talking about

629
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:05,680
or we're talking about the selenium
features itself

630
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:12,400
or any web application features,
open source.

631
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,120
It can be developed by anyone.

632
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:17,080
Yeah, that is correct.

633
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:17,760
Depends.

634
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,880
Third party framework
like you can run test and G.

635
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:21,720
Okay.

636
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:27,240
There is one more thing that we cannot do
with selenium web driver.

637
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:32,760
Guys, is we cannot automate images
or test images.

638
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,160
We cannot test captures videos,

639
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,600
anything visual on the web page.

640
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:43,080
Okay, So you won't be able to verify

641
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:47,880
anything visually on the Web page.

642
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,640
Okay.

643
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,080
Is that clear?

644
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,360
Guys cannot

645
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:58,600
test captures.

646
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,400
I hope you guys know what capture
is, right?

647
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:07,760
Captures images, videos,

648
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,840
capture is when

649
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,440
when the website, when the web application

650
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,000
is trying to tell you that
are you robot or no.

651
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,320
Right.

652
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:22,680
It's asking for something for you to enter
any text or you need to choose

653
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:28,600
some or what's called some images
from that particular square.

654
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,080
Right?

655
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,640
There you go.

656
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,120
Yeah. So that is capture.

657
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:37,520
So that is we cannot test it

658
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,680
with selenium web driver
unless we do it manually.

659
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:48,200
Okay.

660
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:51,840
And there is one more thing that in here

661
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:55,680
we can put as a disadvantage,
but it's not really a disadvantage.

662
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:59,640
Maybe it is in, in some way

663
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:04,680
that it takes more time
for you to build the test cases

664
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:08,280
because you have to build the logic
in your code, right?

665
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,040
So to build to build
the test case is easy.

666
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,400
You just write the steps

667
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,000
you pasted in your Excel
or you pasted in your in your ticket.

668
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,600
Right.

669
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:22,360
But to finish that test case
inside, inside your code

670
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:27,000
or by using selenium web driver,
it's a bit challenging sometimes.

671
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:30,000
Okay. It takes

672
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,880
more time

673
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,400
to create

674
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,200
test cases.

675
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,840
Okay.

676
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,400
All right, guys,

677
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:51,000
any questions so far, guys, that

678
00:40:51,480 --> 00:41:00,560
what we have done from the beginning
right.

679
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,760
It's more manual work
to actually start automating?

680
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,760
Well, sometimes it depends on a test case.

681
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,440
Right.

682
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:12,480
So MIT to to actually build

683
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,280
or to actually write a test case,
it's easy, right?

684
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:22,200
But after you write the test case,
you need to implement all those steps.

685
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:22,480
Right?

686
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,800
You need to
you need to build that logic in your code.

687
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,200
So sometimes that might get challenging.

688
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:32,960
So those technical test cases are

689
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,840
are taking more time to actually complete

690
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:42,000
that whole process.

691
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,640
Well, we'll be coming to screenshots
at the at the actually last

692
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,960
classes of the Selenium

693
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,760
parallel testing.

694
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,840
No, we will be actually using
a different tool to do a parallel testing.

695
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:03,240
Okay.

696
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,160
No built in reports.

697
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:09,440
What I mean by no built in reports
is whenever you whenever you,

698
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:14,400
you execute your test and your test is
finished, let's say it's passed, right?

699
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:19,920
You don't have any reports on hand
so that you can show your manager

700
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,160
or your test lead
or anyone that your test case has passed.

701
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:23,880
Okay.

702
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:28,280
So that that's
what I meant by no built in reports.

703
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,680
Exactly. No feedback on results. Yes.

704
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,120
So you can just get that

705
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:38,720
your test passed in your console,
but you won't be able to have any

706
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:43,560
like estimate of report
or any kind of reports on hand.

707
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:49,200
Okay.

708
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:49,800
All right.

709
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,920
Any other questions, guys?

710
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,480
Do we use per facto?

711
00:42:53,480 --> 00:43:04,560
So I know I'm
not really sure what that is actually.

712
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:16,480
Any other questions, guys,
before we dive into coding?

713
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:26,680
All right.

714
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,400
Okay. If everything is good.

715
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:35,640
So let's go ahead and start the fun part,
okay?

716
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:38,760
So what I'm going to do, I'm

717
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,880
going to create a new package

718
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,280
in here

719
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,280
for class one.

720
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:56,760
Okay?

721
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:03,000
And then what I will do is
I will create a new job class, okay?

722
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,800
And I will name it as launch

723
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:10,280
browser, a

724
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,080
bigger for you

725
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,040
and what I'm going to do,
going to paste the main method in here.

726
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:20,400
Okay.

727
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,120
All right.

728
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,920
So I hope
everyone knows how to do this stuff right?

729
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,040
So this is pretty easy.

730
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,720
Creating a package and creating a class

731
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,680
for now, since it's our first class guys.

732
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:39,200
So we will be gone over new methods, over
new functionalities, and over new code.

733
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,000
So it would be better for
you guys to listen first

734
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:45,680
and then type in the code afterwards.

735
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:52,400
Okay.

736
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,040
All right.

737
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,560
So now, guys, so everyone has

738
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,360
the selenium project, right?

739
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,280
It doesn't really matter.

740
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,680
Yeah, I'll give you time, guys.

741
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:04,200
Okay.

742
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:09,920
It doesn't really matter what you call it,
right? It

743
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,600
is. Okay. Sounds good.

744
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:13,920
All right, guys.

745
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:18,080
So everyone has the Selenium
project set up.

746
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:21,320
You have drivers you have all
the libraries important, right?

747
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:25,280
So now we have our first class in here,
our main method.

748
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,200
So before we start

749
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,600
interacting with the browser
itself, right?

750
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:38,760
So inside our drivers, guys inside our
drivers will have two different drivers,

751
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:43,040
which is one of them is Gecko Driver,
one of them is Chrome Driver, Right.

752
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:47,680
So the chrome driver we know
is for the Chrome browser

753
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:51,240
Gecko driver is for the Firefox browser.

754
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:56,400
Okay, So what we will be doing,
we will be mostly working

755
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,160
with the Chrome driver, the

756
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,760
you don't have to have it right now,
but in the future

757
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:10,560
I think we might have some actions
with Firefox as well.

758
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,360
Okay.

759
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,760
If you don't have a gecko driver right
now, it is fine guys.

760
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:20,680
That's okay.

761
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,440
You have a

762
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,400
you have a question sign on drivers.

763
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:26,880
It's okay.

764
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,600
So seems like
you connected to the to the GitHub

765
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:38,640
but you didn't push your code yet
so that's why you have that sign. Yes.

766
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:42,200
I created a package
under source folder in here

767
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:45,200
and I created a class under the

768
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:48,360
that package as well.

769
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:51,080
Okay, guys,
if you have only chrome, that is fine.

770
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:53,240
We will be working with Chrome anyways.

771
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,960
Okay.

772
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:00,040
But if you don't have chrome, please
download Chrome.

773
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:01,840
Okay. All right.

774
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:05,880
So now, guys, so we have the drivers,
we have all the libraries in here.

775
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,000
So now before we interact

776
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,600
with our Chrome

777
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:17,720
or with our browser and we perform
any actions in there, what we need to do,

778
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:23,120
which is we need to set the properties
before we perform anything.

779
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,560
Okay, so how this is going to work?

780
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:26,880
It's pretty simple. English.

781
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,880
Okay, guys, so what I am going to do,
I will start typing in here.

782
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:35,640
System dot set property.

783
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:44,440
Okay, so let me actually do this.

784
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:47,160
So let's see that property.

785
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:52,280
Okay, so this is the first method
that I can see in here that popped up.

786
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,000
Okay.

787
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,800
So what you can see
in here, it's asking for us

788
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,920
for two different arguments.

789
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,520
Okay, So it accepts
two different arguments in here.

790
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,760
So both of them are as a string value.

791
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,560
Okay, so I'm going to choose this method.

792
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:14,440
So I have one string in here of comma,

793
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:18,680
the second string in here, and I'm going
to close my statement in here.

794
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:19,640
Right.

795
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:26,200
So for the first key, for the first value
that I need to enter in here,

796
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:31,600
I need to specify what driver
I am going to be using.

797
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:32,760
Okay?

798
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:36,840
In this case, I am going to be using
a chrome driver, right.

799
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,360
Which will interact with a Chrome browser.

800
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,240
So now the first the first value that I'm
going to enter, it's a built in value.

801
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:48,080
Okay. You just have to remember this.

802
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,640
Okay, so what I'm going

803
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:54,360
do in here,
I'll start typing web driver, dot,

804
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:56,800
chrome,

805
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,000
dot driver.

806
00:48:59,000 --> 00:48:59,680
Okay.

807
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,160
And again, guys, this is them.

808
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:06,120
This is the built in what's called feature

809
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:10,320
that you just need to remember to interact
with the Chrome browser.

810
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:11,200
Okay.

811
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:14,520
So the second one,

812
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:17,640
the second value
that I need to pass in here

813
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,840
is to tell my intelligent,

814
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:24,880
where is my chrome driver is located.

815
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:29,160
Okay, so in this case, if you look in here
we have a drivers folder

816
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,000
and that chrome driver is located

817
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,280
inside this drivers folder.

818
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:35,840
Right.

819
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:39,960
So what I'm going to do simply
right in here,

820
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:42,360
I'll put drivers slash

821
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:45,840
chrome driver.

822
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,120
Okay.

823
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:52,320
It is case sensitive. Yes.

824
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:58,200
So since I'm having Mac in here guys,
I don't need any extensions.

825
00:49:58,560 --> 00:49:59,440
Okay.

826
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:02,800
So I, I don't need any extensions in here.

827
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:06,880
But if you are using,
if you're using windows,

828
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:10,920
what you need to do is for windows,

829
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:13,840
you need to add an extension of that key.

830
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:14,520
Right.

831
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:20,720
And extension of that XY.

832
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:21,440
Right.

833
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:23,240
Okay.

834
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:27,120
So now here what we did on line six guys,

835
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:30,280
we told our intelligent that, okay,

836
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,880
so I'll be interacting with a Chrome
browser.

837
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:35,520
Yeah, with a Chrome browser and

838
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:40,640
this is my pass.

839
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,560
This is my path
for the contract Chrome driver

840
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:48,480
that I will be using right
where the ad is.

841
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:52,840
It's going to be here
just after your chrome driver dot xy.

842
00:50:53,880 --> 00:51:02,120
Okay.

843
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:02,960
All right.

844
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:04,760
Okay.

845
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:16,200
Any questions so far, guys?

846
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,600
I should be clear.

847
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:21,520
Right,
Because we didn't really perform anything

848
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:26,920
or if if that doesn't work for Windows
guys, you can also

849
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:30,360
you can also use

850
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,480
you can use the backslash.

851
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:34,280
Okay.

852
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:36,960
Sometimes it doesn't really work for

853
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,960
for for Windows users

854
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:44,480
so you can use back to
double backslash is so that it works

855
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,080
it not it's not always but

856
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:50,200
sometimes some might have that problem

857
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:54,120
for Mac.

858
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:56,080
Oh you mean the absolute path.

859
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:59,200
Okay yeah you can you can,

860
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,840
you can actually do
the absolute path in here.

861
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,520
But in this case I'm going to explain that
why this doesn't.

862
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:08,600
It's the why it's not necessary.

863
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:12,200
Because you are in this class, right?

864
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:15,360
You try to access the driver,

865
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,800
which is in that specific project.

866
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:22,360
Okay.

867
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:26,200
So your intelligent will figure it out.

868
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:32,160
What where your chrome driver
is because your intelligent

869
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:37,360
will be looking inside this Selenium
Basics batch ten project.

870
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:39,600
Okay.

871
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:45,080
That's why you don't have to put
an absolute path in here.

872
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:55,320
Drivers Chrome Driver.

873
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:57,960
Okay.

874
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:00,440
What if it's a different web
browser? Okay. Yeah.

875
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,240
Good questions.

876
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:03,480
Okay, so there are a couple of questions,
guys. I'm Greg.

877
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:06,240
I'm going to explain those one by one.

878
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:11,000
So first of all, this one,
this one, as I said, it's a built in

879
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:14,160
what's called

880
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:15,760
built in feature, right?

881
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,440
So this is unique, right?

882
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:21,480
So in order for you to interact
with a Chrome driver,

883
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:24,320
I mean, Chrome browser,
you have to write this one.

884
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,760
So this is always going to be unique.

885
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:29,400
This is the way it's
going to stay in here.

886
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:30,840
Okay.

887
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:33,320
The first argument that we passed in here.

888
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:39,040
Okay, So if you want to do something
else, then in here

889
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:42,960
what you can do Web driver

890
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,760
thing if you want to use the gecko driver,

891
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:47,400
it was Gecko dot driver.

892
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,200
Okay.

893
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:53,720
And since we're using Chrome,
then it's going to be chrome.

894
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,880
Okay, guys, depending on which

895
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,760
browser you want to interact with,

896
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,960
that's how you will be changing
the name in here in the middle.

897
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,360
Okay. Okay.

898
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:09,200
Coming to the second argument
that we passed in here.

899
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:11,560
Here you are.

900
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:14,040
Just specifying

901
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:19,400
here, you're just specifying the

902
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:24,480
the chrome driver where it is located.

903
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:25,320
Okay.

904
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:29,160
Because you need to tell you
tell me, Jay, where it's running from.

905
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:29,920
Okay.

906
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,520
So if you don't have your driver,

907
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:35,840
you won't be able to open up the Chrome
browser, Right?

908
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:41,440
So that Chrome driver will be helping us
to open the Chrome browser.

909
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:45,640
And we need to say in here,
we need to specify where

910
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:47,880
that Chrome driver is located.

911
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:49,600
Okay.

912
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:53,160
Or Yeah, you don't have to do that.

913
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:56,880
Yes, you don't have to do
you don't have to put that absolute path.

914
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:01,880
Okay.

915
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:05,560
But make sure, guys,
make sure you have a drivers

916
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:09,560
folder in your project
in side your project.

917
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:10,560
Okay.

918
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:14,040
And inside that folder
you have this chrome

919
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:17,080
driver.

920
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,000
Okay, guys.

921
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,640
So if your drivers, if your drivers

922
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:23,680
are in a different location,

923
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:29,080
then you have to put your absolute cap,
but you need to have this drivers

924
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:31,920
folder inside your project.

925
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:33,120
Okay?

926
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:36,400
If you don't have it, create
one folder in.

927
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,280
Copy that Chrome driver

928
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,960
from wherever it is and paste it in here.

929
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:48,480
Okay? And

930
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:55,680
where does the system come from?

931
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,080
System comes from Java.

932
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:58,920
Okay,

933
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,400
so it's a it's a final class, guys

934
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,600
said, okay, yeah, that's fine,
That's fine.

935
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,000
Guys, if you have that question

936
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,160
mark, it is fine
as long as you have those chrome drivers.

937
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:14,960
Chrome driver and gecko driver
inside your project, that is fine.

938
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,520
That's not a big deal.

939
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:35,400
That that question mark.

940
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,480
Okay. Any other questions, guys?

941
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:39,360
Is anyone confused?

942
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:46,080
What is going on?

943
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:48,840
Copying to intelligent?
Yeah, that is correct.

944
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:58,920
So you have to do it in the actual folder,
right.

945
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:20,280
Where you downloaded.

946
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:21,080
Okay.

947
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:22,680
All right, let's continue, you guys.

948
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:25,480
Okay.

949
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:30,200
So what I will be doing next since

950
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,160
this one.

951
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:36,800
It's fine.

952
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:42,200
It's okay.

953
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:42,920
All right.

954
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:46,680
So the next thing that I will be doing
right now

955
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:49,760
so I mentioned here,
I told my intelligent, Hey, I'm

956
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:53,360
using the chrome driver
and here is the chrome driver,

957
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:56,240
the path where it is located.

958
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:59,480
So I will be using exactly this file

959
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:02,280
to to interact with my Chrome browser.

960
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:03,120
Okay.

961
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:06,600
So now the next line, what I will do,

962
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,040
I will need to launch my browser.

963
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:14,280
Okay, So what I will do in here,

964
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:17,400
I will simply start with saying

965
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:19,840
web driver driver

966
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:24,120
is equal to new chrome driver.

967
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:28,600
Okay, since we are interacting

968
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:34,560
with the Chrome browser,
we will be instantiating a new instance.

969
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:38,120
Right? And use of our chrome driver.

970
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:43,560
If it was for if we were using
if we were using the Firefox,

971
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:47,440
I think it should be
Firefox driver in here.

972
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:51,240
But since we're using the chrome driver,
we will be simply using

973
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:54,520
chrome driver in here.

974
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:55,320
Okay.

975
00:58:55,800 --> 00:59:01,960
Any on this guys?

976
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:09,560
Any questions on like ten or 14?

977
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:11,000
Okay, cool.

978
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,400
So now what I will do in here,
I'm going to right click

979
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:17,640
and I will run this class.

980
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:18,840
Okay.

981
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:25,920
So when I run this class, let's see
what's going to happen.

982
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:26,760
There we go.

983
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:27,880
What happened, guys?

984
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:32,280
So right now, what we can see in here
that it launched

985
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:35,880
the Chrome browser in here, right?

986
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,320
So it didn't go

987
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:42,640
it didn't go to any to any website.

988
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:55,200
Why? Why?

989
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,280
It's all right.

990
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:59,120
Because probably you don't have the

991
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:08,040
I don't think
you have the libraries in here.

992
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:10,840
Yeah,
I don't think you have the important.

993
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:15,240
That's why you don't have this.

994
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:17,840
So it didn't go to any website. Why?

995
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:20,920
Because we didn't specify anything.

996
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:21,960
Right.

997
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:24,720
What is specify
where to go, where to navigate.

998
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:25,080
Right.

999
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:28,320
We didn't specify what website
we want to navigate.

1000
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:29,600
Right.

1001
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:30,960
Exactly.

1002
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,120
We don't have the euro yet.

1003
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:35,640
So what we just did, we just launched

1004
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:38,400
our Chrome browser.

1005
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:41,120
Look to this line 14.

1006
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:42,400
What is it going to do?

1007
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:45,880
It's going to launch the Chrome browser

1008
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:49,520
or Firefox browser,
whichever you put it in here.

1009
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:57,040
Okay, Any questions, guys in here?

1010
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:59,200
Is there anything you guys are confused?

1011
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:00,400
Shouldn't be right.

1012
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:03,000
It's pretty
easy and straightforward right now.

1013
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,800
Okay, so now it's time for us

1014
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:09,680
to go ahead and navigate to

1015
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:12,760
let's see if you

1016
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:15,520
are having some issues in here. So

1017
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:46,840
and then you see,

1018
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:50,280
okay, Nick, you missed that.

1019
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:52,400
Easy in there

1020
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:54,680
in your path.

1021
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:56,960
So make sure you put in here

1022
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:00,240
at the end.

1023
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:17,560
So that's why I don't think it's working.

1024
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:22,440
Uh, let's see.

1025
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:22,680
Yeah.

1026
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:26,280
Guys, check if you if you're using Mac,

1027
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:30,840
you don't need that easy
if you're using windows

1028
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:35,040
only if you're using windows,
you need an extension of the.

1029
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:37,040
Okay, guys.

1030
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:41,400
And make sure if your folder,
if your folder name starts

1031
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:44,200
with with a capital D,

1032
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,840
then you have to mention it here as well.

1033
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:49,640
Okay.

1034
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,920
So it's all case sensitive.

1035
01:02:51,960 --> 01:03:17,680
So so please pay attention to that.

1036
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:21,400
Okay guys here.

1037
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:22,880
Yeah, you don't have to.

1038
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:26,200
Okay, So you don't have that. Just put

1039
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:28,560
don't do that.

1040
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:31,080
Double double backslash is just do

1041
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,600
what's called the regular slash.

1042
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:36,680
Okay.

1043
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:39,600
So it seems like you have double backslash
as in Mac.

1044
01:03:39,920 --> 01:04:09,520
So try to do just one slash
and it should work in your case.

1045
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:13,320
Okay guys, after you have there's one
more thing guys.

1046
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:14,400
After you

1047
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:19,200
what's called after you have pasted

1048
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:22,800
your drivers, you might get some

1049
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:26,280
some notification when you run

1050
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:29,040
your code, it's not possible to run.

1051
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:30,440
Okay.

1052
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:33,000
Because there's some warning
that it's not safe.

1053
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,040
It's malicious and all that stuff. Right.

1054
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:41,480
So what you want to do in that case,
you want to go to your system preferences.

1055
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:45,880
Okay, System preferences

1056
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:53,880
and just go to security and privacy.

1057
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:56,920
And there should be here to allow anyway.

1058
01:04:57,240 --> 01:05:00,720
Okay, just click on that
and then urania code again,

1059
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:10,200
that should work.

1060
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:13,280
How to launch right click in here and run

1061
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:17,320
right.

1062
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:19,800
Okay guys, anyone else having issues?

1063
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:30,120
I'll explain line 14 as well.

1064
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:30,480
Okay.

1065
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:33,000
If you're having issues, please post it.

1066
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,640
Incentive support, guys.

1067
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,960
We will be taking taking a look at those.

1068
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:40,360
Okay.

1069
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:44,880
All right.

1070
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,040
Yeah. The messages in the console is fine.

1071
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:48,480
Yeah, that's fine, guys.

1072
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:51,600
As long as you have that Chrome
browser open,

1073
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:55,320
that's fine.

1074
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:59,640
All right,
So now let me explain in line 14 again

1075
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:05,200
and then we will continue.

1076
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:05,600
Okay.

1077
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:09,120
Line 14, guys,
what we are doing in here I am

1078
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:13,000
I am creating a new instance

1079
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:17,440
of the Chrome browser again by using.

1080
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:20,320
So basically what this line does,

1081
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:23,960
it's going to read everything in here.

1082
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,960
Okay, so we're using Chrome in here

1083
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:30,080
and this chrome driver is under drivers.

1084
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:35,280
So now what I'm to do,
I'm going to launch a new instance

1085
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:38,320
of the Chrome browser.

1086
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:41,280
So on line 14, what we're doing in here,

1087
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:49,720
we are launching the browser.

1088
01:06:49,720 --> 01:07:12,480
Any questions, guys?

1089
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:16,080
What preferences are we talking about?

1090
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:48,840
So I can show the preferences? Yes.

1091
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:53,080
If you if you have it with capital
starting with capital center,

1092
01:07:53,120 --> 01:08:05,040
then yes,
you have to mention the capital as well.

1093
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:08,160
Oh, system preferences.

1094
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,920
Okay, So system preferences in here

1095
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:18,000
you go to system preferences,
you go to security and privacy,

1096
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,320
and then there should be a button in here
to allow it anyway.

1097
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:24,520
Okay, So click on that and then run.

1098
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:25,680
Run your

1099
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:29,720
what's called running a code again.

1100
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:35,520
And that to work.

1101
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:36,960
Yes, that's fine. That's fine.

1102
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:38,040
The usual first day.

1103
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:43,800
Yeah, that's okay.

1104
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:46,280
I opened up empty page. That's fine.
That's okay.

1105
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:49,520
So you said that if you have
if you have the

1106
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:56,720
the Chrome browser open, that's fine.

1107
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:58,480
Okay, guys, let's move on. Right.

1108
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:01,960
So we opened up the we opened up

1109
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:06,000
the chrome browser and now what

1110
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,440
we need to do,
we need to navigate to, to some web page.

1111
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:10,560
Okay?

1112
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:13,280
So now it's pretty straightforward
and is easy.

1113
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:18,240
Okay, so what I will do in here.

1114
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:23,200
So now from now on,
I will be using that object

1115
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:26,640
from the line 14.

1116
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:27,560
Okay.

1117
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:32,480
So what I will do in here
in order for me to navigate to some page

1118
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:36,000
what I'm going to be
doing, I will be using this

1119
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:39,600
object that I created and what I will do

1120
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:44,800
when I hit Dot, it's going to give me
a lot of different methods

1121
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:49,280
that the first method
in order to navigate to the page

1122
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:52,240
is going to be driver dot get,

1123
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:55,720
which accepts one string argument.

1124
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:56,800
Okay,

1125
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:59,480
so what I will do in here

1126
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:02,520
inside the driver not get so

1127
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:06,480
I am going to be doing here let's

1128
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:13,400
let's see.

1129
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:17,520
Okay let me take this here.

1130
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:20,520
So let's say we're going to Google, right?

1131
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:22,920
So this is the thing.

1132
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:25,680
So what I am going to do

1133
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:28,520
or what you just go,
Yeah, let's do Google right now.

1134
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:32,120
So just copy and paste it in here.

1135
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:33,560
Okay?

1136
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:39,120
So driver dot get so get method
what it's going to do, it will go ahead

1137
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:45,600
and navigate to the website that you just
mentioned inside the parentheses.

1138
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:46,400
Okay.

1139
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:49,360
So what I'm going to do
going to right click

1140
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:52,560
and write my code right now and let's see

1141
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:56,840
what's going to happen.

1142
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:57,320
Okay?

1143
01:10:57,320 --> 01:11:01,640
Running now.

1144
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:02,920
Okay, There you go.

1145
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:08,360
So now what happened,
guys, is I am on Google page, right?

1146
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:12,440
So hopefully everyone had the same outcome

1147
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:15,440
that you guys landed on Google page,

1148
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:16,920
right?

1149
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:18,520
So pretty cool, right, guys?

1150
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:21,920
So starting off launching the browser,
navigating the website.

1151
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:30,440
So pretty good, right?

1152
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:33,680
Yes. It's really it's

1153
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:37,400
it's suggested

1154
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:41,400
the best way to do it,
you have to have the whole weblink. Yes.

1155
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:44,760
With the SGP and everything.

1156
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:47,400
It's highly recommended to have that look

1157
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,280
if you just do it.

1158
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:55,080
Yeah. W ww google.com it should work.

1159
01:11:55,080 --> 01:12:00,080
But if you just, if you do this
I don't think it's going to work.

1160
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:03,760
So if you just do this one,
I don't think it's going to work,

1161
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:06,000
but I'm not sure it might work.

1162
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,040
But let me run this again and see.

1163
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:13,960
But it's highly recommended, guys,
that you put the whole web link.

1164
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:15,760
Okay, So see you guys.

1165
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:20,640
It didn't navigate to Google because
we don't have the whole thing in here.

1166
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:21,800
Okay.

1167
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:27,480
So you
can see you can even see in the here

1168
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,760
that there are
there is some invalid argument exception.

1169
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:32,680
Okay.

1170
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:36,240
And we will be going over these exceptions
in the future classes.

1171
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:51,320
Okay.

1172
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:52,280
Work on.

1173
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:56,160
Did you do you have,
do you have the Chrome

1174
01:12:56,160 --> 01:13:19,560
browser open or no.

1175
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:38,040
Okay, then it's fine.

1176
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:43,280
If you can't import anything,
please posted in syntax support

1177
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:49,400
or go ahead and please watch the videos
from YouTube that we have.

1178
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:53,240
That should be that should be pretty easy
and straightforward.

1179
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:54,600
Guys. Okay,

1180
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:58,200
so for now

1181
01:13:58,200 --> 01:13:59,600
it's 820.

1182
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:01,840
So let's take a quick break, guys. Okay.

1183
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:05,840
So people who are a little tried
to find out

1184
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:11,680
and import everything, get ready
for the second part of the class.

1185
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:17,600
Okay.

1186
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:19,560
All right. Let's take a 15 minute break,

1187
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:21,760
okay.

1188
01:14:21,760 --> 01:31:09,520
And then we will continue with that.

1189
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:15,040
All right, guys, let's continue.

1190
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:36,240
Uh, let's see.

1191
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:38,280
All right, let's continue, guys.

1192
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:42,480
I see there are some people having issues,
but I think

1193
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:45,840
Please join the What's

1194
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:51,840
Mohammed's zoom,
and he's going to help you guys.

1195
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:56,880
He sent this he sent a Zoom link in
and the syntax support.

1196
01:31:56,880 --> 01:32:01,320
So please go ahead and do that.

1197
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:04,120
Okay.
But I hope the majority of the people.

1198
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:04,600
Right.

1199
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:07,760
A majority of the people,
they everyone have

1200
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:13,760
everyone has the oh,
let's call the jar files.

1201
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:15,920
Everyone figured out
what's going on, right?

1202
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:19,920
Everyone was able to launch the browser
and navigate to Google

1203
01:32:20,640 --> 01:32:26,720
right.

1204
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:29,160
The video you download at six. Okay.

1205
01:32:29,160 --> 01:32:31,320
I think six is going to work,
but I don't know.

1206
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:33,560
I have seven. That's fine.

1207
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:37,120
If if you if it's working with six jars,
that's fine, guys.

1208
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:43,560
Okay.

1209
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:44,160
All right.

1210
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:49,520
Okay. So

1211
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:56,840
okay, so we navigate into Google
pretty good, right?

1212
01:32:56,840 --> 01:32:59,520
So now there are a couple more thing.

1213
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:03,000
That's a couple more things
that we're going to be learning today.

1214
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:06,600
So there are a couple more methods

1215
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:09,960
that we will be learning from Selenium.

1216
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:11,440
So one of them, right?

1217
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:15,680
So when you navigate it to the euro, okay,

1218
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:19,800
when you navigate it to the URL,
you want to, sometimes

1219
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:23,960
you will navigate
to the to the right page.

1220
01:33:23,960 --> 01:33:27,720
But the URL itself, it's
not going to be the same.

1221
01:33:28,120 --> 01:33:28,680
Okay?

1222
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:31,480
So it might be different
sometimes that that might cause

1223
01:33:31,480 --> 01:33:33,480
any defects and everything.

1224
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:35,800
So what we can do actually

1225
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:41,480
with help of selenium work,
Selenium libraries, what we can do,

1226
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:47,280
we can capture that your
that we just navigated to.

1227
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:50,160
Okay so what I can do in here

1228
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:53,840
is can do driver that

1229
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:57,760
get current your row.

1230
01:33:58,280 --> 01:34:01,400
Okay so I have this method
it's built in methods

1231
01:34:01,400 --> 01:34:05,240
in selenium
so I can use this method, right?

1232
01:34:05,400 --> 01:34:10,240
So if I get the cure you guys,
what am I getting in return?

1233
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:12,600
What do you guys think

1234
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:22,520
I am getting the whole,

1235
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:28,320
the whole link that is in here, Right?

1236
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:30,400
So The one I navigated.

1237
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:32,120
I should be getting that.

1238
01:34:32,120 --> 01:34:37,080
But in that code, guys, what is the type
of the data I'm getting in return?

1239
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:43,440
Guys?

1240
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:44,440
There we go.

1241
01:34:44,440 --> 01:34:46,480
It is a string, right?

1242
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:49,200
So what, what I can do in here,

1243
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:53,680
I can simply assign this to this string,
right?

1244
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:57,240
I can say string URL is equal to driver.

1245
01:34:57,400 --> 01:34:59,920
Get here in Europe. Right.

1246
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:02,520
So I want to see this in my console.

1247
01:35:02,680 --> 01:35:04,720
So what I will do simply

1248
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:09,120
and here
I will print it out in my console.

1249
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:15,240
Okay, So what I'm going to do
is I'm going to run this code again

1250
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:22,280
and let's see what's going to happen.

1251
01:35:22,280 --> 01:35:22,960
There we go.

1252
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:25,000
So we opened it here, Google.

1253
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:27,560
So let me go back in here.

1254
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:30,280
So as you can see,

1255
01:35:30,280 --> 01:35:33,720
it printed out the right
your route for me.

1256
01:35:34,120 --> 01:35:35,880
Okay, So this is pretty easy.

1257
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:37,200
This is straightforward.

1258
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:40,280
Any questions on this, guys?

1259
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:43,560
So you get the URL,
you you can print it out

1260
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:45,400
or sometimes you need to verify

1261
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:49,320
that the zero is correct
right after you navigate it to the page.

1262
01:35:49,320 --> 01:35:50,080
Okay.

1263
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:51,480
All right.

1264
01:35:51,480 --> 01:35:56,720
So the other thing that we can do
after we get the new URL,

1265
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:59,840
we can get the title of the page.

1266
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:00,920
Okay.

1267
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:05,440
So if I get the title of the page, where
do I see the title of the page in here?

1268
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:07,800
Guys?

1269
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:09,840
So let's say I navigate it to the Google.

1270
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:12,400
This is my this is my.

1271
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:14,000
You are right.

1272
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,760
What is my title?

1273
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:22,320
My title is going to be on that tab,
right?

1274
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:26,320
So Google should be my title, right?

1275
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:32,160
So what I can do in here again,
guys, I can do Driver dot

1276
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:35,640
simply get title.

1277
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:38,360
Okay, so get title.

1278
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:41,920
It's going to return me
as string value as well.

1279
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:44,120
So I'm just going to assign this

1280
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:47,680
to a string in here.

1281
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:52,320
And what I will do,
I'll just print this out.

1282
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:56,960
Okay, So let's run this and see

1283
01:36:57,440 --> 01:37:00,000
if we can have this in our console,

1284
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:08,080
okay, there we go.

1285
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:09,800
So we navigate it to Google.

1286
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:14,040
So if you look in our console,
there's one link that we have

1287
01:37:14,040 --> 01:37:18,240
and there is
the second one is the title of the page.

1288
01:37:19,320 --> 01:37:19,880
Right?

1289
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:22,920
Pretty cool, right?

1290
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:27,640
So we got the URL that we entered
and we got the title

1291
01:37:27,640 --> 01:37:31,200
from that tab that we have right?

1292
01:37:31,200 --> 01:37:35,640
And at the very end, guys,
whenever we did some actions,

1293
01:37:35,640 --> 01:37:39,760
we performed some actions, we got the URL,
we got the title right.

1294
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:42,960
So what do we want to do
at the very end of our test

1295
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:48,560
guys,

1296
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:52,800
we need to close the browser
or to quit the session, right?

1297
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:57,720
So simply what I will do driver that quit.

1298
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:02,760
Okay, so when I run this code right
now, it's going to be really fast.

1299
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:05,360
Okay,
so you might not see it in my browser

1300
01:38:05,680 --> 01:38:08,760
but you will see it in your screens, guys.

1301
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:11,120
Okay, so this is going to be really fast.

1302
01:38:11,120 --> 01:38:13,640
So I'm not sure if you guys

1303
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,840
will be able to see this
You should be able to see this.

1304
01:38:17,080 --> 01:38:18,320
Yeah. Okay.

1305
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:19,080
We navigate it.

1306
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:19,680
There we go.

1307
01:38:19,680 --> 01:38:25,080
Google
and it terminated that session right away.

1308
01:38:25,080 --> 01:38:25,400
Right.

1309
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:30,360
So your code, whenever you write the code,
the selenium code is very fast, right?

1310
01:38:30,680 --> 01:38:33,120
So it's not going to be
waiting for anything.

1311
01:38:33,480 --> 01:38:36,480
So you navigate, it,
you got everything you need.

1312
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:39,120
You quit the browser. Okay. There we go.

1313
01:38:39,720 --> 01:38:40,280
Okay.

1314
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:41,160
Very good.

1315
01:38:41,160 --> 01:38:44,920
Right?

1316
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:47,400
Yeah.
We will be going over the waits, guys.

1317
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:52,360
We will be going over how to pause
anything, how to see anything.

1318
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:55,680
I will be showing you
how to pause the execution

1319
01:38:55,680 --> 01:39:00,160
so that we can see everything visually,
because everything is really fast.

1320
01:39:00,160 --> 01:39:00,560
Okay,

1321
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:05,080
So we can set a time

1322
01:39:05,080 --> 01:39:08,880
for quite a little bit later
in my next example.

1323
01:39:09,080 --> 01:39:15,080
Okay, guys.

1324
01:39:15,080 --> 01:39:19,280
So it is.

1325
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:21,680
Yeah, this was just the simple

1326
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:26,120
launching the browser,
navigating to one website,

1327
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:29,520
getting the euro, getting the title
and quitting the browser.

1328
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:33,440
Okay, so right now
we're not verifying anything, okay?

1329
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:36,200
Because we are just starting.

1330
01:39:36,200 --> 01:39:39,880
Okay, So but we will be

1331
01:39:40,760 --> 01:39:43,800
we will be verifying some information
on the web page.

1332
01:39:44,040 --> 01:39:47,240
Okay. In the future, classes. Okay.

1333
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:49,440
Right now, step by step class.

1334
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:53,400
Okay.

1335
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:54,000
All right.

1336
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:55,560
So let me see.

1337
01:39:55,560 --> 01:39:59,040
Let me close these sessions

1338
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:06,080
so quick.

1339
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:06,920
Okay.

1340
01:40:06,920 --> 01:40:26,160
Any questions before we move forward,
guys?

1341
01:40:26,160 --> 01:40:28,200
Oh, right.

1342
01:40:28,200 --> 01:40:29,400
Pretty good.

1343
01:40:30,760 --> 01:40:33,920
Okay, so let me actually

1344
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:39,240
do this.

1345
01:40:39,240 --> 01:40:41,640
It looks fun for right now.

1346
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:43,400
Hopefully it's going to remain the same.

1347
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:44,440
Well, we'll see. We'll see.

1348
01:40:44,440 --> 01:40:50,160
There will be some challenges, guys,
but they're not to too difficult for us.

1349
01:40:50,160 --> 01:41:09,840
Okay, Hamzah,
I need to see a project Explorer

1350
01:41:11,720 --> 01:41:13,920
right here that you

1351
01:41:14,680 --> 01:41:17,240
that you minimize need to see that

1352
01:41:23,480 --> 01:41:25,560
I need to see where that coming from.

1353
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:27,880
Okay.

1354
01:41:27,880 --> 01:41:30,880
But for now,
let me give you a quick task, guys.

1355
01:41:30,920 --> 01:41:33,240
Okay. Uh,

1356
01:41:35,720 --> 01:41:39,720
see, let me give you a quick test
so that you guys can practice.

1357
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:42,560
So let me actually

1358
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:48,600
create a new class in here.

1359
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:56,120
And to test one.

1360
01:41:56,120 --> 01:41:57,000
Okay, There we go.

1361
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:02,040
So launch the browser, guys,
navigate to Amazon, print out the title

1362
01:42:02,040 --> 01:42:05,560
and the URL in the console
and close the browser

1363
01:42:05,960 --> 01:42:11,280
right?

1364
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:13,600
So 5 minutes for this.

1365
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:14,560
It should be really easy,

1366
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:19,720
but try not to copy the
the properties how to set everything.

1367
01:42:19,720 --> 01:42:20,280
Okay.

1368
01:42:20,280 --> 01:42:23,240
Try to type in manually yourself.

1369
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:24,760
Okay guys.

1370
01:42:24,760 --> 01:42:42,400
So that way you practice with that.

1371
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:42,920
Okay.

1372
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:46,080
So you can delete
that classic delete that.

1373
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:49,680
Yes. You need a new class.

1374
01:42:49,680 --> 01:42:51,240
Open up a new class, guys.

1375
01:42:51,240 --> 01:42:54,400
Create a new class and complete this

1376
01:42:56,560 --> 01:43:00,080
and then we'll complete this together
real quick.

1377
01:43:00,120 --> 01:43:00,760
Okay?

1378
01:43:00,760 --> 01:43:04,320
And then we will be moving forward
to a different different

1379
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:07,240
actions on the web page.

1380
01:43:07,240 --> 01:44:06,520
Okay.

1381
01:44:06,520 --> 01:44:08,040
I'm sorry.

1382
01:44:08,040 --> 01:44:15,080
Your your driver folder is empty,
so that's why your code is not working.

1383
01:44:15,720 --> 01:44:20,240
Seems like you imported everything,
which is good, but you need to copy

1384
01:44:20,240 --> 01:44:23,280
and paste that drivers inside your drivers

1385
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:24,120
folder

1386
01:44:37,200 --> 01:44:41,040
like you can send a screenshot here

1387
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:47,160
or join the zoom link that Mohammed sent.

1388
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:50,640
Seems like he sent like four zoom links
and no one is

1389
01:44:50,640 --> 01:44:59,400
joining.

1390
01:44:59,400 --> 01:45:01,800
Nice. Okay. Some people are done already.

1391
01:45:01,800 --> 01:45:09,840
That's good.

1392
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:12,640
I hope you guys didn't copy and paste
everything they said.

1393
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:47,360
Properties,
please scroll up in your memory.

1394
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:48,960
Scroll up.

1395
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:51,520
I need to see the
whole error in your console.

1396
01:45:52,680 --> 01:45:56,440
There is some list that you need to check

1397
01:45:56,440 --> 01:45:58,640
that I need to check at the very top

1398
01:46:04,720 --> 01:46:05,360
clause

1399
01:46:06,040 --> 01:46:08,440
and quit. They don't do the same thing.

1400
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:11,280
I will go over those
at the end of the class.

1401
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:11,640
Okay.

1402
01:46:11,640 --> 01:46:23,880
So we'll be going over the difference
between those.

1403
01:46:23,880 --> 01:46:26,160
Yeah, that's fine. Clause quit.

1404
01:46:26,160 --> 01:46:28,080
It's going to close

1405
01:46:34,760 --> 01:46:44,320
and I need to see the whole error.

1406
01:46:44,320 --> 01:46:46,720
You didn't set the properties.

1407
01:46:46,720 --> 01:46:51,440
You your instance, a new chrome driver,
but you didn't set the properties.

1408
01:46:51,440 --> 01:47:18,080
That's why it's not running for you.

1409
01:47:18,080 --> 01:47:19,160
Okay, good.

1410
01:47:19,160 --> 01:47:21,640
All right, so let's do this together,

1411
01:47:21,640 --> 01:47:24,600
okay, Quickly

1412
01:47:26,280 --> 01:47:27,000
in here.

1413
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,520
Okay, So main method in here.
What do we need to do?

1414
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:34,520
First class for this task?

1415
01:47:34,520 --> 01:47:37,360
We need to set the properties. Right.

1416
01:47:37,680 --> 01:47:42,720
So I'm going to start with system
dot set property.

1417
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:44,640
So this is expecting me

1418
01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:49,320
to input two keys in here, right?

1419
01:47:49,720 --> 01:47:53,640
So one of them is telling that, hey, which

1420
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:56,920
which driver I'm going to be using, right?

1421
01:47:57,640 --> 01:48:00,160
So here

1422
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:06,120
work driver, chrome driver.

1423
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:10,000
And the second key in here is the path

1424
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:13,120
that we have the chrome drivers stored in.

1425
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:14,360
Right?

1426
01:48:14,360 --> 01:48:16,520
It's going to be

1427
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:18,960
drivers

1428
01:48:21,040 --> 01:48:22,680
Chrome driver.

1429
01:48:22,680 --> 01:48:25,200
Right. So we set the property.

1430
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:31,000
So now it's time for us to have
a new instance of the chrome driver.

1431
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:34,440
So what I will do in here, web driver.

1432
01:48:35,080 --> 01:48:36,480
Driver

1433
01:48:36,840 --> 01:48:40,680
is equal to new chrome driver.

1434
01:48:40,680 --> 01:48:41,520
Right?

1435
01:48:42,920 --> 01:48:46,720
So if I run this right
now, will this launch the browser

1436
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:56,880
or now guys, it's
not going to launch the browser.

1437
01:48:57,640 --> 01:49:01,120
Is there anyone who says Yes,

1438
01:49:01,280 --> 01:49:02,720
Yes, it will. Right.

1439
01:49:02,720 --> 01:49:05,240
Because let's take a look
at the previous example.

1440
01:49:05,240 --> 01:49:07,520
I left a note in here, guys.

1441
01:49:07,520 --> 01:49:12,280
Our line 14 will launch the browser.

1442
01:49:13,440 --> 01:49:14,160
Okay,

1443
01:49:14,160 --> 01:49:17,160
so please pay attention to these details.

1444
01:49:17,160 --> 01:49:17,840
Okay.

1445
01:49:17,960 --> 01:49:22,400
So line 16 that I have

1446
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:26,320
right now
in here will will launch the browser.

1447
01:49:26,640 --> 01:49:29,120
Okay,
So now after it launched the browser,

1448
01:49:29,120 --> 01:49:33,480
we need to tell our browser
where to navigate the.

1449
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:37,880
Okay, so what I will do is driver get.

1450
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:42,360
And here I think

1451
01:49:42,840 --> 01:49:45,840
is Amazon dot com.

1452
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:48,080
Right.

1453
01:49:48,720 --> 01:49:51,760
And then what I need to do in here
I need to get

1454
01:49:52,200 --> 01:49:56,880
the would navigate it to the Amazon
right now I need to get the title

1455
01:49:57,080 --> 01:50:02,520
and I need to get the zero right
so both of them we can

1456
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:06,480
we can store them in a string right
so title

1457
01:50:07,560 --> 01:50:11,720
is equal to driver the get title

1458
01:50:12,920 --> 01:50:15,800
and then the second one is zero.

1459
01:50:17,120 --> 01:50:18,480
Go to the driver

1460
01:50:21,040 --> 01:50:23,040
that get

1461
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:30,360
a new URL.

1462
01:50:30,360 --> 01:50:30,560
Right?

1463
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:34,760
And then we can simply print this out

1464
01:50:36,640 --> 01:50:39,640
title and concatenate here

1465
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:43,200
the URL.

1466
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:46,920
And at the very end
what we need to do is just

1467
01:50:48,720 --> 01:50:50,760
quit the browser

1468
01:50:50,760 --> 01:50:56,240
right?

1469
01:50:56,240 --> 01:50:57,080
All right.

1470
01:50:57,120 --> 01:50:59,320
To always stored this information.

1471
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:02,040
If we just put it.

1472
01:51:02,040 --> 01:51:02,800
Oh, that's fine.

1473
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:03,600
That's fine, guys.

1474
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:07,920
I mean, if your best bet is to store it

1475
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:11,400
inside the string or whatever
the return is,

1476
01:51:11,880 --> 01:51:16,960
but you can, you can simply store
this inside the the print line as well.

1477
01:51:17,600 --> 01:51:21,720
All right.

1478
01:51:21,720 --> 01:51:23,360
It's title something.

1479
01:51:23,360 --> 01:51:23,640
Yeah.

1480
01:51:23,640 --> 01:51:26,120
It's just the it's
just a naming convention, right?

1481
01:51:26,160 --> 01:51:26,880
You can name it.

1482
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:27,960
Whatever you want to name it.

1483
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:31,800
Right. So

1484
01:51:33,600 --> 01:51:34,640
the best practice

1485
01:51:34,640 --> 01:51:39,000
is to store them in a string
and then print them out or however.

1486
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:43,120
I mean, if you want to verify those at the
and in the future,

1487
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:47,520
then you need to store them inside
the inside the string.

1488
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:49,880
So that's that's the best practice.

1489
01:51:49,880 --> 01:51:52,320
Okay. So now let's run.

1490
01:51:52,320 --> 01:52:04,200
Okay, Let's run
this and see what's going on.

1491
01:52:04,200 --> 01:52:04,640
Okay.

1492
01:52:04,640 --> 01:52:11,520
Amazon, there we go.

1493
01:52:11,720 --> 01:52:16,000
So now it it closed the browser, right?

1494
01:52:16,040 --> 01:52:18,360
And now we have the

1495
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:22,640
the title and the title right here

1496
01:52:23,960 --> 01:52:28,680
and the euro right here.

1497
01:52:28,680 --> 01:52:32,840
Okay.

1498
01:52:32,840 --> 01:52:34,120
All right.

1499
01:52:34,120 --> 01:52:41,880
Let's see.

1500
01:52:41,880 --> 01:52:49,280
I need to see the error, guys.

1501
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:51,960
What's the same? But not working?

1502
01:52:51,960 --> 01:52:53,840
Yeah, I need to see the whole error, guys.

1503
01:52:53,840 --> 01:53:08,160
Okay, so.

1504
01:53:08,160 --> 01:53:09,000
Okay,

1505
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:15,560
so you have to
you need to follow the steps

1506
01:53:15,560 --> 01:53:18,040
that Amazon sent
in the course announcements.

1507
01:53:18,920 --> 01:53:20,520
But think

1508
01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:25,840
let me see if you did

1509
01:53:28,280 --> 01:53:36,720
go here. Yes.

1510
01:53:36,720 --> 01:53:41,040
So basically, as I explained before,
guys, you need to go to your system

1511
01:53:41,040 --> 01:54:09,840
preferences.

1512
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:12,600
Chrome driver cannot be opened.
Okay, that's fine. Yeah.

1513
01:54:12,600 --> 01:54:16,280
Go go to go to system preferences

1514
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:20,880
and then security and privacy

1515
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:22,840
and here

1516
01:54:22,840 --> 01:54:25,840
and then there will be a button in here
allow anyway

1517
01:54:26,920 --> 01:54:30,480
so I'll click on that and rerun it.

1518
01:54:30,480 --> 01:54:37,200
Okay.

1519
01:54:37,200 --> 01:54:42,240
Okay guys, when you run your code,
are you running this from here

1520
01:54:43,560 --> 01:54:46,920
or you're
running by right clicking on here?

1521
01:54:47,480 --> 01:54:51,440
Because some people I see they're still
their code is going to

1522
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:54,680
Google is navigating to Google
because I think

1523
01:54:54,960 --> 01:54:58,200
you guys are running from here
and you are running different

1524
01:55:00,080 --> 01:55:05,320
what's called different classes in here.

1525
01:55:05,320 --> 01:55:06,080
Okay.

1526
01:55:06,080 --> 01:55:09,240
So when you right click in here, run
task one.

1527
01:55:09,360 --> 01:55:14,960
It should be navigating to Amazon.com
and not Google.

1528
01:55:14,960 --> 01:55:24,360
Okay.

1529
01:55:24,360 --> 01:55:24,720
All right.

1530
01:55:24,720 --> 01:55:38,120
Any questions, guys, on the task?

1531
01:55:38,120 --> 01:55:40,440
No, the title is on the tab, right?

1532
01:55:40,760 --> 01:55:42,840
The title is what you have on the tab.

1533
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:45,720
The URL is,
what you have in that text box.

1534
01:55:45,720 --> 01:55:52,000
Right.

1535
01:55:52,000 --> 01:56:10,600
It's all the way around.

1536
01:56:10,600 --> 01:56:11,560
Okay. Got it.

1537
01:56:11,560 --> 01:56:14,040
All right, guys, let's continue.

1538
01:56:14,040 --> 01:56:14,400
Right.

1539
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:17,040
So we got this.

1540
01:56:17,040 --> 01:56:21,000
So now there is one more
thing that I want to show you

1541
01:56:24,200 --> 01:56:28,960
in here. So

1542
01:56:30,960 --> 01:56:33,080
let me create

1543
01:56:33,080 --> 01:56:36,720
a new class in here and name it is is

1544
01:56:44,760 --> 01:56:46,680
Navigate method.

1545
01:56:46,680 --> 01:57:16,560
Okay,

1546
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:20,880
So, all right,

1547
01:57:21,720 --> 01:57:31,440
I'm not sure if yours is working
without that.

1548
01:57:31,440 --> 01:57:32,880
Maybe this is running.

1549
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:36,600
What do you have in your previous class

1550
01:57:36,600 --> 01:58:02,280
in your launch browser?

1551
01:58:02,280 --> 01:58:08,200
What are where are you navigating in
launch browser class?

1552
01:58:08,200 --> 01:58:10,920
Send me this screenshot this. Okay.

1553
01:58:11,880 --> 01:58:15,120
Or it better send it to syntax support
guys.

1554
01:58:15,120 --> 01:58:15,800
Okay.

1555
01:58:15,960 --> 01:58:20,680
So we are a little behind,
so I need to finish some stuff in here,

1556
01:58:22,160 --> 01:58:31,640
but okay.

1557
01:58:32,440 --> 01:58:32,760
All right.

1558
01:58:32,760 --> 01:58:38,800
So I created, I created a new
a new class widget which I named Navigate.

1559
01:58:38,800 --> 01:58:39,640
Okay.

1560
01:58:39,720 --> 01:58:42,200
So I'm going to have
a new main method in here.

1561
01:58:43,280 --> 01:58:48,240
So what we're going to do in this
example is I'm going to show you

1562
01:58:49,360 --> 01:58:52,320
a different way to navigate to the

1563
01:58:53,400 --> 01:58:55,440
to some websites. Okay.

1564
01:58:55,440 --> 01:58:58,800
So before
what is it in the previous examples,

1565
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:01,720
what are the

1566
01:59:01,800 --> 01:59:03,160
what's called?

1567
01:59:03,160 --> 01:59:06,080
What are the method
that we used to navigate to be

1568
01:59:06,400 --> 01:59:10,800
to the URL guys?

1569
01:59:10,800 --> 01:59:12,320
It's a get method, right?

1570
01:59:12,320 --> 01:59:15,600
So now in here, so let's go ahead

1571
01:59:15,600 --> 01:59:18,040
and set the properties in here

1572
01:59:20,280 --> 01:59:22,720
right.

1573
01:59:22,720 --> 01:59:24,840
The driver

1574
01:59:26,920 --> 01:59:28,240
driver

1575
01:59:29,440 --> 01:59:38,120
and then drivers.

1576
01:59:38,120 --> 01:59:39,960
Chrome driver.

1577
01:59:40,920 --> 01:59:43,680
Yes. Setting the property is a must guys.

1578
01:59:44,080 --> 01:59:46,080
Okay.

1579
01:59:46,080 --> 01:59:49,000
Setting the property is a must.

1580
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:50,640
Okay. So we set the property.

1581
01:59:50,640 --> 01:59:54,480
So now what I will do, I'll go and create

1582
01:59:54,480 --> 01:59:57,320
a new object of the driver in here

1583
01:59:58,160 --> 02:00:02,120
which will help me to launch
Chrome Driver.

1584
02:00:02,440 --> 02:00:06,720
So now what we used to do, we used to

1585
02:00:07,400 --> 02:00:11,400
do Driver Right. Get.

1586
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:13,760
So let's

1587
02:00:13,760 --> 02:00:16,600
navigate, let's navigate to Facebook.

1588
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:17,640
Okay,

1589
02:00:18,360 --> 02:00:21,120
so let's do

1590
02:00:23,240 --> 02:00:25,520
so I'm just going to copy this URL.

1591
02:00:25,520 --> 02:00:27,600
Go back in here,

1592
02:00:27,920 --> 02:00:29,840
paste it in here. Okay.

1593
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:33,840
So now, guys,
there is a different way to navigate

1594
02:00:33,840 --> 02:00:36,560
to the to any your okay.

1595
02:00:36,960 --> 02:00:38,160
And it's pretty simple.

1596
02:00:38,160 --> 02:00:41,040
It's really simple English.

1597
02:00:41,040 --> 02:00:43,920
So what I'm going to do in here is

1598
02:00:44,360 --> 02:00:46,880
I will do driver that,

1599
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:50,320
navigate that too.

1600
02:00:50,800 --> 02:00:52,800
And then what I will do?

1601
02:00:52,800 --> 02:00:56,480
I will need to paste a euro in here.

1602
02:00:56,480 --> 02:00:59,840
So I'm just going to grab a URL
from Amazon

1603
02:01:01,920 --> 02:01:04,520
here and I will paste it in here.

1604
02:01:04,800 --> 02:01:05,440
Okay.

1605
02:01:05,440 --> 02:01:09,320
So there's two different methods
to navigate to the pages

1606
02:01:09,520 --> 02:01:13,480
that drive
and I get and navigate to, right?

1607
02:01:13,920 --> 02:01:18,200
So there is a slight difference in

1608
02:01:18,960 --> 02:01:22,280
navigate and get methods.

1609
02:01:23,600 --> 02:01:24,120
Okay.

1610
02:01:24,120 --> 02:01:27,040
So then the most important,

1611
02:01:28,920 --> 02:01:30,920
what's called difference between get

1612
02:01:30,920 --> 02:01:33,720
and navigate is navigate.

1613
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:34,840
With navigate.

1614
02:01:34,840 --> 02:01:37,960
You can move back and forward

1615
02:01:38,160 --> 02:01:41,400
and you can also refresh your page.

1616
02:01:42,080 --> 02:01:46,800
Okay, So this is the very important thing
that you need to know about it.

1617
02:01:46,800 --> 02:01:48,560
Navigate. Okay.

1618
02:01:48,560 --> 02:01:51,320
So if I run this right now,

1619
02:01:51,320 --> 02:01:54,840
so if I run this code right now,
so what's going to happen?

1620
02:01:55,560 --> 02:01:59,600
Am I going to navigate to Facebook
and then open up

1621
02:01:59,600 --> 02:02:03,240
another browser
and navigate to the Amazon?

1622
02:02:03,480 --> 02:02:06,760
Or how is this going to work? Guys

1623
02:02:10,040 --> 02:02:11,280
on the same window?

1624
02:02:11,280 --> 02:02:15,800
Okay, first, first, first to Facebook

1625
02:02:15,800 --> 02:02:19,680
and then to the Amazon on the same window.

1626
02:02:19,680 --> 02:02:20,520
Okay.

1627
02:02:20,520 --> 02:02:22,720
Probably open both in separate windows.

1628
02:02:22,720 --> 02:02:26,440
Okay. To

1629
02:02:27,480 --> 02:02:29,320
same browser, different tabs.

1630
02:02:29,320 --> 02:02:32,200
Okay, first

1631
02:02:32,400 --> 02:02:35,200
Facebook, then Amazon in the same browser.

1632
02:02:35,200 --> 02:02:36,040
Okay, good.

1633
02:02:36,040 --> 02:02:41,200
All right, so this will navigate.

1634
02:02:41,200 --> 02:02:44,440
Okay, let me run this and it's better
if you see it, right.

1635
02:02:44,440 --> 02:02:46,280
So I'm going to run this right now.

1636
02:02:47,520 --> 02:02:48,400
So let's see what's

1637
02:02:48,400 --> 02:02:52,160
going to happen.

1638
02:02:52,160 --> 02:02:52,520
Okay.

1639
02:02:55,640 --> 02:02:56,280
There you go.

1640
02:02:56,280 --> 02:02:57,280
Facebook.

1641
02:02:57,280 --> 02:03:00,040
So now Amazon right?

1642
02:03:00,040 --> 02:03:04,160
So what happened is
we went to Facebook first

1643
02:03:04,160 --> 02:03:09,800
and then our next line of code overridden
that the previous one.

1644
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,880
And we went to Amazon right

1645
02:03:12,880 --> 02:03:16,200
on the same tab on the same window.

1646
02:03:16,920 --> 02:03:23,400
Why? Because we have one
instance of the Chrome browser.

1647
02:03:23,640 --> 02:03:27,240
We only have we only launched one guys.

1648
02:03:27,560 --> 02:03:31,640
Okay, please keep in mind
if you have multiple,

1649
02:03:31,680 --> 02:03:35,120
if you want multiple different chrome
browsers,

1650
02:03:35,280 --> 02:03:39,840
you need to create more objects
off the web.

1651
02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:40,520
Okay.

1652
02:03:40,520 --> 02:03:43,320
So since we only have it on line ten,

1653
02:03:43,520 --> 02:03:46,440
that means we're launching
only one web browser.

1654
02:03:46,920 --> 02:03:51,720
Okay,
well, we'll be coming to creating new tabs

1655
02:03:51,720 --> 02:03:56,160
and going to the tab, then manipulating
with a tab in the future classes.

1656
02:03:56,400 --> 02:04:01,080
But right now, let's get this one
clear that we created one object.

1657
02:04:01,280 --> 02:04:04,560
That means we have only one Chrome
browser.

1658
02:04:05,160 --> 02:04:07,080
Okay?

1659
02:04:07,080 --> 02:04:10,200
And we will be performing actions on

1660
02:04:10,200 --> 02:04:12,880
one tab on one window only.

1661
02:04:13,200 --> 02:04:14,040
Okay.

1662
02:04:14,120 --> 02:04:17,640
So, so here

1663
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:22,000
we went to Facebook,
we went to Amazon after that.

1664
02:04:22,240 --> 02:04:22,880
Right?

1665
02:04:22,880 --> 02:04:27,960
So now what I want to do,
I want to go back to Facebook page.

1666
02:04:28,440 --> 02:04:32,480
Okay, so what I'm going to do
and here it is really simple

1667
02:04:32,880 --> 02:04:35,640
I will do driver that navigate

1668
02:04:36,280 --> 02:04:39,080
that back simple English.

1669
02:04:39,240 --> 02:04:43,560
You don't have to complicate this right
Driver that navigate back

1670
02:04:43,920 --> 02:04:47,200
which should take me back to the Facebook
page.

1671
02:04:47,600 --> 02:04:49,560
Okay, So let me run this.

1672
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:53,360
Let me run this and see

1673
02:04:53,360 --> 02:05:01,560
what's going to happen.

1674
02:05:01,560 --> 02:05:03,880
Okay. Running.

1675
02:05:03,880 --> 02:05:04,440
There we go.

1676
02:05:04,440 --> 02:05:06,840
Facebook page, guys.

1677
02:05:06,840 --> 02:05:13,920
Amazon.

1678
02:05:13,920 --> 02:05:19,520
And then it went back to Facebook.

1679
02:05:19,520 --> 02:05:24,240
We I hope all we all notice
that we went to Facebook Amazon

1680
02:05:24,400 --> 02:05:27,360
and then we went back to the Facebook

1681
02:05:27,840 --> 02:05:30,600
right.

1682
02:05:30,600 --> 02:05:34,680
No when you are navigating back
in this case we don't have to specify any

1683
02:05:34,680 --> 02:05:39,120
your route because we already specified
this one in here.

1684
02:05:39,120 --> 02:05:41,320
Okay. So pretty cool, right, guys?

1685
02:05:41,640 --> 02:05:44,640
So what if I want to go forward? It's

1686
02:05:45,840 --> 02:05:48,840
pretty easy driver

1687
02:05:48,840 --> 02:05:51,720
that navigate that forward.

1688
02:05:52,720 --> 02:05:55,800
Okay. Yes.

1689
02:05:56,280 --> 02:06:00,960
This is the main
like the main feature of navigate

1690
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:05,600
method is to go back forward
and to refresh the page.

1691
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:13,560
Okay.

1692
02:06:13,560 --> 02:06:15,960
Yes, it won't. So you're open.

1693
02:06:15,960 --> 02:06:19,840
You're opening
a completely new instance of the chrome

1694
02:06:19,840 --> 02:06:21,840
so it doesn't have any history.

1695
02:06:21,840 --> 02:06:25,480
So that's why it doesn't keep any history
before that.

1696
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,840
Okay.

1697
02:06:28,840 --> 02:06:29,240
All right.

1698
02:06:29,240 --> 02:06:30,280
So let's run this.

1699
02:06:30,280 --> 02:06:32,520
If I run this right now, where am I?

1700
02:06:32,520 --> 02:06:40,000
Ended up in here, guys,

1701
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:43,800
we need to.

1702
02:06:43,800 --> 02:06:44,240
Excuse me.

1703
02:06:44,240 --> 02:06:47,240
We need to end up in Amazon. Right.

1704
02:06:47,240 --> 02:06:59,760
So let me run this real quick.

1705
02:06:59,760 --> 02:07:05,040
So Facebook, Amazon, Right.

1706
02:07:05,040 --> 02:07:08,240
And then we need to go back again.

1707
02:07:08,240 --> 02:07:11,080
Facebook. And we went back

1708
02:07:12,080 --> 02:07:14,400
to Amazon again, right?

1709
02:07:14,680 --> 02:07:16,120
So pretty cool, right, guys?

1710
02:07:16,120 --> 02:07:18,840
Navigating back and forth

1711
02:07:18,840 --> 02:07:23,320
through the through the Web pages, right?

1712
02:07:23,320 --> 02:07:26,560
So now if I want to

1713
02:07:27,280 --> 02:07:31,320
let's say I navigated back and forth,
I ended up on Amazon.

1714
02:07:31,320 --> 02:07:35,560
So what I want to do now,
I want to refresh that page.

1715
02:07:35,760 --> 02:07:38,560
Okay, So easy as well guys

1716
02:07:39,720 --> 02:07:44,280
driver that navigate that refresh.

1717
02:07:44,760 --> 02:07:45,600
Okay.

1718
02:07:45,600 --> 02:07:47,680
Pretty straightforward
and easy methods in here.

1719
02:07:48,640 --> 02:07:52,560
So I'm not sure
if you going to be able to see this.

1720
02:07:52,560 --> 02:07:57,320
So but let's run this and see if
if we can spot that.

1721
02:07:57,320 --> 02:08:00,600
Okay, so I'm

1722
02:08:00,600 --> 02:08:07,200
running this again.

1723
02:08:07,200 --> 02:08:07,640
Okay.

1724
02:08:07,640 --> 02:08:11,120
Amazon,
we need to go back to Facebook right

1725
02:08:15,400 --> 02:08:17,000
from Amazon.

1726
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:21,440
Okay, There we go.

1727
02:08:21,960 --> 02:08:25,440
And it refreshed the page one more time.

1728
02:08:25,440 --> 02:08:26,040
Right?

1729
02:08:26,040 --> 02:08:29,840
So going back and forth
through the Facebook and Amazon in here

1730
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:33,120
and then at the very end
what we navigate to Amazon

1731
02:08:33,320 --> 02:08:35,880
it refreshed our page as well

1732
02:08:36,160 --> 02:08:38,400
right pretty pretty cool right guys

1733
02:08:38,960 --> 02:08:41,040
so manipulating with back and forth

1734
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,760
and refreshing the pages

1735
02:08:47,240 --> 02:08:48,880
it's not going to refresh for Facebook.

1736
02:08:48,880 --> 02:08:52,000
No it will refresh at the very end

1737
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:57,640
because at the very end on line 14,
we ending up on Amazon.

1738
02:08:57,640 --> 02:09:00,280
So that's the only page
it's going to refresh.

1739
02:09:00,720 --> 02:09:06,440
Okay.

1740
02:09:06,440 --> 02:09:11,280
No get get
method will not have this feature.

1741
02:09:11,320 --> 02:09:11,680
Okay.

1742
02:09:11,680 --> 02:09:16,200
Only navigate will have the feature
to go back and forth

1743
02:09:16,680 --> 02:09:21,200
and to refresh the page.

1744
02:09:21,200 --> 02:09:30,480
Okay.

1745
02:09:30,480 --> 02:09:32,520
I need to see a code comes up.

1746
02:09:32,520 --> 02:09:34,520
Okay.

1747
02:09:34,520 --> 02:09:35,640
All right.

1748
02:09:36,640 --> 02:09:38,680
So there's one more thing

1749
02:09:39,360 --> 02:09:41,840
that I want to show you guys in here.

1750
02:09:42,240 --> 02:09:46,080
So since we saw in previous examples that

1751
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:49,880
let's actually

1752
02:09:49,960 --> 02:09:52,200
put here as Google,

1753
02:09:52,920 --> 02:09:55,320
okay, because that's much

1754
02:09:56,240 --> 02:09:59,040
lighter, lighter website.

1755
02:09:59,040 --> 02:10:01,160
So it navigates really fast.

1756
02:10:01,160 --> 02:10:05,240
So if I run this right now,
so I think it should be faster

1757
02:10:05,240 --> 02:10:09,480
than running Amazon because Amazon
has lot of things on the website, right?

1758
02:10:09,480 --> 02:10:14,320
So that's why it's loading really
a little slower than usual.

1759
02:10:14,520 --> 02:10:15,360
Okay.

1760
02:10:15,480 --> 02:10:18,840
So if I go here Facebook, see it's

1761
02:10:18,960 --> 02:10:21,000
it's going really fast right now.

1762
02:10:21,920 --> 02:10:22,760
Okay.

1763
02:10:22,880 --> 02:10:25,320
So because Google is really light,

1764
02:10:26,480 --> 02:10:27,240
what's

1765
02:10:28,320 --> 02:10:30,520
website
and it doesn't have anything to load.

1766
02:10:30,800 --> 02:10:34,840
So what I want to do in this case, guys,
I want to do

1767
02:10:34,840 --> 02:10:39,880
I want to pause my execution
for a little bit, okay?

1768
02:10:40,120 --> 02:10:44,040
So that I can see visually
what is going on on my screen.

1769
02:10:44,400 --> 02:10:44,920
Okay.

1770
02:10:44,920 --> 02:10:47,520
Because right now,
when I run it, you saw that.

1771
02:10:47,760 --> 02:10:50,400
You saw that it was really fast.
It's going back and forth.

1772
02:10:50,400 --> 02:10:52,440
You don't really understand
what is going on. Right.

1773
02:10:52,800 --> 02:10:56,880
So what I want to do in this case
before I refresh,

1774
02:10:57,240 --> 02:11:01,480
I want to pause my execution
for a couple of seconds.

1775
02:11:01,920 --> 02:11:02,640
Okay.

1776
02:11:02,640 --> 02:11:05,240
So what I will do in here,

1777
02:11:05,240 --> 02:11:07,400
I will simply do thread

1778
02:11:09,040 --> 02:11:11,360
that's sleep, okay.

1779
02:11:11,360 --> 02:11:13,440
And this will accept

1780
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:17,240
an argument in milliseconds.

1781
02:11:17,760 --> 02:11:18,320
Okay.

1782
02:11:18,320 --> 02:11:21,960
So what I will do,
I want to pause this for 2 seconds

1783
02:11:21,960 --> 02:11:24,960
so that means I will need to enter this

1784
02:11:25,920 --> 02:11:28,160
here 2000 milliseconds.

1785
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:30,840
Okay. So

1786
02:11:31,960 --> 02:11:35,400
what I will need to do in here,
since it's not compiling.

1787
02:11:35,400 --> 02:11:36,000
Right.

1788
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,640
So what I will need to do,
just hover over guys

1789
02:11:38,920 --> 02:11:41,960
and do add exception to method signature.

1790
02:11:42,280 --> 02:11:42,680
Okay.

1791
02:11:42,680 --> 02:11:45,360
And then you're going to have this

1792
02:11:45,720 --> 02:11:49,440
throw interrupted exception,
but don't really pay attention to that.

1793
02:11:49,440 --> 02:11:52,120
We will be coming to those exception
handling later on.

1794
02:11:52,800 --> 02:11:54,720
Okay.

1795
02:11:54,720 --> 02:11:58,880
Is this clear, guys?

1796
02:11:58,880 --> 02:12:06,840
Any questions on this?

1797
02:12:06,840 --> 02:12:12,360
Okay.

1798
02:12:12,360 --> 02:12:15,520
If you have €3, yes, it's
going to be the same.

1799
02:12:15,520 --> 02:12:17,800
That's that's fine, guys.

1800
02:12:18,160 --> 02:12:22,600
I mean, they're you need to you need to
manipulate with back and forth, right?

1801
02:12:22,600 --> 02:12:25,960
So if you do back, it's
going to go to your second URL.

1802
02:12:26,160 --> 02:12:28,720
And then if you do it forward, it's
going to go back

1803
02:12:29,800 --> 02:12:30,880
to the third one.

1804
02:12:30,880 --> 02:12:39,960
So you need to
you need to see the logic yourself.

1805
02:12:39,960 --> 02:12:42,840
So the last part was I explained

1806
02:12:43,680 --> 02:12:48,080
this thread asleep
to pause and just add this

1807
02:12:49,040 --> 02:12:51,240
insight on the method signature.

1808
02:12:51,720 --> 02:12:54,120
Okay, so this is an exception handling.

1809
02:12:54,120 --> 02:12:56,760
This is don't pay attention to this
right now

1810
02:12:56,960 --> 02:12:59,880
because you will be covering this
in the last class of Java.

1811
02:13:00,120 --> 02:13:02,800
Okay.

1812
02:13:02,800 --> 02:13:05,400
This is not an implicit or explicit way.

1813
02:13:05,400 --> 02:13:07,520
This is just that

1814
02:13:07,560 --> 02:13:10,120
I'm pausing my thread.

1815
02:13:10,120 --> 02:13:11,040
Okay.

1816
02:13:11,040 --> 02:13:15,360
So whatever you run your code in Java,
you you open up a thread.

1817
02:13:15,400 --> 02:13:19,120
Okay,
so you paused that thread for 2 seconds,

1818
02:13:19,520 --> 02:13:23,400
so your execution goes
top to the bottom, right?

1819
02:13:23,400 --> 02:13:27,440
So when it comes to line 15,
what you need to do, it's

1820
02:13:27,440 --> 02:13:32,280
going to wait for 2 seconds
and then it will go to the line 16.

1821
02:13:32,640 --> 02:13:35,240
Okay, So I'm going to run this right now.

1822
02:13:35,760 --> 02:13:38,840
So now let's see
whenever it goes to Google

1823
02:13:39,120 --> 02:13:43,520
before it refreshes the page,
it will wait for 2 seconds.

1824
02:13:43,920 --> 02:13:47,600
Okay, So I'm on Facebook.

1825
02:13:49,040 --> 02:13:51,120
Go to Google, back to Facebook.

1826
02:13:51,720 --> 02:13:57,360
Google now 2 seconds
and it needs to refresh

1827
02:13:57,360 --> 02:14:02,120
the page, did it not or it did already?

1828
02:14:02,280 --> 02:14:03,360
I'm not sure.

1829
02:14:03,360 --> 02:14:05,760
I probably missed this.

1830
02:14:06,440 --> 02:14:07,520
Yeah, it did. Right?

1831
02:14:07,520 --> 02:14:10,800
Yeah, I didn't see it. Okay, cool.

1832
02:14:10,800 --> 02:14:11,160
All right.

1833
02:14:11,160 --> 02:14:14,000
So see, guys, it waited for 2 seconds.

1834
02:14:14,040 --> 02:14:16,080
That that means you are

1835
02:14:17,400 --> 02:14:19,560
here. It waited for 2 seconds.

1836
02:14:19,560 --> 02:14:24,640
It paused our execution for 2 seconds,
and then it refreshed our page.

1837
02:14:25,120 --> 02:14:25,960
Okay.

1838
02:14:26,400 --> 02:14:31,760
Any questions so far, guys?

1839
02:14:31,760 --> 02:14:36,640
Any confusion?

1840
02:14:36,640 --> 02:14:37,920
Okay, cool.

1841
02:14:37,920 --> 02:14:42,240
All right, so now we were talking about
so once I refreshed the page,

1842
02:14:42,240 --> 02:14:46,640
so at the very end, what we need to do
we need to quit the browser.

1843
02:14:47,560 --> 02:14:48,240
Right?

1844
02:14:48,440 --> 02:14:53,280
So some of you guys in the previous
example, some of you guys did

1845
02:14:56,120 --> 02:14:58,120
did drive a dot clothes.

1846
02:14:58,400 --> 02:14:58,720
Right.

1847
02:14:58,720 --> 02:15:00,720
And I'm going to explain how

1848
02:15:03,120 --> 02:15:05,880
how that driver
dark and drove that quit work.

1849
02:15:06,120 --> 02:15:10,400
Okay so what I will do in here

1850
02:15:10,400 --> 02:15:12,960
driver that clause.

1851
02:15:14,200 --> 02:15:18,000
Okay so

1852
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:22,560
and I will put driver
quit in here as well.

1853
02:15:23,040 --> 02:15:27,960
Okay so there is a slight difference
between close and quit.

1854
02:15:28,240 --> 02:15:29,080
Okay.

1855
02:15:29,160 --> 02:15:31,800
So if I go, let me open up this one.

1856
02:15:31,920 --> 02:15:32,360
Okay.

1857
02:15:32,360 --> 02:15:34,040
So I have a chrome in here.

1858
02:15:34,040 --> 02:15:36,160
So how many times do I have right now?

1859
02:15:36,160 --> 02:15:39,080
Guys, the top

1860
02:15:40,600 --> 02:15:42,360
two tabs. Right.

1861
02:15:42,360 --> 02:15:46,200
So if I do quit, guys,
if I do driver that quit,

1862
02:15:46,640 --> 02:15:50,160
it will turn Nate the whole session

1863
02:15:50,320 --> 02:15:55,560
and it will close all the available tabs
on this particular crop.

1864
02:15:56,400 --> 02:15:59,080
Okay, But if I close guys,

1865
02:15:59,280 --> 02:16:03,000
it will only close this particular tab.

1866
02:16:03,880 --> 02:16:07,160
Okay, so this is the slight difference

1867
02:16:07,520 --> 02:16:10,560
between those,
but we will not be seeing that.

1868
02:16:11,160 --> 02:16:15,440
We will not be seeing this right now
because we only working on one tab right

1869
02:16:15,440 --> 02:16:16,520
now. Okay.

1870
02:16:16,520 --> 02:16:20,800
But when we come to the point where
we will be manipulating with different

1871
02:16:21,040 --> 02:16:24,760
and multiple tabs,
you will see that difference in there.

1872
02:16:25,200 --> 02:16:26,920
Okay.

1873
02:16:26,920 --> 02:16:29,160
So you basically get quit is just

1874
02:16:31,080 --> 02:16:32,040
if I if I

1875
02:16:32,040 --> 02:16:34,800
right click in here you can see quit
right guys.

1876
02:16:35,120 --> 02:16:38,240
So if I do quit
it will close all the tabs.

1877
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:41,000
Right. It will.

1878
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:46,760
But if I close one tab inside the chrome
is just going to terminate one tab.

1879
02:16:46,760 --> 02:16:52,880
Okay, So that's the difference
it is in here.

1880
02:16:52,880 --> 02:16:53,760
Closed. Closed.

1881
02:16:53,760 --> 02:16:58,160
The current page
quit closed the whole session.

1882
02:16:58,520 --> 02:16:59,400
Okay,

1883
02:17:00,120 --> 02:17:03,040
so what we can do

1884
02:17:04,040 --> 02:17:10,920
will close the current tab.

1885
02:17:10,920 --> 02:17:13,320
And here

1886
02:17:13,920 --> 02:17:16,440
I will

1887
02:17:16,520 --> 02:17:19,200
quit the whole

1888
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:22,680
browser gap.

1889
02:17:22,680 --> 02:17:24,600
So I'm just going to

1890
02:17:25,320 --> 02:17:26,520
common this.

1891
02:17:26,520 --> 02:17:30,440
Okay.

1892
02:17:30,440 --> 02:17:31,200
Yeah. It's.

1893
02:17:31,200 --> 02:17:34,160
It's really useful
when you have multiple tabs.

1894
02:17:34,160 --> 02:17:38,480
Exactly.

1895
02:17:38,480 --> 02:17:39,360
All right.

1896
02:17:40,200 --> 02:17:40,520
Okay.

1897
02:17:40,520 --> 02:17:46,280
Any questions, guys?

1898
02:17:46,280 --> 02:17:47,600
Should be clear, Right.

1899
02:17:47,600 --> 02:17:49,520
Pretty straightforward.

1900
02:17:49,680 --> 02:17:50,480
Okay.

1901
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:51,360
All right.

1902
02:17:51,360 --> 02:17:53,960
So there's one more thing
that want to show you,

1903
02:17:54,360 --> 02:17:57,200
but I want to guess what
we've missed so far.

1904
02:17:57,400 --> 02:17:58,240
Okay?

1905
02:17:58,440 --> 02:18:02,600
So I want you to guess what
we've missed today.

1906
02:18:02,600 --> 02:18:04,760
So We launch the browser.

1907
02:18:04,760 --> 02:18:07,760
We navigated to some websites, right?

1908
02:18:08,320 --> 02:18:11,000
So what we did,
we navigated back and forth.

1909
02:18:11,280 --> 02:18:14,360
We closed the browser,
we refreshed the browser.

1910
02:18:14,680 --> 02:18:15,360
Right.

1911
02:18:15,400 --> 02:18:21,160
What is one thing
that is remaining for us?

1912
02:18:21,160 --> 02:18:22,680
Not really.

1913
02:18:22,680 --> 02:18:26,200
I'm not talking about performing
any actions on the web page.

1914
02:18:26,480 --> 02:18:28,920
I'm talking about the whole browser
itself.

1915
02:18:28,920 --> 02:18:32,760
Guys,

1916
02:18:32,760 --> 02:18:41,280
Any guesses?

1917
02:18:41,280 --> 02:18:43,480
It's state running within inside.

1918
02:18:44,120 --> 02:18:45,920
Make it full. What?

1919
02:18:45,920 --> 02:18:47,160
What do you mean by that?

1920
02:18:47,160 --> 02:18:48,680
Making for what?

1921
02:18:48,680 --> 02:18:49,680
Full screen?

1922
02:18:49,680 --> 02:18:50,880
Absolutely right.

1923
02:18:50,880 --> 02:18:55,080
We didn't maximize our browser.

1924
02:18:55,080 --> 02:18:55,720
Right?

1925
02:18:55,720 --> 02:19:00,680
So there's only one thing left
is to maximize our window.

1926
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:01,360
Right?

1927
02:19:01,360 --> 02:19:04,760
So we can do this with selenium as well.

1928
02:19:04,760 --> 02:19:08,520
What I'm going to do,
I'm going to create one more class in here

1929
02:19:09,080 --> 02:19:11,960
and name it as maximize

1930
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:15,480
window

1931
02:19:18,400 --> 02:19:20,520
main method, right?

1932
02:19:20,520 --> 02:19:24,920
So what I'm going to do in here,
first and foremost, what we need to do,

1933
02:19:25,240 --> 02:19:28,760
we need to set our property

1934
02:19:30,240 --> 02:19:30,840
right.

1935
02:19:31,160 --> 02:19:33,680
So what I will do in here

1936
02:19:37,120 --> 02:19:40,600
with Driver, the Chrome

1937
02:19:41,320 --> 02:19:42,560
driver,

1938
02:19:43,440 --> 02:19:51,560
and then where my driver is located.

1939
02:19:51,560 --> 02:19:54,680
And then I'm going to have that instance

1940
02:19:54,840 --> 02:19:57,480
right of my driver,

1941
02:19:57,880 --> 02:20:01,840
my web driver.

1942
02:20:01,840 --> 02:20:04,720
Okay, So now we'll launch the browser.

1943
02:20:04,920 --> 02:20:06,960
So what I want to do in here

1944
02:20:08,240 --> 02:20:12,840
is let's use actually let's go to Google.

1945
02:20:12,840 --> 02:20:14,120
That's fine.

1946
02:20:15,040 --> 02:20:16,920
So what I'm going to do,

1947
02:20:16,920 --> 02:20:19,200
going to navigate to Google.

1948
02:20:19,760 --> 02:20:26,840
Okay,

1949
02:20:26,840 --> 02:20:28,880
Going to navigate to Google in here.

1950
02:20:30,480 --> 02:20:42,280
Let's see see.

1951
02:20:42,280 --> 02:20:44,840
So your exception is not correct some.

1952
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:48,680
So you're you're doing IO exception.

1953
02:20:48,680 --> 02:20:49,920
That's not correct.

1954
02:20:49,920 --> 02:20:52,600
You do interrupted exception only.

1955
02:20:52,920 --> 02:20:53,560
Okay.

1956
02:20:53,560 --> 02:21:00,240
So yours is stating a no different.

1957
02:21:00,240 --> 02:21:00,800
Okay.

1958
02:21:00,800 --> 02:21:02,840
So let's move on in here.

1959
02:21:02,840 --> 02:21:04,560
So I'm navigating to Google.

1960
02:21:04,560 --> 02:21:07,400
Okay guys, So what I need to do in here,

1961
02:21:07,720 --> 02:21:10,840
I just need to maximize my window.

1962
02:21:10,840 --> 02:21:13,640
Okay, So it's pretty easy as well, guys.

1963
02:21:13,640 --> 02:21:18,840
So what I need to do
is driver that navigate, okay?

1964
02:21:19,240 --> 02:21:21,840
And then what I need to do is

1965
02:21:22,920 --> 02:21:23,800
not navigate.

1966
02:21:23,800 --> 02:21:25,080
I'm sorry, guys.

1967
02:21:25,360 --> 02:21:28,280
What I need to do,
I need to manage my windows.

1968
02:21:28,280 --> 02:21:28,920
Right?

1969
02:21:29,240 --> 02:21:31,520
So What I will do.

1970
02:21:32,040 --> 02:21:35,800
Driver that Manage
What am I managing in here?

1971
02:21:35,800 --> 02:21:37,920
I'm managing my window. Right.

1972
02:21:38,280 --> 02:21:40,400
So manage the window.

1973
02:21:40,680 --> 02:21:42,480
What am I trying to do?

1974
02:21:42,480 --> 02:21:45,640
I'm trying to maximize my window.

1975
02:21:46,400 --> 02:21:49,920
Okay, so let's run this and see

1976
02:21:50,120 --> 02:21:53,040
what's going to happen.

1977
02:21:53,040 --> 02:21:54,920
I'm not sure
if you're going to see it on the screen.

1978
02:21:54,920 --> 02:21:56,560
I hope it doesn't.

1979
02:21:56,560 --> 02:21:59,200
It doesn't maximizes
that window on the other screen

1980
02:21:59,200 --> 02:22:03,320
that I have yet.

1981
02:22:03,480 --> 02:22:06,520
As I said, guys,
as I said, guys, it's it's

1982
02:22:08,520 --> 02:22:10,720
it maximized the screen,

1983
02:22:10,720 --> 02:22:13,320
but it maximized it on other screen.

1984
02:22:13,320 --> 02:22:15,360
So that's why you didn't see it here.

1985
02:22:15,360 --> 02:22:19,080
But I hope when you run it
on your local guys, you will see that

1986
02:22:19,080 --> 02:22:22,840
it's maximized.

1987
02:22:22,840 --> 02:22:24,600
Yes, I will go over the

1988
02:22:25,680 --> 02:22:28,920
what's called difference
between full screen and maximize guys.

1989
02:22:28,920 --> 02:22:29,480
Okay.

1990
02:22:29,480 --> 02:22:33,360
So give me a couple of minutes.

1991
02:22:33,360 --> 02:22:33,680
Okay.

1992
02:22:33,680 --> 02:22:37,160
I hope everyone had their browsers

1993
02:22:37,160 --> 02:22:42,640
maximized.

1994
02:22:42,640 --> 02:22:44,640
Okay, cool. Nice.

1995
02:22:44,640 --> 02:22:45,080
All right.

1996
02:22:45,080 --> 02:22:47,280
So there's one more method

1997
02:22:48,200 --> 02:22:51,840
that some of you guys is to fullscreen.

1998
02:22:52,200 --> 02:22:56,960
Okay, so let me do Driver dot manage

1999
02:22:58,320 --> 02:23:01,840
window that fullscreen.

2000
02:23:02,440 --> 02:23:04,200
Okay.

2001
02:23:04,200 --> 02:23:07,440
So let me actually common this out.

2002
02:23:07,440 --> 02:23:10,440
Okay so let me run this and please

2003
02:23:10,440 --> 02:23:14,160
take a look at the difference guys
what can you notice in here?

2004
02:23:14,440 --> 02:23:25,520
I hope this is going
to a full screen in here, but let's see.

2005
02:23:25,520 --> 02:23:27,840
Okay. Launching this.

2006
02:23:27,840 --> 02:23:28,880
Okay. Nice.

2007
02:23:28,880 --> 02:23:32,040
So what did you notice on this screen,
guys?

2008
02:23:32,280 --> 02:23:35,680
What happened?

2009
02:23:35,680 --> 02:23:38,640
Full screen occupies the whole screen.

2010
02:23:38,640 --> 02:23:40,440
Absolutely right.

2011
02:23:40,440 --> 02:23:42,840
So you don't see the euro.

2012
02:23:42,840 --> 02:23:46,280
You don't see your bookmarks
you don't see the tabs.

2013
02:23:46,680 --> 02:23:47,400
Right.

2014
02:23:47,400 --> 02:23:51,600
So when you do maximize,
the browser only gets maximized

2015
02:23:51,600 --> 02:23:55,400
and not the the website.

2016
02:23:55,680 --> 02:23:56,160
Right.

2017
02:23:56,160 --> 02:23:59,400
When you do maximize, you can see a tabs,
you can see a euro,

2018
02:23:59,600 --> 02:24:03,680
you can see your bookmarks, you can see
everything for your window right.

2019
02:24:03,680 --> 02:24:06,680
So that's why you can just see
the difference between

2020
02:24:06,680 --> 02:24:09,720
full screen and maximize, right?

2021
02:24:10,760 --> 02:24:14,040
So this is the difference
between full screen and maximize.

2022
02:24:14,040 --> 02:24:15,520
Any questions on that, guys?

2023
02:24:15,520 --> 02:24:22,080
I hope that's clear.

2024
02:24:22,080 --> 02:24:26,440
Any Okay, sounds good.

2025
02:24:28,160 --> 02:24:31,520
So now let me go to the class
notes in here.

2026
02:24:32,080 --> 02:24:32,840
All right.

2027
02:24:32,840 --> 02:24:36,840
So now let's go over the get method

2028
02:24:38,160 --> 02:24:44,640
and navigate method.

2029
02:24:45,200 --> 02:24:46,080
Okay.

2030
02:24:46,080 --> 02:24:49,040
So what was the differences, guys?

2031
02:24:49,040 --> 02:24:51,400
What was the difference between get

2032
02:24:53,760 --> 02:24:55,520
how can we open a few tabs?

2033
02:24:55,520 --> 02:24:58,000
We will be going over those
in the next classes.

2034
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:08,640
Okay.

2035
02:25:08,640 --> 02:25:09,000
Okay.

2036
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:12,120
So Navigate will let you go back

2037
02:25:13,200 --> 02:25:15,840
and forward and you can refresh, right?

2038
02:25:15,840 --> 02:25:19,600
So navigate can

2039
02:25:22,360 --> 02:25:24,840
move back

2040
02:25:25,520 --> 02:25:28,680
forward and refresh.

2041
02:25:29,280 --> 02:25:31,720
Right. So this is one.

2042
02:25:31,720 --> 02:25:35,520
So there is two more differences.

2043
02:25:35,520 --> 02:25:37,640
Get and navigate.

2044
02:25:37,640 --> 02:25:41,280
Okay, So get

2045
02:25:42,080 --> 02:25:45,800
method will be waiting for your page

2046
02:25:46,040 --> 02:25:49,160
to fully load.

2047
02:25:49,160 --> 02:25:49,920
Okay.

2048
02:25:49,920 --> 02:25:55,080
So get method will wait for for the page.

2049
02:25:55,080 --> 02:25:58,200
Like let's say if you
if you're navigating to Amazon you can see

2050
02:25:58,200 --> 02:26:01,320
that it's taking time to load all the

2051
02:26:02,040 --> 02:26:05,600
all the
the whole page right it's spinning it

2052
02:26:05,600 --> 02:26:10,200
spinning for a couple more seconds
until the whole page is loaded Right.

2053
02:26:10,360 --> 02:26:15,480
So get method will wait for that
automatically

2054
02:26:15,480 --> 02:26:18,760
until your page is fully loaded

2055
02:26:19,080 --> 02:26:21,640
and navigate will not do that.

2056
02:26:22,200 --> 02:26:22,560
Okay,

2057
02:26:23,880 --> 02:26:25,400
so let me put it here.

2058
02:26:25,400 --> 02:26:29,520
Get will wait for the page

2059
02:26:30,680 --> 02:26:33,760
to fully load

2060
02:26:36,960 --> 02:26:38,600
whereas

2061
02:26:39,200 --> 02:26:41,600
navigate

2062
02:26:43,200 --> 02:26:44,080
on that.

2063
02:26:44,080 --> 02:26:44,880
Okay.

2064
02:26:45,120 --> 02:26:47,760
So this is

2065
02:26:47,760 --> 02:26:52,080
this is another difference
between get and navigate.

2066
02:26:52,080 --> 02:26:52,360
Right.

2067
02:26:52,360 --> 02:26:56,200
And there is one more difference
between get and navigate

2068
02:26:56,200 --> 02:27:00,600
that get will not keep the history off

2069
02:27:00,600 --> 02:27:03,560
your browser and navigate well.

2070
02:27:04,520 --> 02:27:06,600
Okay, so get

2071
02:27:09,760 --> 02:27:12,880
will not keep the history

2072
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:16,800
of the

2073
02:27:17,040 --> 02:27:18,240
browser

2074
02:27:21,840 --> 02:27:27,000
or not open date.

2075
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:28,440
Well okay.

2076
02:27:28,440 --> 02:27:31,400
So that's why that's why

2077
02:27:31,520 --> 02:27:35,280
you can move back and forward
by using navigate.

2078
02:27:35,760 --> 02:27:36,280
Okay.

2079
02:27:36,280 --> 02:27:39,960
So if you don't have any history,
you won't be able to move back and forth.

2080
02:27:40,200 --> 02:27:42,280
That's why I get doesn't have it.

2081
02:27:43,680 --> 02:27:44,960
Is that clear? You guys?

2082
02:27:44,960 --> 02:27:54,680
Any questions on this?

2083
02:27:54,680 --> 02:27:56,080
Okay, cool.

2084
02:27:56,080 --> 02:27:59,280
All right.
And then we talked about clothes

2085
02:28:00,480 --> 02:28:02,720
versus

2086
02:28:03,600 --> 02:28:06,600
quiet.

2087
02:28:06,600 --> 02:28:09,480
So clothes

2088
02:28:11,040 --> 02:28:13,880
or clothes,

2089
02:28:13,880 --> 02:28:17,040
the current tab

2090
02:28:19,200 --> 02:28:21,800
and quit

2091
02:28:23,640 --> 02:28:26,160
will cook the whole

2092
02:28:28,040 --> 02:28:29,000
browser.

2093
02:28:29,120 --> 02:28:29,880
Okay.

2094
02:28:30,200 --> 02:28:34,840
All right, guys,
any questions that what we've done

2095
02:28:34,840 --> 02:28:36,040
so far

2096
02:28:39,840 --> 02:28:41,320
and ran will wait

2097
02:28:41,320 --> 02:28:44,960
until Yeah, we'll
we'll be getting some challenges, guys.

2098
02:28:45,120 --> 02:28:45,680
Okay.

2099
02:28:45,680 --> 02:28:49,840
It's not that hard it
you just need to study and they'll and

2100
02:28:49,840 --> 02:28:54,040
it's it's all straightforward
you can see it's simple English guys

2101
02:28:54,040 --> 02:28:58,920
navigate get right get the care
and you're all refreshed back and forward.

2102
02:28:59,280 --> 02:29:00,920
It's all

2103
02:29:02,480 --> 02:29:05,560
it's all it's all simple English

2104
02:29:06,840 --> 02:29:09,560
in comparison, in comparison to Java.

2105
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:10,720
Right?

2106
02:29:10,800 --> 02:29:13,800
So when you look at Java,
you won't really understand

2107
02:29:13,800 --> 02:29:16,120
what is going on with hash sets and maps.

2108
02:29:16,120 --> 02:29:18,600
It's a bit confusing
until you get the logic.

2109
02:29:19,040 --> 02:29:22,600
But here it's simple English, so

2110
02:29:23,760 --> 02:29:25,800
selenium is not that difficult.

2111
02:29:26,120 --> 02:29:28,560
Okay. All right.

2112
02:29:28,560 --> 02:29:33,480
So there's one more thing
that I want to show you guys.

2113
02:29:33,480 --> 02:29:37,880
So whenever you running your test cases,
okay, guys,

2114
02:29:38,240 --> 02:29:41,280
so whenever you're running your test
cases, you

2115
02:29:42,480 --> 02:29:44,520
most of you guys are getting errors.

2116
02:29:44,520 --> 02:29:47,080
As I saw, there was a lot of errors today

2117
02:29:48,240 --> 02:29:51,120
where you
some of you guys can import anything

2118
02:29:51,120 --> 02:29:55,080
or some of you just give it a different

2119
02:29:56,480 --> 02:29:58,840
error path for your chrome driver.

2120
02:29:58,840 --> 02:29:59,440
Right.

2121
02:29:59,480 --> 02:30:02,640
So what I suggest to you guys is always

2122
02:30:03,080 --> 02:30:07,080
you run your automation whenever you run
your automated test cases.

2123
02:30:07,080 --> 02:30:10,920
If you get an error test,
please read that error.

2124
02:30:11,680 --> 02:30:14,160
Okay. It simple English as well.

2125
02:30:14,400 --> 02:30:16,320
So let me do one error.

2126
02:30:16,320 --> 02:30:18,040
Let me make an error in here.

2127
02:30:18,040 --> 02:30:20,040
Okay. And let's get something

2128
02:30:22,680 --> 02:30:23,160
in here.

2129
02:30:23,160 --> 02:30:24,440
So let me run this.

2130
02:30:24,440 --> 02:30:24,760
Okay.

2131
02:30:24,760 --> 02:30:27,440
So as you can see, this is not correct.

2132
02:30:27,880 --> 02:30:28,200
Right?

2133
02:30:28,200 --> 02:30:31,280
So I just I made a mistake, right?

2134
02:30:31,280 --> 02:30:33,840
I made a mistake knowingly.

2135
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:37,560
So let me run this
Let me run this in here and see

2136
02:30:37,880 --> 02:30:49,440
what's going to happen.

2137
02:30:49,440 --> 02:30:51,480
Is it actually easy, Asghar is.

2138
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:52,880
I don't know.

2139
02:30:52,880 --> 02:30:56,400
Well, it's always easy for me as well,
so it's probably

2140
02:30:56,920 --> 02:30:59,800
both.

2141
02:30:59,800 --> 02:31:02,560
Okay, now, guys,
let's take a look at the error.

2142
02:31:03,520 --> 02:31:06,320
It says exception in thread main.

2143
02:31:06,320 --> 02:31:09,240
Okay. Job blank. Illegal state exception.

2144
02:31:09,240 --> 02:31:10,360
That's fine. Okay.

2145
02:31:10,360 --> 02:31:12,040
We don't have to understand that.

2146
02:31:12,040 --> 02:31:14,600
But now let's take a look in here.

2147
02:31:14,600 --> 02:31:20,160
Driver executable doesn't exist
and it gives you the path, guys.

2148
02:31:20,400 --> 02:31:26,000
So it tells you that the driver
you just put in here, it doesn't exist.

2149
02:31:26,400 --> 02:31:26,960
Okay?

2150
02:31:26,960 --> 02:31:30,880
So that means that you put the wrong
the wrong name in here

2151
02:31:31,160 --> 02:31:34,440
or you specify the wrong folder at all.

2152
02:31:35,400 --> 02:31:35,840
Okay,

2153
02:31:37,200 --> 02:31:39,960
So you can actually click on this one.

2154
02:31:39,960 --> 02:31:42,880
It's going to it's going to get you

2155
02:31:42,880 --> 02:31:44,720
to the line number ten.

2156
02:31:44,720 --> 02:31:47,040
But the main error is right here.

2157
02:31:47,360 --> 02:31:52,440
Okay So, guys, whenever
you have any exceptions, any errors,

2158
02:31:52,760 --> 02:31:57,840
do not be afraid of those errors because
you will be getting a lot of those.

2159
02:31:57,840 --> 02:31:58,200
Okay.

2160
02:31:58,200 --> 02:32:00,280
So try to read what is going on.

2161
02:32:00,280 --> 02:32:03,360
Try to look at what line it's happening.

2162
02:32:03,600 --> 02:32:09,080
Okay, so this is simple English
and we know what is going on in here.

2163
02:32:09,080 --> 02:32:11,680
So you just need to do what's called

2164
02:32:12,680 --> 02:32:16,920
you just need to fix the
the path in here and.

2165
02:32:16,920 --> 02:32:19,520
It should be fine.

2166
02:32:19,520 --> 02:32:20,360
Okay.

2167
02:32:20,760 --> 02:32:22,320
And then

2168
02:32:22,760 --> 02:32:25,440
let's put the full screen

2169
02:32:25,440 --> 02:32:37,480
versus maximize maximize.

2170
02:32:37,480 --> 02:32:39,120
Okay.

2171
02:32:39,120 --> 02:32:43,000
So full screen, right.

2172
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:45,720
Why? It's showing
all these are the lines Because

2173
02:32:47,560 --> 02:32:48,600
because here.

2174
02:32:48,600 --> 02:32:52,440
So it's not only

2175
02:32:52,560 --> 02:32:54,280
these errors are coming,

2176
02:32:54,280 --> 02:32:57,680
you see from the chrome driver,
from the chrome driver service.

2177
02:32:57,680 --> 02:33:02,560
So these errors are coming
from the libraries that you imported guys.

2178
02:33:02,560 --> 02:33:05,440
So these errors are coming from selenium
libraries.

2179
02:33:06,720 --> 02:33:07,400
Okay.

2180
02:33:07,400 --> 02:33:12,840
So in ideally so ideally.

2181
02:33:12,840 --> 02:33:14,840
So there is an hierarchy.

2182
02:33:14,840 --> 02:33:17,800
Okay, I'll show you the next class,
the hierarchy

2183
02:33:17,800 --> 02:33:20,760
of the chrome
driver and web driver and everything.

2184
02:33:20,920 --> 02:33:24,400
So that you can see
all the all the hierarchy, how it goes.

2185
02:33:24,720 --> 02:33:29,280
So whenever you import a library, it's
not that just one class, right?

2186
02:33:29,440 --> 02:33:34,000
One library may contain hundred
classes, one library may contain ten.

2187
02:33:34,240 --> 02:33:37,480
It's up to the
it depends on the library import.

2188
02:33:37,880 --> 02:33:38,520
Okay.

2189
02:33:38,520 --> 02:33:41,560
So in this case, we have an error

2190
02:33:41,560 --> 02:33:44,880
about the what's called about the path.

2191
02:33:45,160 --> 02:33:50,320
So it all all these are coming from chrome
driver driver service and all

2192
02:33:51,360 --> 02:33:52,440
other classes that

2193
02:33:52,440 --> 02:33:54,880
are inside the libraries
that you import it.

2194
02:33:55,440 --> 02:34:05,000
Okay.

2195
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:07,280
All right. So screen versus maximize,

2196
02:34:08,520 --> 02:34:10,840
let's put it maximize

2197
02:34:13,680 --> 02:34:17,320
will maximize the

2198
02:34:18,360 --> 02:34:19,960
browser

2199
02:34:22,840 --> 02:34:28,240
and will not

2200
02:34:30,600 --> 02:34:33,240
and let's say

2201
02:34:35,320 --> 02:34:36,880
and you'll

2202
02:34:37,400 --> 02:34:40,560
still be able

2203
02:34:40,560 --> 02:34:43,000
to see your

2204
02:34:44,360 --> 02:34:46,840
tabs and bookmarks.

2205
02:34:48,440 --> 02:35:01,520
Okay.

2206
02:35:01,520 --> 02:35:03,960
Full screen

2207
02:35:07,120 --> 02:35:11,160
will maximize

2208
02:35:15,160 --> 02:35:18,240
the whole web

2209
02:35:18,240 --> 02:35:19,560
application.

2210
02:35:19,560 --> 02:35:19,800
Okay.

2211
02:35:19,800 --> 02:35:24,760
I hope this is clear, guys.

2212
02:35:24,760 --> 02:35:26,040
It's not working for me.

2213
02:35:26,040 --> 02:35:28,160
It just freezes

2214
02:35:28,800 --> 02:35:32,040
these is something we're probably I'm

2215
02:35:32,640 --> 02:35:36,240
not sure actually,
I haven't really seen that issue before.

2216
02:35:36,720 --> 02:35:39,760
So if you do full screen, it freezes

2217
02:35:41,360 --> 02:35:41,560
that.

2218
02:35:41,560 --> 02:35:47,160
That is weird.

2219
02:35:47,160 --> 02:35:49,320
It freezes your execution.

2220
02:35:50,120 --> 02:35:55,160
Josef, is that what's going on?

2221
02:35:55,160 --> 02:35:56,640
Oh, it freezes the execution.

2222
02:35:56,640 --> 02:35:57,760
Now, that is weird.

2223
02:35:57,760 --> 02:36:00,040
Okay, I haven't seen this.

2224
02:36:00,040 --> 02:36:01,600
Yeah, that's why

2225
02:36:02,040 --> 02:36:05,440
I forgot to mention
that full screen is not that used.

2226
02:36:05,440 --> 02:36:08,720
Okay, so maximize is the most used

2227
02:36:09,640 --> 02:36:12,600
method to maximize the screen to work on.

2228
02:36:12,640 --> 02:36:21,240
Okay.

2229
02:36:21,240 --> 02:36:21,480
All right.

2230
02:36:21,480 --> 02:36:26,160
I guess any other questions
on what we have covered

2231
02:36:26,160 --> 02:36:34,040
so far?

2232
02:36:34,040 --> 02:36:36,120
I hope you guys are having fun. It's

2233
02:36:37,320 --> 02:36:40,200
what selenium integrating with Java

2234
02:36:41,240 --> 02:36:43,680
right today.

2235
02:36:43,720 --> 02:36:45,800
So very cool. Okay.

2236
02:36:47,200 --> 02:36:48,480
Okay, that's good.

2237
02:36:48,480 --> 02:36:50,240
That's good, guys.

2238
02:36:50,240 --> 02:36:54,520
Um, we will be doing more fun tomorrow.

2239
02:36:55,080 --> 02:36:55,800
Okay.

2240
02:36:55,800 --> 02:36:59,080
So we will be actually
clicking on everything.

2241
02:36:59,080 --> 02:37:01,480
We will be typing on the web pages.

2242
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:03,000
Okay.

2243
02:37:04,320 --> 02:37:07,680
So, so

2244
02:37:07,680 --> 02:37:11,040
we're going to have a lot of a lot of fun,
guys.

2245
02:37:11,240 --> 02:37:17,760
Okay. Yes.

2246
02:37:17,760 --> 02:37:20,640
I mean, we got it's
going to get harder and harder, guys.

2247
02:37:20,640 --> 02:37:21,480
Okay.

2248
02:37:21,600 --> 02:37:26,520
But the main thing for
you guys is to note Java.

2249
02:37:26,520 --> 02:37:26,920
Okay?

2250
02:37:26,920 --> 02:37:30,000
So if you know Java and you know
how to build the logic with Java,

2251
02:37:30,240 --> 02:37:36,000
Selenium is just easy.

2252
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:37,360
Maximize.

2253
02:37:37,360 --> 02:37:53,080
Sure.

2254
02:37:53,080 --> 02:37:53,800
Okay.

2255
02:37:56,680 --> 02:37:59,120
Okay, guys, any other questions?

2256
02:37:59,640 --> 02:38:03,600
Any other questions
that you guys want to ask?

2257
02:38:04,440 --> 02:38:08,400
It doesn't have to be selenium guys,
since we have 15 minutes.

2258
02:38:09,720 --> 02:38:10,240
If not,

2259
02:38:10,240 --> 02:38:14,600
we can.

2260
02:38:14,600 --> 02:38:15,960
We can wrap it up.

2261
02:38:15,960 --> 02:38:17,040
Oh, do we have a homework?

2262
02:38:17,040 --> 02:38:19,200
That's a very good question.
Okay, let me see.

2263
02:38:19,560 --> 02:38:24,000
I forgot about that.

2264
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:25,920
How do you hack Google?

2265
02:38:25,920 --> 02:38:35,240
We can't for now.

2266
02:38:35,240 --> 02:38:38,480
Okay, let me see.

2267
02:38:38,480 --> 02:38:39,960
Yeah, there's.

2268
02:38:39,960 --> 02:38:42,680
Okay, so I don't have any homework

2269
02:38:42,680 --> 02:38:46,120
for today's class,
but I will have homework for tomorrow.

2270
02:38:46,680 --> 02:38:51,680
Okay, so tomorrow
I'll give you two to homeworks,

2271
02:38:51,680 --> 02:38:54,000
which you will have
a lot of different practice.

2272
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:57,520
Okay, so

2273
02:38:57,680 --> 02:39:00,160
you only need to have Jeff Bezos
his account.

2274
02:39:00,160 --> 02:39:01,960
Okay. Good luck.

2275
02:39:01,960 --> 02:39:09,200
Good luck with that. Uh,

2276
02:39:10,680 --> 02:39:11,840
yes, I will.

2277
02:39:11,840 --> 02:39:16,320
I'll push this code in GitHub, guys
but seems like I'm

2278
02:39:16,320 --> 02:39:20,400
not able to find the the password.

2279
02:39:21,160 --> 02:39:24,240
So I asked Samir for this,
so I'm waiting for the password.

2280
02:39:24,240 --> 02:39:28,640
So once I get that password,
I will be pushing everything to the

2281
02:39:28,680 --> 02:39:32,240
new repository and I will send it to you
in the course announcements.

2282
02:39:32,440 --> 02:39:34,200
Okay.

2283
02:39:34,200 --> 02:39:39,760
And for, for the slides guys,
I will be uploading slides in canvas,

2284
02:39:39,960 --> 02:39:43,840
but I don't have the password for canvas
as well, so I'm waiting for that.

2285
02:39:43,840 --> 02:39:44,400
Okay.

2286
02:39:44,400 --> 02:39:48,880
Once I get all that information,
I will upload everything, push the code

2287
02:39:49,200 --> 02:39:52,880
and I will
I will notify you guys and course

2288
02:39:52,880 --> 02:40:06,280
announcements.

2289
02:40:06,280 --> 02:40:09,640
I will be your instructor
for all the selenium classes. Yes.

2290
02:40:09,640 --> 02:40:21,240
Correct.

2291
02:40:21,240 --> 02:40:21,640
Okay.

2292
02:40:21,640 --> 02:40:25,200
If can we create a program
where we can purchase things?

2293
02:40:25,400 --> 02:40:28,200
Yeah, you can. You can.

2294
02:40:28,200 --> 02:40:31,480
But it's, it's going to be in the later
classes.

2295
02:40:31,480 --> 02:40:31,840
Okay.

2296
02:40:31,840 --> 02:40:37,160
So let us let us learn
how to perform actions on the web pages.

2297
02:40:37,160 --> 02:40:39,520
Then you should be able to do it yourself.

2298
02:40:39,520 --> 02:40:40,960
Okay, so that's easy.

2299
02:40:40,960 --> 02:40:45,600
That shouldn't be really big deal.

2300
02:40:45,600 --> 02:40:47,760
Class two type. Okay. To type.

2301
02:40:48,480 --> 02:40:51,720
Okay, sure.

2302
02:40:51,720 --> 02:40:53,120
If I give you.

2303
02:40:53,120 --> 02:40:53,680
Okay.

2304
02:40:53,680 --> 02:40:55,120
Sounds good. That's okay.

2305
02:40:55,120 --> 02:40:56,880
So let's do this guys thing.

2306
02:40:56,880 --> 02:40:59,800
So let's have 20 minute breaks.

2307
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:00,760
Okay.

2308
02:41:00,760 --> 02:41:02,760
15 minute and actual break.

2309
02:41:02,760 --> 02:41:05,240
5 minutes for you guys to type.

2310
02:41:05,240 --> 02:41:09,000
How about that?

2311
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:12,720
So that way
you guys can type in in 5 minutes.

2312
02:41:12,720 --> 02:41:16,480
It shouldn't be really big deal, right.

2313
02:41:16,480 --> 02:41:18,440
And one minute to send them.

2314
02:41:18,440 --> 02:41:19,120
Sounds good.

2315
02:41:19,120 --> 02:41:20,240
That's a very good plan.

2316
02:41:20,240 --> 02:41:22,920
I like that.

2317
02:41:22,920 --> 02:41:23,360
Okay.

2318
02:41:23,360 --> 02:41:27,360
On tomorrow's
agenda, guys, So please take a look at

2319
02:41:30,320 --> 02:41:32,760
what the web element

2320
02:41:32,760 --> 02:41:36,160
is and please take a look at the locators.

2321
02:41:36,800 --> 02:41:37,480

2326
02:42:07,120 --> 02:42:11,240

and see if I can find anything on the.

2331
02:42:30,960 --> 02:42:34,280
Yeah, for now,
it doesn't seem like it is obvious

2332
02:42:34,280 --> 02:42:41,560
because I haven't seen this issue
before, so.

2333
02:42:41,560 --> 02:42:44,160
