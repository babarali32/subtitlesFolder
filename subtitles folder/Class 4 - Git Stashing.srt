1
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,240
It's not going to work.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,080
But the purpose of good
is to make your life easier, right?

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,360
So I would recommend
that it's very important

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,440
that you get a very deep inside
of how special it truly works.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,920
Okay.

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,640
So let's begin out today's session.

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,960
And let me just give you a scenario.

8
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,520
So here is our scenario.

9
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,720
We are working in a company
and what happens

10
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,920
is that
one day we get an email from our Lee.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,400
He says that, okay,
you need to build a car.

12
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,920
That's it.

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,960
Build a car.

14
00:00:53,040 --> 00:01:01,920
This is the plan?

15
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,840
No, nothing like that.

16
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,280
Okay, so in while discussing it,
we won't be focusing

17
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,000
on any kind of framework or any stuff
you'll be just focusing on.

18
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,560
So don't worry about that.

19
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,920
It's only going to get.

20
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,080
Okay, so now I want to build a car.

21
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,080
What I would do simply go to my encourage,
first of all.

22
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,960
Now, that's not a problem.

23
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,920
Start building it right away.

24
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,200
So let's open up

25
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,960
a new project,

26
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,960
a new job project.

27
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,840
Get that?

28
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,920
Yes. You guys should follow.

29
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,960
Open up a new project window.

30
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,680
Just name it.

31
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,440
It's fashion or whatever you want to.

32
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,360
Okay.

33
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:28,640
Let me know once you are done
with the creation of the project.

34
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,280
Okay,
so now let's create a new class over here.

35
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,320
Let's animate car basics.

36
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,440
So I have up last name car business.

37
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,520
So what are the few basic
things that I can have

38
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,520
in this part of the class?

39
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,000
My car is going to have a color, right?

40
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,640
It's going to have

41
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,880
engine.

42
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,160
It will have doors

43
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,600
number.

44
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,160
So let's have color in gender and numbers.

45
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,760
These are the four things that I have in
here.

46
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,280
Let's go to our main

47
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:51,480
and let's say the basic structure.

48
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,560
So this point.

49
00:03:52,560 --> 00:04:04,320
Do you guys think that I should
now make a comment of my good.

50
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,200
But what about the rest of you?

51
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,560
Do you guys think that
I should make a comment

52
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:22,920
public?

53
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,200
So all the time, it's very important
to build this sense

54
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,760
of knowing that

55
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,560
when you should commit people,
you should not make unnecessary comments,

56
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,440
because that's going to create a lot of I
this guy, which is not desired.

57
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,720
You should not have massive comments

58
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,440
like the comments which serve no purpose.

59
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,640
It's very important to develop this sense

60
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,040
in you guys
and I'm going to help you build that.

61
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,040
Okay.

62
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,760
So right now

63
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,240
what I see is that I need to build a car
and I have some basic structure available.

64
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,760
I have one class in which

65
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,280
there is like basics of the car
which are going to be there.

66
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,960
And I have a mean

67
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,480
the next of the stuff that I will be
building is going to change. Like

68
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,120
I can give it any number,

69
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,480
any color and stuff like that,
which I have not decided yet.

70
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,440
So I'm sure about one thing
that these two things,

71
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,040
the main and the car business,
they are going to stay here.

72
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,040
So what do you guys think now?

73
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,320
Should I make a commit
of this particular code

74
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:33,600
at this point?

75
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,680
Okay.

76
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,800
I'm going to repeat again.

77
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:43,320
I think I should
I should make a comment. Why?

78
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:47,400
Okay.

79
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,840
So we are to develop a car, right?

80
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,680
We are to develop a car.

81
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,560
And we know that our car is going to have

82
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,720
color and gender number.

83
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,360
Right.

84
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,120
These are some of the constants
that are going to be there.

85
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,680
We know this

86
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:07,680
and we know

87
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,800
that we will be creating
an object of the last car.

88
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,040
We are sure about this.

89
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,600
This stuff.

90
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,280
I'm sure that

91
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,320
this stuff is going to be here in my code.

92
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,600
The rest of the things that I will be

93
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,720
writing down, like car color,
assigning it the color,

94
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,600
assigning it
the number, assigning it in the number.

95
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,560
I have not decided it yet.

96
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,080
And it can change over to die
in my decision.

97
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,280
Like I may see that, okay,
the car is going to be red

98
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,600
because in the requirements,
if I show you guys,

99
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,320
I was not given
any particular requirement.

100
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,760
Right. It was just build the car.

101
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,320
It did not tell me that.

102
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,160
What kind of cars you should build.

103
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,280
So I have developed a basic structure.

104
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:02,320
It's good practice to commit
my basic structure so that at least it

105
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,760
remains sealed.

106
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,520
And if anyone wants to see my progress,
you can see that.

107
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:06,840
Okay.

108
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,960
I have started
working on the basic structure

109
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,840
and the rest of the stuff
is still going to be in the pipeline.

110
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,440
Now, does it make sense?

111
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,240
Okay.

112
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,640
So should I be making a comment right now?

113
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,720
Okay, So in order to make a comment,

114
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,240
I simply open up my

115
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,640
explorer.

116
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:40,200
I go to this particular location
where my files are,

117
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,840
and I'll simply say,

118
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:52,640
get back here.

119
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,400
Okay, guys,

120
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,800
to know what I want to do is
I want to ignore the dot idea file.

121
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,800
And I also want to ignore the out file
that is going to be there.

122
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:19,960
So what we will do.

123
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:26,280
Okay, the command is touch dot,
get ignore.

124
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:26,680
Okay,

125
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,120
it created a dot.

126
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,720
Get ignored file.

127
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,360
I'll open up this file
and I'll enter in here

128
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,560
slash dot idea and slash out.

129
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,840
The alcohol out file is not yet here,
but it will be here in the future.

130
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,520
I know that.
And I don't want it to be tracked.

131
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,760
So I just added the both names in here.

132
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:53,280
Now, to save this file,
let me know when you guys have done this.

133
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,000
Ignore file and enter these two

134
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,840
files.

135
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,000
Okay, so

136
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,520
I'll say get in it to initialize

137
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,920
my repository, have it initialized,

138
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,520
and then I'd say get status

139
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,320
update.

140
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,360
So it's only going to create an SRT email
and dot it ignore.

141
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,880
I'm good enough with that.

142
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,560
That said, get add dot

143
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:30,720
and get commit dashcam. Now

144
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,440
I'm not going to name my commits

145
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,160
random like we used to do before.

146
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,120
I'm going to try to name them

147
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,560
as much descriptive as they can be.

148
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:51,720
So what do you guys that just that
I should name this part of the comment.

149
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,040
It should be descriptive enough
so that if anyone reads it, it knows that

150
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,560
what is in there?

151
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,720
No, you'll be done.

152
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,240
That's not something
that we are going to name it.

153
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:03,960
No more Hammer

154
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:05,920
Bar one.

155
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,440
No, it's not

156
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,720
a gain of defining

157
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,280
part.

158
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,680
Last the basics of body

159
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,720
we ignored in text

160
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,480
these two files dot idea and out of it.

161
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,120
So I'm going to name it.

162
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:35,160
The basic structure of our is ready

163
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,240
Yeah without any features.

164
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,280
So the more description
we can add, the more good

165
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,160
it is.

166
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,360
Okay.

167
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,880
There you go.

168
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,920
And now let me see if I do with.

169
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,600
It shows me
the basic structure of it is ready

170
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,600
without any features
and my head is pointing towards it.

171
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,680
Are we all good

172
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:22,040
till this one?

173
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,160
No, I don't.

174
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,920
I don't know why we do it. The message.

175
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:38,440
I think that it's if it's not a done.

176
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,080
Okay, great.

177
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,520
So let me just a bit my simulation

178
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,040
over here.

179
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,120
What we did is

180
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,600
we have key files

181
00:11:51,600 --> 00:12:02,000
that ignore SIRC.

182
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,240
Good.

183
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,520
Ignore there.

184
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,120
And we have as far see

185
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:11,880
what's

186
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,760
going on. We are.

187
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,440
Just wait a moment. I'll go back.

188
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,760
So we didn't get at Dot in which

189
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,040
we placed
all the files in the staging area

190
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,200
and we made up comments

191
00:12:43,600 --> 00:13:04,240
this.

192
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,720
Okay, so there you go. Here is a terminal.

193
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,760
You want to have a look at it?

194
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,640
What do I do if I get decode

195
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,240
this?

196
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,920
You need to write type in Q
It will get you up.

197
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:32,880
Rescue and press enter.

198
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,680
Okay. Guys are good.

199
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:42,920
All of us.

200
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,560
Okay, great.

201
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,880
Now let's start

202
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,880
building that car.

203
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:55,840
So let's say the car color is red.

204
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,720
Oh, and its engine is

205
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:07,240
that same. And

206
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,680
we also have the number of doors.

207
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,520
Let's make them to for now

208
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:27,760
and let's have the number.

209
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,200
Okay.

210
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,760
So these are the features
that are assigned to this particular car.

211
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,400
And then I said, okay, let's have a look.

212
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,400
How does it look?

213
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,560
So system dot out-of-print album

214
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,400
card, dog color

215
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,400
or display, whatever there is.

216
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,800
So let's assume that after writing down
this whole cord,

217
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,880
I pressed the play button

218
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,440
and it shows me my car,
which I just developed.

219
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:08,440
I can see it visually.

220
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,280
I'm giving you guys one minute
to reach this point

221
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,320
and then you'll be proceeding together

222
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:27,840
here.

223
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,240
You about that

224
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:37,000
and I'll give you all good.

225
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,840
So when I press this button,

226
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,920
let's assume that we are able
to see the car that we just need.

227
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,920
And it's a beautiful red

228
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,880
car, two doors and,
you know, it's pretty awesome.

229
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:54,120
But I got one eye contact.

230
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,200
Okay?

231
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,200
I don't want this red car.

232
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,000
Maybe the blue car is going to look better
like, no, I'm

233
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,120
not decisive enough right now.

234
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,680
So I want to make some changes in here.

235
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,960
But I don't want to lose this goal,
which I have already written.

236
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,840
So what do you guys suggest?
What should I do?

237
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,080
I don't want to lose this good.

238
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:27,200
And I want to make some changes in.

239
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:33,080
Okay, so
you guys are saying that committed right?

240
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,360
Okay.

241
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,280
The problem that the commit is going to be
that this particular car

242
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:43,560
is going to be during the coming history
and it's going to be a redundant commit.

243
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,680
If I plan on changing the car

244
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,880
and making a new one, it's
going to be redundant.

245
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,560
Coming.

246
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,600
So I cannot make a commitment because
I have I'm not finalized with my decision.

247
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,400
So that's the building of the Senate
that whenever we make a commit,

248
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,440
we should be final,
we should be final with our decision

249
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:12,000
that, okay,
this is what we actually want to happen.

250
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,160
Use always understand
what you need to change and know.

251
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,520
Yes, exactly. My

252
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,200
right that

253
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:26,160
that was obvious right of you.

254
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:33,200
So what we can do and get a very
beautiful feature we can use thing.

255
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,960
What is that. Let me give you a look.

256
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,240
So what we did,
we made some changes in our SRT, right?

257
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,760
I'm representing
those changes of the vehicle.

258
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,360
We made those changes.

259
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,720
And then what we want to do
is we want to redo them.

260
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,560
So what are we going to do?

261
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,520
We are going to run
the command, get stashed.

262
00:17:55,560 --> 00:18:03,080
These do not run it right now.

263
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,760
We are going to run.

264
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,480
The command gives Dash
along with a message.

265
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:10,280
And what it is going to do
is it's going to pick up

266
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,120
our changes

267
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,960
and it is going to place them

268
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:21,480
inside of the station area.

269
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:26,760
And along with that, it's
going to revert the condition

270
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,800
of the working
that the same as the one in the wrap.

271
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:35,000
So it's going to pick up this horsepower
from the repo and it's going to place it

272
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:42,400
over here and it's going to just,
you know, the media.

273
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:48,440
So this is what's going to happen is
this one is a little clear to all of you.

274
00:18:48,440 --> 00:19:00,160
Okay, one more time, I'll great.

275
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,240
No problem.

276
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,160
Okay.

277
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,920
Okay, guys, let's have a look at that.

278
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,200
I want what I did is,

279
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,360
was I made some changes
and the ICRC right.

280
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,640
I made some changes in here.

281
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,320
Do you guys agree with that?

282
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,560
And those changes? I can see that I added

283
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,320
the features of the car.

284
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,000
These are the changes that I need.

285
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,800
But I'm not sure that
whether I want to have this car or not,

286
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,560
maybe I want a blue car
or maybe I want to be in car.

287
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,560
I don't know about that right now.

288
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,960
So now I can make changes
and not lose the previous changes.

289
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,160
What I can do is I can use get staff.

290
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,200
It's going to pick up the changes

291
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,840
and it's going to place it in a stash
inside the target folder.

292
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,240
Along with that, what will happen

293
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:01,000
with the working type?

294
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,360
The working party is going to be reverted

295
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,800
to the speed
of the last commit in the rapport.

296
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,760
So it's going to pick up the source file
from the wrap group

297
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,760
and it's going to replace it in here

298
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:26,280
like this. Yes.

299
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:31,600
Why is if you don't need that,
I know we may need that in the future.

300
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,280
Maybe in future.

301
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,360
I don't like the blue car and
I want the right kind of game back then.

302
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:35,760
What?

303
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:43,200
I don't want to lose that cool.

304
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,960
Okay,
so is the workflow clear to all of you?

305
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,000
Because this is the only thing
regarding the stuff.

306
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
And if you have to eat about this,
we are good with session.

307
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,240
That's it.

308
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,200
This is how staffing works

309
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,200
and newbie.

310
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:07,920
Thank you.

311
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,960
You've got the answer

312
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,200
yes now.

313
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,480
Okay, so I'm going to do it.

314
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,880
I'll just move it back
and we will do this again

315
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,440
along with the time out.

316
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:23,520
Okay, guys.

317
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,920
So this is the current condition
of my working directory, right?

318
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,200
The SRT, you can
read means that I have made some changes.

319
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,320
What are those changes?

320
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:38,040
These are the candidates.

321
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:43,000
So let's open up the terminal.

322
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,640
Okay.

323
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:48,960
If I want to stack them, I want to bring
those changes in the starting area.

324
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Which command should I use?

325
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,840
Get dash, dash and

326
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,640
now name it.

327
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:04,440
Red car.

328
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:04,760
Okay.

329
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,840
Run this command only on your terminal
and let me know

330
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:17,960
once you are done with that.

331
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,520
Okay.

332
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:25,040
When I ran this command, what happened?

333
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:29,120
Okay, so this is going to move
to the stacking area

334
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,120
and what is going to happen to our working
directory?

335
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:36,000
It's going to pick up the SRT file
from the latest commit

336
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,920
and it's going to bring it back
to the working directory.

337
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,720
So now let's open up our intelligent
and see that

338
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,480
whether this is the scenario or not.

339
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,720
Okay, so was this our first time in

340
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,680
the latest test?

341
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:58,800
Was this the latest coming?

342
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:06,280
So this is how it actually works.

343
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:26,160
So yes, that's

344
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:32,040
the upgrade that that literally happened,
that's there.

345
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,920
No way it's going to be there.

346
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:41,640
We'll discuss that knowing, okay,
now let's start this.

347
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,040
Let's start building our

348
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,480
jealously guard, basically.

349
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,640
Yes, sure. I'm going to share it

350
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,680
because we know
you can have it in the chat.

351
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,680
Okay.
So let's start building our next car.

352
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,840
And that would be the blue car corridor.

353
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,640
Color is equal to, let's say, blue.

354
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,160
This time,

355
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,640
dot number is equal

356
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:14,280
to let's enter the engine.

357
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:18,200
Engine is equal to

358
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,760
odd doors.

359
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,040
Let's make it a model car this time

360
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,880
because, you know,
I just wanted to see that.

361
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,200
How does a two car, a two door car

362
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,200
look and how does a full door car look?

363
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:43,440
I wanted to do a comparison
before I send the car to my team.

364
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,960
So I'm just, you know, making changes now

365
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,600
and car dot what's left?

366
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,200
Engine color, door number, number.

367
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,400
Let's go with the number

368
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,520
38 and let's

369
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:06,560
find this car.

370
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:06,840
Okay.

371
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,840
Now, what I did, I had the belly button

372
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,680
and it showed me,
let's say, the blue car in front of me,

373
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:19,120
which has more doors, this particular
engine and blue color and the number 80.

374
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,880
And I visualized this also.

375
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:28,840
And I said, okay, looks pretty good,
but how about if I build

376
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,560
another car, which is green in color,
but I don't want to lose this one?

377
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:38,120
Also, I don't want to lose this blue car.

378
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,920
Also, maybe at the end I'll make
a decision that let's keep the blue car

379
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,360
and send it to the team that,
hey, this is the car that I built.

380
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,600
So what I can do, I can start this.

381
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,960
All right.

382
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,120
Okay.

383
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,920
Let's have a look first at the floor.

384
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,920
So these are the
changes now we made. Okay,

385
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,440
This blue changes

386
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,360
of the blue car.

387
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:11,360
Let's open up our terminal
and let's run the command jets.

388
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:21,360
Dash, dash and blue car.

389
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:26,800
Let's press enter.

390
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,680
So it's going to

391
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:33,120
pick up the blue car,

392
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:43,200
not picking it up,

393
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,880
and it's going to put it in this dash.

394
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,040
And what is going to happen to the working
directory?

395
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:58,840
How many guys what is going to happen
to this particular file?

396
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:03,000
It will bring back this file
to the same state

397
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,200
as in the latest coming latest coming.

398
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,240
So deliveries come because this particular
file, it's going to bring it back

399
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:16,200
and it's going to replace.

400
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:27,640
So let me open up my terminal
and there you.

401
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:27,960
Okay.

402
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:32,160
Now let's start building our next car,
which is going to be color.

403
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,400
So car door

404
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,960
color is equal to, let's say, green.

405
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,360
And my dot number is equal to

406
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,480
let's say

407
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,920
car door engine

408
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,840
is equal to

409
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,440
this one

410
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,280
on those links to please.

411
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:08,120
So this car has three doors

412
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,920
you'll be allowed to that.

413
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,280
Okay.

414
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,600
After making of this car,
I'm going to again

415
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,360
hit the play button
and I'll let you have a look at it.

416
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:31,680
Okay.

417
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,480
So the green car also looks good, but

418
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,480
I like the blue one.

419
00:28:39,480 --> 00:29:05,520
Now, what should I do?

420
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,440
Okay,

421
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,760
so first let's make the changes.

422
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,960
So this is the state of our working date
night.

423
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,240
We have that we got in here

424
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:16,760
right now.

425
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:22,080
We have a green guard in here.

426
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,640
I want this blue car back.

427
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:31,680
I don't like this green car.

428
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,600
Yes, I tell you.

429
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,960
All right, so what we are going to do,

430
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,040
we are going to start this one
and bring the blue one back.

431
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,800
This is what we are going to do.

432
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:47,720
So I'll open up my terminal, get dash

433
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:54,280
dashcam, green car.

434
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:55,720
Okay.

435
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,040
I have one question over here
for all of you.

436
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:07,160
Why don't I just delete the green car?

437
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,640
We might want it later. Yes. Perfect.

438
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,720
Good. Yes.

439
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,280
I'm not decisive enough.

440
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:18,600
My decision to change randomly,
you know, depends upon my luck.

441
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:22,320
It's been staff dash and green car.

442
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:22,680
Okay.

443
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,520
When I ran this command, it was picked up

444
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,280
and brought to this dash

445
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,600
for the standard two green.

446
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:33,880
Okay.

447
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,520
And what will happen

448
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,520
to my working directory?

449
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:51,080
What's going to happen in here?

450
00:30:51,080 --> 00:31:02,560
Yes, it will bring the file.

451
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,200
But the problem to this,

452
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:10,120
it will bring the file back
from the apple.

453
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:10,640
Okay.

454
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,520
So very good.

455
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:20,960
Now, what I want to do,
I want to bring this blue car here

456
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,280
in my

457
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,840
working directory.

458
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:32,160
I want to do this operation.

459
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:36,080
But before I actually do this,
I want to have a look at all

460
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,800
the items that I have in my stack.

461
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,360
How do we do that?

462
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:43,080
We have a matter for that. It's that

463
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:44,840
list.

464
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:49,560
Now. So I'm going to run this demand.

465
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:55,800
It's dash list.

466
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,520
So what do we see?

467
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,080
Red car, blue car,

468
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:06,760
green car.

469
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:10,560
And along with that
we see the numbers 210.

470
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,520
So basically it's like just a cylinder

471
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:18,840
in which we are placing the colors
and it's piling them

472
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:25,800
on one upon the other.

473
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,040
Okay.

474
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:29,200
Now I want to bring back
which number of index

475
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:33,000
do I want to bring back?

476
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,120
Yes, I'm sorry,
most indexing the blue one.

477
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,800
So what's the index of the blue one?
Let's have a look.

478
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,560
That's the one.

479
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,840
So I'll run the command,

480
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:48,360
get dash, apply one.

481
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,840
And what will happen?

482
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,800
It's going to

483
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,960
bring this particular dash into our work.

484
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,160
Exactly.

485
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,160
And it's also going to remain in there
in the stash.

486
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,080
It's not going to get deleted
from over there.

487
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,040
That is important.

488
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:05,720
Okay.

489
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:12,320
It's going to be in here also.

490
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,800
Okay. So now let's do this.

491
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,440
Yes, Dash,

492
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,760
apply one

493
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:50,000
very.

494
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,280
Okay.

495
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:54,240
So let me know what you guys
all have done to this point.

496
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,680
Any questions that we have asked me
and then we'll proceed

497
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,960
to show your terminology. Yes, sure.

498
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:09,320
There's my terminal.

499
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:13,960
Jimmy, that dash

500
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:19,280
that and red car.

501
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:24,200
Jimmy, you need to share the terminal
screenshot and share even the support.

502
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:31,160
There's going to be someone
who is going to help you out.

503
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,040
No, you're out.

504
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,520
There are no changes yet in the wrap.

505
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:40,200
Whatever is done is actually I tell you
what is happening behind the scenes.

506
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,960
I hear you on the visualization.

507
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:47,600
It's not exactly what happens,
but very close approximation to

508
00:34:47,600 --> 00:35:13,240
what is actually happening conceptually,
the message should be defined unique.

509
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,200
When we start.

510
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:20,440
Obviously, you will have to make sure that
you make those messages unique enough.

511
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,720
You can also,
I guess, have the same messages.

512
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:37,440
It's not going to be a problem.

513
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,760
I keep getting green

514
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,600
and that maybe

515
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:46,640
because Silva you are making the mistake
on the next thing.

516
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,440
Yes, it did.

517
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,200
You guys can see whether the changes
are being reflected

518
00:35:52,200 --> 00:36:15,440
right? Yes.

519
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,320
Silva, the problem obviously,
your problem is that when you ran

520
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,160
the command with static line,
you did not mention anything.

521
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,720
It it just went empty.

522
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,160
So it automatically
applied the green card.

523
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,120
And now you are trying
to apply out of this that.

524
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,240
It won't work like this.

525
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,320
Why assure you you understand that?

526
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:43,920
As we pointed out,
you have made some mistakes.

527
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,560
That's dash and green car.

528
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:47,560
Yeah.

529
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,240
When you sent it Silva to index change.

530
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:50,840
Right

531
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,800
then let's do change.

532
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,960
So you need to now

533
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,040
make sure that you are entering the right

534
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:04,200
index.

535
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:04,760
Okay, guys.

536
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,080
So let's proceed forward. I give you.

537
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,200
I think it's set up now.

538
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,760
Let's proceed forward.

539
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,000
Okay.

540
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,600
So after having this blue car, I had been
again chain might see certain that never.

541
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:23,800
I want direct contact look perfectly fine.

542
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,120
And next when you add another

543
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,000
staff and

544
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,800
this is going to decrease
increase of the like if it was two

545
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:36,320
it will become three.

546
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,640
Okay so I want the red card.

547
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:47,920
So what do you guys suggest I should do?

548
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:53,520
The first one is you.

549
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,800
Okay, so I'll have to again start the blue

550
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,040
and then get the red one.

551
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,880
So this is how it works, right?

552
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,520
No, I cannot do the bits stuff
at this point.

553
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,440
Let me show you this.

554
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:12,120
I tried to stress applied mustache
without that, this previous one,

555
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,440
it's going to give me an error.
Let me come

556
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,680
get stuff.

557
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:20,280
Let's not do this.
Let's. Let's have a loop.

558
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:20,840
Okay.

559
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:27,000
It has green card, blue car and red car.

560
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,040
Nice. Are you with me on this?

561
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,520
I really need your attention over here
because this is an important concept.

562
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:37,000
Okay, so I'll give you the brief again.

563
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:41,360
What I don't want to do right now is
I want the red car

564
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:45,920
in my working directly.

565
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,920
So what are we going to do?

566
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,840
First of all, we are going to do
is that we are not going

567
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:55,800
to start these changes
and use this command good stack of life.

568
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,640
So what do you think I should do?

569
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:02,440
Get stash apply

570
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,680
and what should be the number

571
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:08,600
index too?

572
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:14,880
It should be do because the red car
I want to recognize it should be do.

573
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,520
Okay.

574
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,520
So now before I run this,
I'm going to show you what will happen.

575
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,640
This is going to pick this one.

576
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,040
It's going to bring it in here.

577
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,360
And when it's going to say, okay,

578
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:30,000
I'm bringing in red car. But

579
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,640
when I took the red car, only

580
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,920
this new car was not here.

581
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,000
Instead,

582
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,400
it was at this table like empty.

583
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,240
It was actually

584
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,240
on the apple.

585
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:48,720
It was at this stage,
but now it has some other.

586
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,240
Cool. So what should I do?

587
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,680
I'm not going to allow you to do this.

588
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,960
So this is very intelligent.

589
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,840
It will say not. Oh no,

590
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,920
let's see.

591
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,680
Okay, so what do we see on here?

592
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,640
It says Your local changes
to the following files

593
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,920
will be overridden by the merge list.

594
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,720
Commit your changes
or stash them before you apply them.

595
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:17,040
So there is time that, hey,
I will not allow you to do this

596
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,440
either

597
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:24,040
commit the previous changes or stack them.

598
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,200
There's no other option.

599
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,480
So what do you suggest? What should we do?

600
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:34,440
We should ask them or commit them.

601
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,560
Sets them
because I don't want to commit it.

602
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,200
Right.

603
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:42,840
So simply I would say get that back and

604
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,440
you are to

605
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,120
assignment.

606
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,640
I'll I'll explain that.

607
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,600
Okay.

608
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:59,200
So we that's the blue car and
what will happen does this is interesting

609
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,040
that's going to pick up this new car

610
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:06,840
going to place

611
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:11,920
it in here.

612
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,000
Yes. Nicole.

613
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,080
And it will return the working directory

614
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:25,480
back to the state of the last commit.

615
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,720
Yes, ma'am.

616
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,480
Even though they are duplicate,
it is not going to take care for that.

617
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,920
It will say that. Okay, that's fine.

618
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,640
I'm going to create new stuff

619
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:41,240
that the same thing is going to happen.

620
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:51,360
Even if you do blue car. Yes.

621
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,400
And with no difference

622
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,440
because we are not decisive enough.

623
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:09,000
That's
why we are doing this to the process.

624
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,280
Okay, guys,
let me know when you're done on this one.

625
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:20,480
So then I will proceed.

626
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,480
Okay.

627
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,880
Now, if I open up my intelligent,

628
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,040
I would take this back to

629
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,560
where it was.

630
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,840
So I want the red car

631
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:37,880
here.

632
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,800
So but that I'll do

633
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,920
this dash

634
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,760
less because I don't remember this index.

635
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:58,240
It was So what is the index now?

636
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,080
Red car is on three sides.

637
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:08,840
It gets that applied three.

638
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:09,800
So there you go.

639
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:29,840
The red car is here in front of.

640
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:35,200
Okay, Now,
I haven't made up my mind and I say, okay,

641
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:39,000
this is the car that looks perfect
out of all the other cars.

642
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,880
And this one, I'm
going to send it in the commit

643
00:43:42,920 --> 00:44:12,840
so that it's finalized.

644
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,920
No, Simon, we cannot do it.

645
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,160
We have to smash it.

646
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:22,280
That's how stacking works.

647
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,400
So you made a mistake, right?

648
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,240
That's why
that's why you are getting the green more

649
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:30,600
coming, guys.

650
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,600
So I have made up my mind and I say that

651
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,640
I want this garden out
to be in the apple in the coming.

652
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:39,480
So what should I do?

653
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:44,080
Simply get at not

654
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,440
and then get come it

655
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,840
so let's make this come

656
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:04,080
get at dot

657
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:08,800
get comment dash
am and the message should be

658
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:14,360
the red car is ready for the trial

659
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,360
okay guys

660
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:33,520
so let me know
once you are done till this point.

661
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:37,120
And then we have a very interesting

662
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:38,680
I have

663
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,040
Angelica at the moment.

664
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,440
Your display could just have seemed
better.

665
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,280
Almost like if they are smaller,
they look exactly So

666
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,200
let us go ask them.

667
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,800
And they have not.

668
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:56,440
And good come.

669
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:42,400
It doesn't.

670
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,040
It's just testing stores the snapshot.

671
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:48,720
Okay, guys, I need your attention now.

672
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:51,600
I want you guys to read it for me.

673
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:55,800
Stashing
stores, the snapshot of your current file

674
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,840
changes in a separate container

675
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:03,240
and. Reverse the condition
of your working daily

676
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:04,480
to the

677
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:08,880
last comment.

678
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,040
Okay, so this is what we with witness
right now,

679
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:22,320
all of us.

680
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:37,680
Okay, great.

681
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,600
Get stuff

682
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:42,000
dashcam

683
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,840
message.

684
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:50,920
Just dash the changes

685
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,800
that you have made

686
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:57,720
and the next command that we have is

687
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,680
get attached to this.

688
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:06,320
The to view the changes,
to view the statues

689
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,320
and get

690
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,160
that applied

691
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,480
index

692
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:18,920
to apply

693
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:34,200
a certain steps.

694
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:56,760
Okay.

695
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:00,280
So this is an important lesson
that you like to discuss already.

696
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,840
If you have a statute applied

697
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,920
and you want to

698
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:15,440
apply any previous steps,

699
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:19,200
what do you do?

700
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:36,600
So I want you guys
to answer this question. No,

701
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:46,080
you must stash it first and then

702
00:49:47,280 --> 00:50:04,080
apply the previous steps.

703
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:20,400
Number two,

704
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,080
you can commit it or

705
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:26,640
and then apply the steps.

706
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:30,600
Okay, We have such a scenario.

707
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:32,160
Then we

708
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,600
can choose from the following
depending upon the scenario is number one.

709
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:39,160
Either we must dash it first
and then apply the previous dash.

710
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,040
We have discussed this.

711
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:44,400
Now you write,
we have discussed the scenario number one,

712
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,400
but we have not discussed
the scenario number two right now.

713
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:53,360
We will be discussing that now,
the group one adding those dash.

714
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:56,160
Yes, 13. Right. We'll keep on doing that.

715
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,400
Okay, guys, to this one,
everything that we have discussed,

716
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:07,440
is it clear to all of you, okay,

717
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:12,600
now we are diving into this scenario
number two.

718
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:16,200
I really want you guys to

719
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:19,280
draw out your hats
because this is something which,

720
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,520
if you understood,

721
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:24,240
it's going to make your life very,
very easy, as in for doing it.

722
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:28,200
Okay, so let's discuss

723
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,640
now. I
have made the command of the right car.

724
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:35,400
Right?

725
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:38,760
I've done that.

726
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:41,800
What is now, at this point

727
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:45,840
in time, my boss just called me

728
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,080
and he said, Hey, I don't like this car.

729
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,920
Send me the green one.

730
00:51:53,920 --> 00:52:05,680
Then what?

731
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,160
Well, my, you, we are an employer.

732
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:19,120
Okay, so that do the work.

733
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,560
Okay, so

734
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,280
I should sing that then.

735
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,760
In your stance,
Muhammad is saying start the game.

736
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:28,560
And one last thing you started
and get the car that he likes.

737
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:33,280
Okay, So tell me procedurally,
what is the first step that I should do?

738
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,560
We will do it on the simulation.

739
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,640
What should be my first step?

740
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:40,560
Let's come out of that run
at the first time.

741
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:41,400
Okay.

742
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:47,160
You guys are saying stuff this
so I get all these dashes.

743
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:49,720
Okay, so you guys are saying,
okay, do one more thing.

744
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:50,880
Start the red car.

745
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,280
Okay, So first,

746
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:58,320
let's go ahead with those people
who say starts the red car.

747
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:58,960
Okay.

748
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:02,880
Let's see that the first test,
the red car, it's going to pick it up.

749
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:06,240
It's going to place it in the

750
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,080
stacking area

751
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,760
and it's going to reverted back to the

752
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,760
red Will come in.

753
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:16,560
Right.

754
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:20,120
So it's not going to happen.

755
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:23,400
Let me show you that I do get stuff

756
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,680
that am

757
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,640
red car

758
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,480
that says no local changes to say

759
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,920
there you go it's not going to happen.

760
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:43,760
It's not going station.

761
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,840
Is that clear to all of you?

762
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:54,040
This concept.

763
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:56,560
Okay, so this
this is something we cannot do.

764
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:05,160
So what ordinary options.

765
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:08,120
Okay must apply saying apply
the new one directly.

766
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,160
Don't worry, man.

767
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:11,400
Just apply anymore whatever you want.

768
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:18,520
Okay, so are you going to do.

769
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:25,640
Let's discuss this scenario.

770
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,840
Let it go here

771
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:35,200
of not.

772
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:46,440
I get this.

773
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:46,800
Okay.

774
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:51,600
So I set things desolate
and have empty all the options.

775
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:56,480
No, I said that's not possible.

776
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:59,760
Okay, so the only option that we have,
let's discuss that.

777
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,760
The only option that we have is

778
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,440
to apply the staff directive.

779
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:07,920
We have no other option.

780
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,560
Okay, So let's have a look.

781
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:14,720
What will happen
if we apply the staff directly.

782
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:18,360
Okay, guys,
we are going to have a look at that.

783
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:19,480
But before we actually move

784
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:23,920
to the terminal and do that, first,
let's realize it conceptually.

785
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:28,560
So when I'm going to do stack, apply
this green one,

786
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:31,240
it's going to bring pick up
this green car.

787
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:34,440
Then to bring it in here

788
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:40,400
at this point is going to say, okay, now

789
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,560
I have

790
00:55:44,080 --> 00:56:01,520
a conflict.

791
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,400
We need to understand that.

792
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:05,760
Why is this conflict upgraded?

793
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:08,520
No, it's allowed,
but there will be a conflict.

794
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:09,600
And this is important.

795
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,160
All the conflicts,

796
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:15,200
you guys will be facing a lot of conflicts
and we'll be working on it.

797
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:16,880
And you should understand that.

798
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,840
Why the conflict occurs.

799
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:22,200
So I'm going to take you
now into the understanding

800
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:26,040
of when does a conflict actually occurs.

801
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:29,320
Okay.

802
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:35,280
So let's first discuss that,
how a conflict occurs.

803
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,640
So let me

804
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:41,640
create the files of

805
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:19,560
all of you guys.

806
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:20,720
Are you with me?

807
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,800
Everyone, please

808
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:27,240
leave everything you are doing
and just be absolute

809
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:53,040
concentration over here.

810
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:56,880
This is so
this was the code that was there in my

811
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,000
first Come in.

812
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:06,400
Remember, this is the code that we had

813
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,520
in our first time
that we made some changes

814
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:12,960
and we added a car,
let's say we added the red car

815
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:20,760
after that.

816
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:25,280
What we did with that direct car right,
we started.

817
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,480
So what is going to happen?

818
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:31,240
It's going to make the changes

819
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:37,600
and it's going to start them.

820
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:40,360
So it created another file
with the red car

821
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,400
and reverted

822
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:48,640
the condition of this

823
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:52,080
particular file to the one
which is the last coming

824
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:55,480
this this understood to everyone
that this is what happened.

825
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:58,800
We saw that for you. Right.

826
00:58:58,800 --> 00:58:59,640
Okay.

827
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:02,400
Now what what is one thing that we know

828
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:06,680
about it,

829
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:10,960
that it is very,
very vigilant about history.

830
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:12,680
Right.

831
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:15,800
So when get made the changes

832
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:18,800
that did it, remember

833
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:22,000
that what your file looked like it.

834
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,120
Remember that it had no lines

835
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,160
present on eight, nine, ten, 11.

836
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:30,160
And it knew that whenever you reapply

837
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:34,040
I just entered these line on the line
number eight, nine, ten, 11.

838
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:38,200
But remember that, okay, now what we did,

839
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:40,760
we made the green car

840
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:44,400
and we let's say green car,

841
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:48,320
some CC center here

842
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:49,920
before we made green.

843
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,080
And the number here like this.

844
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:57,720
Oh, we made the green car in this file
and then we started again.

845
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:01,080
So actually we brought these changes

846
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:05,880
and it created

847
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:11,440
another file.

848
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:15,720
Just remember that
when you start this particular stash

849
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:20,040
online, number eight, nine, ten, 11,
there was nothing.

850
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:23,520
And whenever you will restart it,
it will simply put these lines

851
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:26,760
on the respective line numbers.

852
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:34,840
Is that understood?

853
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:38,840
Okay, Now what we did,
we applied this particular

854
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:40,560
the red one

855
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:44,720
like this

856
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:49,200
and we made a comment of it.

857
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:50,760
This is what we did right.

858
01:00:50,760 --> 01:01:01,560
We made the comment of this car.

859
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:05,760
Now we are trying
to bring back our green car.

860
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:09,160
So when we will do the force applied

861
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,800
like this and the diagram

862
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:17,120
that we were discussing,

863
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:20,240
this is going to say, hey,

864
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:22,560
when you created this stuff

865
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:26,200
online, number eight, nine, ten, 11, 12,
there was nothing.

866
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:28,600
But now there is something.

867
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:31,920
I'm confused
what to do, where to let these lines

868
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:34,280
logical, right?

869
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:40,200
It makes sense.

870
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:43,720
So that's why a conflict
is going to arise.

871
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:48,120
There is a conflict
between dual codes that we have.

872
01:01:49,080 --> 01:02:11,040
Do you guys all understand that
why a conflict is occurring? Yes.

873
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:15,640
You have be done.

874
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:17,960
So that's the leader I got you for zero.

875
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:19,080
Okay.

876
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:23,880
I'm at the same that bleed the red car
in full and just simply statute again.

877
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:24,840
What do you guys think with it?

878
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:26,160
Would it work

879
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:28,840
if I believe that going forward statute

880
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:46,560
we are
going to try that, but not right now?

881
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:48,600
Exactly. We will not do it.

882
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:55,040
If it's a complex code, obviously,
we are not going to do it.

883
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:56,200
Yeah, we can delete the code.

884
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:58,680
But the problem is
that we already have that in the comment.

885
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:03,200
So give is not going to
maybe allow us to statute apply to static.

886
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:07,800
We see that there are changes
that we need to commit mustache.

887
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:08,680
Remember,

888
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:11,760
this is what's going to happen.

889
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:14,520
Okay. So now we are having a conflict.

890
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:17,400
Let's try to see that how it happens.

891
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:23,240
Get statute list.

892
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:23,520
Okay.

893
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:27,840
If I want to apply the green car,

894
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:33,720
what index am I going to use? Now?

895
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:36,040
Let's see. We cannot do that.

896
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:39,400
So get that applied.

897
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:49,000
One time.

898
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:55,360
But no one knows

899
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:58,720
that these line members are conflicting.

900
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,920
Decide which one do you want to keep

901
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:08,880
and look how intelligent it is.

902
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:10,560
This line was the input.

903
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:12,280
What good right

904
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:14,760
system talk out of the pendulum car.

905
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:16,280
What color this one thing.

906
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:17,400
So it said that okay,

907
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:21,400
this is the same for good
So you do not need to change this one.

908
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:32,280
Only the conflicts just changed them.

909
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:35,160
Okay,
we can read the message updated screen.

910
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:40,640
This one is the one that we had
in the comment and staff changes.

911
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:43,400
This is the one code
that we are applying from the start.

912
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:46,200
Now it's our decision.

913
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:48,440
Which code do you do we want to keep?

914
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:49,480
So what do you guys suggest?

915
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:53,120
Which code should I keep?

916
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:55,920
The green one.
So I am going to delete the previous one

917
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:01,760
and I'm going to keep

918
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:11,200
the green code.

919
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,560
So my green dot is there.

920
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:18,640
And if I show you on the simulation
that what will happen,

921
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:20,880
we must them to both of them.

922
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:24,800
And now

923
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:42,360
we created a new code.

924
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:45,400
Okay, now

925
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:49,560
get is going to ask us to commit
that I'll make these changes immediately.

926
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:52,800
This is not going to allow us
to do anything else to say that

927
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:53,880
okay, now permitted.

928
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:56,200
So what you can do is get add dog,

929
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:00,040
get commit

930
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:09,440
dash and here is your car.

931
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:11,440
Now, don't ask me to make sense

932
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:20,400
and we can literally put emojis in there.

933
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,720
Wow, that's awesome.

934
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:32,040
I so it's going to go in there

935
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:36,360
and then it's going to go

936
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:47,160
and I you comment. Yes.

937
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:49,680
Yes. That it

938
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,720
your guitar

939
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:06,240
says that
you do not get the conflict message.

940
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:08,320
What message did you get?

941
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:09,800
You'll be done. No message at all.

942
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:18,120
It allowed you to clarify that
that's not possible.

943
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:20,400
You must have skipped some steps.

944
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:25,960
Can you show me your eye
so you mean to say that it literally

945
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:28,440
allowed you and it like

946
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:31,880
showed me a and like,
how is that possible? Even

947
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:40,400
That's impossible.

948
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:42,880
Oh, okay.

949
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:45,600
So you'll be top.

950
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:47,800
That is because of the problem.

951
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:49,920
No, not the problem actually.

952
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:53,640
But that is
because when you were writing on the code,

953
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:59,160
your line numbers were not the exact same.

954
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:00,120
Okay?

955
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:03,400
That is because your line numbers
were not most probably

956
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:06,600
not same.

957
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:09,040
Yeah, that's why

958
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:15,160
so good actually works
on the line numbers.

959
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:21,560
Okay, so

960
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,240
get the member of the line number.

961
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:34,480
It remembers that.

962
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:37,360
Okay, let's have a look at the file.

963
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:39,920
If the members that online number seven

964
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:44,760
online the way this card dark color
is equal to read this

965
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:46,720
remember this

966
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:51,960
so when you are going to have another card
or color

967
01:08:52,040 --> 01:09:06,840
on the same line member, it's
going to give you a slip.

968
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:08,360
Mostafa I don't get that.

969
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:11,520
What is the code?

970
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:12,880
Okay. Decode Is that okay?

971
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:16,600
Rescue It will help you exit

972
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:21,000
guys.

973
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:24,680
So what's the status?

974
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:25,440
What's the status?

975
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:26,400
You guys with me?

976
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:29,880
All of you.

977
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:31,440
I hope you like

978
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:33,360
this.

979
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:36,320
Does is like starting or literally
very easy, right?

980
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:43,920
It's fun.

981
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:47,280
Okay, Suppose you have done many changes
and you lost

982
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:50,600
track of color was in the radical.

983
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:51,760
How can you find out

984
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:58,000
lack of color?

985
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:06,560
I mean, what do you mean
by track of color?

986
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:16,400
You forgot the car color
that was in the report.

987
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:20,400
Okay, so that means asking that
you made many changes and you do not know,

988
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:23,920
right now
that what is there in your apple.

989
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,160
So how can you do that?

990
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:27,720
Guys, if we want to review that,
what's in the report?

991
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:31,440
And we have done a lot of changes.

992
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:33,920
No, no, not less.

993
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,360
Okay. So maybe the same.

994
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:37,800
Let me give you the question
that might be the same,

995
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:42,520
maybe the same that we have made
many changes in our file

996
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:47,200
and we forgot that
What was the code in our last commit?

997
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:50,560
How can we have a
look at the code in an coming

998
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:56,960
good color code?

999
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:02,160
In the last name,
we can elect the word it from there.

1000
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:03,000
Apple right?

1001
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:14,240
By using get stuff.

1002
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:14,520
Okay.

1003
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:16,920
I think you guys did not get the question.

1004
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:25,720
Let me repeat the question.

1005
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:32,120
So nobody is saying that
this was our file, this one.

1006
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:33,000
Right.

1007
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:36,840
And we started working on it.

1008
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:37,800
We learned a lot.

1009
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:41,480
We made some a lot of changes

1010
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:45,040
and we forgot that, okay,
what are exclusivity looked like?

1011
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:48,080
And we want looked at how it looked like,
how it came

1012
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:52,720
do that.

1013
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:55,240
You guys get the question now

1014
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:00,520
get this bastard stage.

1015
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:00,920
Let's go.

1016
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:01,480
The difference.

1017
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:04,240
And one other method that I told you guys.

1018
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:05,720
What does that

1019
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:09,440
If you want to remove

1020
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:22,240
all the candies, what we can do.

1021
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:24,600
Okay, so let's do this.

1022
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:26,080
I mean, love you guys.

1023
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:27,640
I need your attention for this, okay?

1024
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:30,720
Because I got
you guys are not good enough.

1025
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:32,520
Okay, let's do this again.

1026
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:34,440
I'm going to repeat what can be last.

1027
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:38,480
Okay, So here is the question.

1028
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:43,120
Is everything in the Apple staging area
and the working directory, synchronize

1029
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:49,920
now. One day I woke up,

1030
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:57,360
I started making a lot of changes
in this file.

1031
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:02,040
After that, I said, Oh,
I forgot what my file looked like.

1032
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:04,920
I want to have a look at that.

1033
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:08,040
I'll simply start this file

1034
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:13,680
and this file is going to be recovered
from the report.

1035
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:21,040
Simple as that.

1036
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:25,080
I've a good.

1037
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:36,640
Okay, great.

1038
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:38,240
Yeah, I get that. I get that.

1039
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:41,880
That's why I said that you guys need
to pay attention to my question.

1040
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:43,880
Okay, So, um,

1041
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:48,840
so we put in the stack
and take the coupon get.

1042
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:50,560
Yeah, you can do that.

1043
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:51,960
How? Yes.

1044
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:56,760
I tried to of itself, guys,
I guess let's take a break.

1045
01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:57,320
Right.

1046
01:13:57,320 --> 01:14:01,880
It's 824 and Google is like,
I guess asking for break too.

1047
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:04,880
Let's go for a break right now.

1048
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:06,960
Let's refresh our mind and then we can

1049
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:09,880
begin from way.

1050
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:11,440
No, let's

1051
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:14,880
take a break right now.

1052
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:16,320
Minutes. This is 25.

1053
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:19,920
Let's meet at

1054
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:26,000
35, 48, 45 and see you guys at 830.

1055
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,480
And then we'll begin.

1056
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:29,760
Go and refresh ourself.

1057
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:34,040
Have a cup of water, coffee, tea,
whatever relaxes you, and then we can

1058
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:36,520
begin.

1059
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:40,520
From this point,
I know, don't have to do it.

1060
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:41,200
Don't do that.

1061
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:45,560
Alex, you need to attend the session.

1062
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:47,920
And my man obviously

1063
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:52,680
you cannot do that either.

1064
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:54,240
Yes, you can. Go ahead.

1065
01:14:54,240 --> 01:15:06,920
The first thing to notice

1066
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:17,120
is that hammer, you have five

1067
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:11,960
but most of the as the solution

1068
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:15,040
and you just make your friend mix it

1069
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:19,800
and you want to know

1070
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:22,960
that what's what was in there

1071
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:17,840
like you guys,

1072
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:21,840
I need a break
for some special purpose that's

1073
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:30,240
in my class at 840. So

1074
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:46,360
let's have a look at a logs quickly.

1075
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:51,960
So we have one, two, three.

1076
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:53,400
Come with me.

1077
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:57,440
Okay, so now what we are going to do,
we are going to discuss some use cases

1078
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:03,200
that you might face while you are work
regarding stash and how you can use them.

1079
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:06,720
And then moving on to some other examples

1080
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:10,000
of stashing and that will be it.

1081
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:15,360
Okay, so let's
imagine that you are working on a project

1082
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:21,800
and let's say

1083
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:30,240
let me open up my notes.

1084
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:32,880
You are working on a project

1085
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:39,080
and you immediately

1086
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:44,160
need to make some changes.

1087
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:45,600
And the

1088
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:51,960
board that, okay, so this is area
that you are working on a project

1089
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:55,000
and you immediately
need to make some changes in the code

1090
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:01,760
and send it to GitHub. But

1091
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:04,600
you have some

1092
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:09,120
on final list or the word non, maybe

1093
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:25,320
you're working on a project
and immediately

1094
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:28,800
you need to make some changes in the code
and send it to backup.

1095
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:32,880
But you have some non finalized changes
that you do not want to send.

1096
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:37,400
So what will you do?

1097
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:39,720
This is a use case where you can use DAS.

1098
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:43,320
You will start with changes and that which

1099
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:47,000
you do not want to make a commitment.

1100
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,400
Get ignore for hard come on and

1101
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:55,560
why don't you use give ignore

1102
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:07,120
to ignore the class?

1103
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:09,160
No you want

1104
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:11,480
look look good ignore is going to

1105
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:17,320
completely ignore that file
folder whatever is there

1106
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:20,680
and it's going to be very hectic
that you go again to that file

1107
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:23,160
and ignore it and ignore it.

1108
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:25,800
Okay,
so let's say let's take this example.

1109
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:29,640
Let's say that

1110
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:33,120
this is the final comment that we made

1111
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:35,400
and the goal is again, vanished.

1112
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:36,800
Okay, There we go.

1113
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,720
So this is the scenario right now.

1114
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:41,600
Okay.

1115
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:46,080
That's the scenario.

1116
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:49,520
What happened now
that I started working on another feature,

1117
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:54,360
I said that, okay,
the car is done and I can

1118
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:57,880
I can do
is I can simply create a new class and

1119
01:20:59,200 --> 01:20:59,800
have lives.

1120
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:06,160
I can start
working on headlights on the car.

1121
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:08,680
So I created a new file. This new class

1122
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:13,520
name headlights.

1123
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:21,720
I was following me.

1124
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:24,000
Okay, so we are discussing a scenario

1125
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:28,200
and we are beginning with create
creating a new class headlights.

1126
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:29,040
And you said that.

1127
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:31,240
Okay, let's start working on that.

1128
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:33,640
So I said spring power.

1129
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:36,240
Spring

1130
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:38,760
color and string.

1131
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:41,280
What else do we have?

1132
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:43,080
Signs maybe.

1133
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:47,200
Okay, while I was working on this class,
my teammate immediately

1134
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:48,400
called me and he said, Hey,

1135
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:52,760
just quickly, do some changes in your main

1136
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:56,840
could change the number to selling six
and send me the code.

1137
01:21:57,520 --> 01:22:06,120
Do I want to send him to headlights?

1138
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:08,400
No, because this is not something
finalized.

1139
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:10,520
I'm still working on it. Right.

1140
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:13,200
I don't want to send him this.

1141
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:15,120
And what I want to do is

1142
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:18,640
I just want to make this change
and send him the call.

1143
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:20,400
So what will I do?

1144
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:31,760
Guide me status.

1145
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:33,360
Okay, so I do. Good start.

1146
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:36,920
I'll make the change then

1147
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:45,520
after that, I'll make a commit.

1148
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:57,120
Right.

1149
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:59,400
Okay.
So these are the stuff that I'll follow.

1150
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:01,680
I'll mention that

1151
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:09,720
I would stash my changes.

1152
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:12,920
Number two, I will make the changes

1153
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:18,360
and the call that my read

1154
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:24,840
I will committed

1155
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:27,480
and send those changes

1156
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:31,480
in the GitHub.

1157
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:36,240
Now before I went up like the staff

1158
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:45,480
again,

1159
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:47,720
are these four steps still to everyone?

1160
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:51,000
Any questions?

1161
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:53,440
This is the procedure that we will be

1162
01:23:53,440 --> 01:24:04,640
following right.

1163
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:06,720
Okay.

1164
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:12,120
Now let's open up our simulation
and let's start working on that too.

1165
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:15,160
I would create a file over here
that's name it

1166
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:18,560
lights

1167
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:25,760
and it is going to be inside BSR.

1168
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:27,800
See, I wish I can.

1169
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:30,600
Okay, so this is inside. That's awesome.

1170
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:36,520
Just know that.

1171
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:41,760
Let me change the color to it.

1172
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:42,080
Okay.

1173
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:47,040
So what I need to do, I need to stash it.

1174
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:54,760
Then I can make changes over here
and then I can send the code.

1175
01:24:54,760 --> 01:25:00,600
Okay, So Mohammad is asking that, should
I start have like only my question to

1176
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:05,560
you guys is in get
can we make us specific stuff?

1177
01:25:07,320 --> 01:25:07,920
What do you think?

1178
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:10,400
Can you make a class specific stuff

1179
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:14,040
or something specific spec note
We cannot do that.

1180
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:15,680
If we stash, we stack all the key

1181
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:19,320
and just because I'm working on it, please
return to the last comment.

1182
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:20,760
That's a rule.

1183
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:25,520
That's how works.

1184
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:27,920
Okay, so let's do it and do this.

1185
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:31,200
Get stash

1186
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:37,240
diagram, analyze.

1187
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:38,400
What is this a thing?

1188
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:58,920
No local changes to see why that's.

1189
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:00,960
No, it's not about running the code.

1190
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:03,840
So here is a small thing
that I want to let you guys

1191
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:09,800
know.

1192
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:11,520
Get stash

1193
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:14,400
in order

1194
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:18,000
to work on untracked files

1195
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:22,320
need to be stashed

1196
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:24,960
using get stash

1197
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:27,920
stash. You

1198
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,880
okay, so

1199
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:49,760
I'll tell you why

1200
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:53,400
it is this little one,
this one, this statement.

1201
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:58,120
This is how it will work.

1202
01:26:58,120 --> 01:26:59,200
Okay, For those of you

1203
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:03,360
who's who gets working

1204
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:07,680
and you guys know, get status,
and if it's on track of track

1205
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:11,360
and I'm sure

1206
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:17,960
that you are tracking it.

1207
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:18,600
There you go.

1208
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:20,760
And the quote, you added it already.

1209
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:21,640
You are tracking it.

1210
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:22,920
That's what

1211
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:30,880
written.

1212
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:31,200
Right.

1213
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:33,600
But we did that
when you made our first dash.

1214
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:35,720
Yeah, but

1215
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:38,440
get status.

1216
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:39,680
That's right. Right now.

1217
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:41,760
Because this is a new class that we added.

1218
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:48,240
We are not tracking it yet.

1219
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:48,480
Okay.

1220
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,840
So if it does you asked you
you added it, right?

1221
01:27:52,680 --> 01:28:02,360
So it means you are tracking it. It.

1222
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:04,800
But those of you who added it,
I'm really sorry.

1223
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:06,240
It will not work for you.

1224
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:08,520
This is just something
that I wanted to show you guys.

1225
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:12,680
This is additional information
that if you want to stash

1226
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:18,280
and untracked file you need to use
get stats that you them are not for you.

1227
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:22,680
I'll come to that
I think that you just have

1228
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:28,640
another kind of problem.

1229
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:39,840
Okay so if I want to stash my file,
what will I do?

1230
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:43,200
Get stash that you

1231
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:48,960
okay so now I'd stash we've got See that

1232
01:28:49,440 --> 01:29:02,520
now it's not here.

1233
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:05,920
No, Jimmy,
they are saying they're exactly the same.

1234
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:18,920
They're not different.

1235
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:19,720
No return, right?

1236
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:23,760
You only use that when you are stashing
and untracked file.

1237
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:28,360
Okay.

1238
01:29:28,360 --> 01:29:34,680
Works.

1239
01:29:34,680 --> 01:29:36,000
Give me that, Mary.

1240
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:47,880
Because of the version of good
that you are, you have.

1241
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:50,960
Okay, you be time coming to that.

1242
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:51,720
Okay,

1243
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:54,960
so now listen

1244
01:29:55,240 --> 01:29:56,880
get to you.

1245
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:58,600
What is the purpose of using this stuff?

1246
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:01,720
You it is going to stash our unpacked
files.

1247
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:06,240
If we are not tracking any file,
then it cannot be stash

1248
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:08,160
by simply using get stash.

1249
01:30:08,160 --> 01:30:09,720
That's our

1250
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:16,920
get stash that is used to stash
those files, which we are tracking.

1251
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:18,720
Is that clear to all of you?

1252
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:24,280
You'll be that
does that answer your question.

1253
01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:24,640
Okay.

1254
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:28,360
Now coming to subconscious question
what will be the name?

1255
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:32,160
Okay, so now

1256
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:33,080
I don't know.

1257
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:35,440
But the good stash that you.

1258
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:39,240
I was unable to find how to put a message,
to be very honest with you.

1259
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:42,280
So if I assure you, it will automatically,

1260
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:49,320
automatically mimic.

1261
01:30:49,320 --> 01:31:00,360
So this saying yes,
that it created a stash of this one,

1262
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:05,280
I am going to show you
that in the simulation.

1263
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:05,600
Okay.

1264
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:08,880
So now when we did get stash that you

1265
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:12,640
this particular have came inside the stash

1266
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:16,240
and what happened to our working
that was a pre

1267
01:31:22,040 --> 01:31:24,120
what happened to our representative.

1268
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:28,240
It came back to the last time it

1269
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:29,400
for a fact.

1270
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:31,920
Now let's quickly make the changes

1271
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:36,120
let me change the number to edit seven.

1272
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:38,920
These are the changes that my

1273
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:41,320
you know in time

1274
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:44,760
we set to make out of the door floor

1275
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:50,280
and change the ending
to this and all the stuff

1276
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:55,800
Nicole I'll tell you that don't worry.

1277
01:31:56,920 --> 01:32:00,400
Okay guys we have made these changes
and now

1278
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:04,040
let me highlight
those changes with color yellow.

1279
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:08,440
Now we want to send this
changes to the repo.

1280
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:16,320
What should I do?

1281
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:18,720
Simply get that dot

1282
01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:20,680
and then make another comment right

1283
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:34,080
right.

1284
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:36,840
That's it.

1285
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:38,680
You want to send these changes, right?

1286
01:32:38,680 --> 01:32:42,200
You want to send these changes to our Lee.

1287
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:45,920
So why we should be stashing

1288
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:50,160
okay so get and dot get

1289
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:54,200
comment that him

1290
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:58,400
there are the changes

1291
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:01,680
that you asked me to make

1292
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:04,960
please make up your mind

1293
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:14,800
and please
do not make these kinds of comments

1294
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:24,400
that you are actually pushing
in Europe as a people.

1295
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:27,680
Now, I'm done with the changes
that you asked me and I want to, you know,

1296
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:34,680
start working on the feature
that I was working, which is headlines.

1297
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:37,680
So if I want to start
working on that feature,

1298
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:46,040
what will I do?

1299
01:33:46,040 --> 01:33:50,200
I'll see it in the list and then get stats

1300
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:53,120
list.

1301
01:33:53,680 --> 01:33:59,840
Okay, which is the one that I want.

1302
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:04,800
Okay, the index is zero right?

1303
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:07,960
So I simply do get that applied. Zero

1304
01:34:11,720 --> 01:34:12,120
does that

1305
01:34:12,120 --> 01:34:20,320
the one.

1306
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:23,280
Okay. I have one question over here.

1307
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:25,920
When I do this, will I have any conflict

1308
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:47,120
of the third thing yet?

1309
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:51,200
So maybe.

1310
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:54,000
But those different classes
for heart is also thing yet.

1311
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:57,000
So those of you who are saying yes,
what's the reason that you think

1312
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:02,640
there will be further conflict, Alex,
that we'll look at?

1313
01:35:02,640 --> 01:35:04,560
What's the reason for the passing?

1314
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:05,480
Do you guys see?

1315
01:35:05,480 --> 01:35:07,880
I mean, okay, so we made changes.

1316
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:08,960
So what

1317
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:14,280
get is going

1318
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:18,240
to try to apply this attachment
policy, apply

1319
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:20,800
It will try to apply it.

1320
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:22,760
Will it be in conflict

1321
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:29,680
with any other line of code?

1322
01:35:29,680 --> 01:35:32,760
Alex The question was there when I tried
to apply the statute, will there

1323
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:35,920
be any conflict?

1324
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:37,800
No, because.

1325
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:39,840
Right. No. What I'm trying to apply this.

1326
01:35:40,680 --> 01:35:44,280
It is not in conflict
with any line of code.

1327
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:47,640
It was all the code that we have,
it was a new class

1328
01:35:48,120 --> 01:35:51,480
and each test that complete whole class.

1329
01:35:51,480 --> 01:35:52,200
Right.

1330
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:54,000
So there will be no conflict.

1331
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,440
Let me show you this.

1332
01:35:56,440 --> 01:36:03,960
This dash apply zeal.

1333
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:04,520
There you

1334
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:13,080
start on.

1335
01:36:13,080 --> 01:36:15,240
You must have skipped something.

1336
01:36:15,240 --> 01:36:17,720
I cannot help you like this
without looking at the terminal.

1337
01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:19,360
Send it to the support.

1338
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:20,080
Maybe

1339
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:27,400
class
someone is going to have you help you.

1340
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:29,760
Yes. Now it's a lot of feedback.

1341
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:34,080
Okay, guys, so is this is this concept
you do all of you that way?

1342
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:38,520
Are we not having a positive right
now? Yes.

1343
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:42,840
You will do that.

1344
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:44,920
Okay. So two questions
which I have to answer.

1345
01:36:45,240 --> 01:36:47,360
The first one is

1346
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:50,840
what's the function of that hue?

1347
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:56,520
So in order to crack the in order
to stack the files,

1348
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:59,880
which we are not cracking,

1349
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:04,880
we cannot stack them by simply
get stash for that and use good stats.

1350
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:06,120
That hue

1351
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:09,840
nozzle is that we are now

1352
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:20,240
this that you

1353
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:22,680
that you stash untracked files

1354
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:26,080
the files which are we are not tracking.

1355
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:27,800
Okay so what are untracked files

1356
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:45,160
files that are not

1357
01:37:45,720 --> 01:37:48,800
in the staging area

1358
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:53,520
not crack

1359
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:55,360
by date

1360
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:06,120
appears and red.

1361
01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:08,760
Is this clear to everyone
that what are on files?

1362
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:11,240
Yes. And the working directory?

1363
01:38:11,240 --> 01:38:21,680
They are in the working directory. So.

1364
01:38:21,680 --> 01:38:25,000
And when I talk about crack

1365
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:29,600
files,

1366
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:59,240
what are they?

1367
01:38:59,240 --> 01:39:00,000
Right.

1368
01:39:00,360 --> 01:39:03,920
If you want to go back and unpack, file
with command,

1369
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:05,440
we have one that

1370
01:39:17,960 --> 01:39:19,080
if you want to crack.

1371
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:23,240
And on that unpack file,
which command do we have for that

1372
01:39:25,240 --> 01:39:26,400
stash?

1373
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:27,720
If you want to stash for hot.

1374
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:30,880
Not at up.

1375
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:32,280
Listen to the question again.

1376
01:39:32,280 --> 01:39:37,160
And which would be
if you want to stash and untracked file

1377
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:44,600
and okay, let's get stash.

1378
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:46,760
Yes but

1379
01:39:48,920 --> 01:40:07,040
and if you want to start a track file.

1380
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:10,000
Okay now now is is this due to everyone

1381
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:14,920
problem?

1382
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:15,720
Great.

1383
01:40:15,720 --> 01:40:33,520
Perfect.

1384
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:36,920
You'd give it to all of you
That where we can actually use

1385
01:40:36,920 --> 01:40:54,960
our session?

1386
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:56,040
This is one of the scenario.

1387
01:40:56,040 --> 01:41:00,320
And the other is you will see
as we proceed in the course

1388
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:03,320
and you guys be making use of it a lot.

1389
01:41:03,320 --> 01:41:06,800
When you will be working on your code,
you will see that you will immediately

1390
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:09,280
whatever you want to say,
that you are working on a project

1391
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:11,720
and you are like, okay,
I don't want school right now.

1392
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:13,480
Maybe I need to come back to it later.

1393
01:41:13,480 --> 01:41:14,840
You would just use that.

1394
01:41:14,840 --> 01:41:20,640
You know,
the purpose you use gift will get to you.

1395
01:41:20,640 --> 01:41:21,480
It's just like that.

1396
01:41:21,480 --> 01:41:23,840
If if you guys have, you know,

1397
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:28,920
$5 in your hand and you are in the dark,
so you just lit the fire doors.

1398
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:32,400
If you need to turn on the own,
you'll just live it.

1399
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,920
So if the fire torches there,
whenever there is

1400
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:39,400
that use gives you a little. Yes.

1401
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:41,040
You get to use this a lot.

1402
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:41,240
Okay.

1403
01:41:41,240 --> 01:41:44,760
So now we will be learning to get dash

1404
01:41:45,960 --> 01:41:47,760
other commands.

1405
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:51,000
So there are other commands which are

1406
01:41:51,160 --> 01:41:52,920
serving the same purpose,

1407
01:41:52,920 --> 01:41:56,600
but you should know it
if you are in future, you may need them.

1408
01:41:57,440 --> 01:41:58,640
Let's quickly them.

1409
01:41:58,640 --> 01:42:05,400
They are in simple.

1410
01:42:05,400 --> 01:42:08,720
So what If you want to delete a certain

1411
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:17,880
stash, find?

1412
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:21,000
Let's say
I want to leave the stash number for

1413
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:29,080
this stash

1414
01:42:29,080 --> 01:43:03,640
drop for this. You.

1415
01:43:03,640 --> 01:43:07,600
I don't know what to do that

1416
01:43:11,120 --> 01:43:22,560
or some

1417
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:28,080
other command that we have to

1418
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,400
apply to stash

1419
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:36,160
and then do need to automatically

1420
01:43:40,160 --> 01:43:41,280
close

1421
01:43:45,080 --> 01:43:45,920
nor general.

1422
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:47,640
How can you do that? You just need to.

1423
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:58,440
The stash is just gone so know we get it.

1424
01:43:58,440 --> 01:43:58,800
Okay.

1425
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:00,840
If you want to fly to stash and delete it

1426
01:44:02,360 --> 01:44:03,960
automatically,

1427
01:44:04,600 --> 01:44:06,560
how can you do that?

1428
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:07,680
That's good.

1429
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:10,320
Stash list

1430
01:44:12,240 --> 01:44:14,080
and the

1431
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:17,400
command for that is good

1432
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:19,520
stash.

1433
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:25,080
But index number, that's a good stash.

1434
01:44:25,080 --> 01:44:27,520
Bob Zero is going to apply that and we

1435
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:34,040
so if I do get that list right now

1436
01:44:34,920 --> 01:44:39,680
we do not see you see why do you see that?

1437
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:41,280
Okay this is already up a bit.

1438
01:44:41,280 --> 01:44:43,360
Okay. Could not give me an error.

1439
01:44:44,520 --> 01:44:45,240
Okay.

1440
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:47,560
Well, at this time

1441
01:44:47,560 --> 01:44:51,440
I think we cannot apply a particular stack
because it's going to give us an error.

1442
01:44:51,640 --> 01:44:54,920
So let's not do that or let's do
another test.

1443
01:44:55,320 --> 01:44:58,160
Let's try to drop the third one

1444
01:44:59,200 --> 01:45:01,120
for pre

1445
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:05,520
and then do this

1446
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:09,360
task list.

1447
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:14,760
No, it dogs us going to.

1448
01:45:14,760 --> 01:45:15,000
Okay.

1449
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:18,240
Well the purpose is that it does work so

1450
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:20,520
right now good stash pop

1451
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:26,360
index it's going to apply and needed
right now you are unable to do that

1452
01:45:26,360 --> 01:45:28,800
because we have some conflicts going on

1453
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:36,600
and let's not deal with them.

1454
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:40,120
Okay? Okay.

1455
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:44,480
So the questions
while index you have w IP on master,

1456
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:48,400
let's dash through list we

1457
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:55,360
okay because I did not pleased message
while stashing this

1458
01:45:55,840 --> 01:45:59,480
so it automatically placed message
to remember.

1459
01:45:59,720 --> 01:46:02,200
Okay so this is an auto generated message.

1460
01:46:02,200 --> 01:46:09,200
If you do not put in the message,
it will just put it by itself.

1461
01:46:09,200 --> 01:46:09,920
Okay.

1462
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:13,560
But some there must be saved
after we drop into these interrupt

1463
01:46:13,560 --> 01:46:15,320
to accomplish something.
That's actually the purpose.

1464
01:46:15,320 --> 01:46:16,880
Okay. Okay.

1465
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:19,600
So how like we're saying that after
we have dropped a stash,

1466
01:46:20,720 --> 01:46:23,440
it must be saved somewhere as
What's the purpose?

1467
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:24,280
Okay,

1468
01:46:25,080 --> 01:46:28,360
so in order to answer that

1469
01:46:28,360 --> 01:46:32,160
slashing is your temporary saving area.

1470
01:46:33,120 --> 01:46:36,600
If you want to save it, even after
you drop it, you have the grapple

1471
01:46:38,040 --> 01:46:39,520
and the stacking area.

1472
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:40,760
Whatever goes once.

1473
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:43,120
If you drop it, it's deleted. It's
nowhere.

1474
01:46:43,200 --> 01:46:44,560
There's no way you can recover it.

1475
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:46,480
It's a very temporary story's.

1476
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:51,480
Got it. So

1477
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,560
okay, guys,
So I be good with the stashing stuff.

1478
01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:59,560
Should I move forward? Oh,

1479
01:47:04,120 --> 01:47:04,320
okay.

1480
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:08,160
Okay, great.

1481
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:11,440
So a lot of

1482
01:47:12,600 --> 01:47:14,880
stuff over here.

1483
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:17,480
Let's close that

1484
01:47:17,480 --> 01:47:21,000
and let me see
if we can do another example

1485
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:25,320
that I may have. So,

1486
01:47:27,680 --> 01:47:30,600
no, I guess that's it for session.

1487
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:33,040
Oh, you guys, let's close our project

1488
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:42,480
and let's do one thing.

1489
01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:45,560
Where is our terminal
or I close my terminal also.

1490
01:47:47,040 --> 01:47:50,320
Let's open the terminal, regains

1491
01:47:51,320 --> 01:47:52,760
that log.

1492
01:47:53,320 --> 01:47:54,640
Yeah, okay. It's.

1493
01:47:54,640 --> 01:47:56,040
It is there.

1494
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:59,480
Let's just go to our GitHub

1495
01:48:00,160 --> 01:48:04,400
and we do that.

1496
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:05,720
Okay, let's send it to GitHub.

1497
01:48:05,720 --> 01:48:09,120
So I'll open up my GitHub account
and I'll quickly

1498
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:14,600
create a new repository
just like we did yesterday.

1499
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:18,360
And I want to ask you guys, will
I need to create a new wrapper for this

1500
01:48:18,360 --> 01:48:23,880
or can I use a previous wrapper?

1501
01:48:23,880 --> 01:48:25,920
I don't have to create a new one, right?

1502
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:28,320
So I create a new apple. Limit

1503
01:48:29,360 --> 01:48:33,640
that car, create

1504
01:48:34,200 --> 01:48:43,040
a positive free.

1505
01:48:43,040 --> 01:48:44,560
Okay, so what's the first step?

1506
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:46,920
What I want to

1507
01:48:48,200 --> 01:48:49,720
send my code to the GitHub.

1508
01:48:49,720 --> 01:48:52,120
What's the very first step

1509
01:48:57,480 --> 01:48:59,120
would be

1510
01:48:59,480 --> 01:49:01,760
to make sure that I'm in the right right
location.

1511
01:49:01,760 --> 01:49:05,440
Yes, I am.

1512
01:49:05,440 --> 01:49:07,440
I'm in the right position.

1513
01:49:08,200 --> 01:49:09,520
What's next?

1514
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:13,920
What should be our next step?

1515
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:14,240
Okay.

1516
01:49:14,360 --> 01:49:17,520
Me, I already have this apple bagel.

1517
01:49:17,960 --> 01:49:20,520
I have this wrapper

1518
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:22,160
already right?

1519
01:49:22,160 --> 01:49:24,760
So I do not need to initialize it.

1520
01:49:24,760 --> 01:49:27,120
I need to initialize the connection
between the remote wrapper

1521
01:49:27,120 --> 01:49:29,280
that I created with my local.
That was before.

1522
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:34,560
That gives me more add origin.

1523
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:35,720
Let's name it.

1524
01:49:35,720 --> 01:49:41,280
The url is here.

1525
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:43,960
Is that right?

1526
01:49:44,120 --> 01:49:50,120
What's the next command?

1527
01:49:50,120 --> 01:49:52,800
Dead branch, Dash and main.

1528
01:49:54,400 --> 01:49:57,360
And then what should I do

1529
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:07,440
that push that new origin Me

1530
01:50:12,640 --> 01:50:12,840
Okay,

1531
01:50:12,840 --> 01:50:15,720
so everything
that I have is sent to my apple.

1532
01:50:15,960 --> 01:50:19,160
I can show you that over here.

1533
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:20,480
Oh, it's there.

1534
01:50:20,480 --> 01:50:22,600
The number of commits were four.

1535
01:50:22,600 --> 01:50:33,760
They are there.

1536
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:34,800
Okay, take your time.

1537
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:36,920
Take 2 minutes till 915.

1538
01:50:37,200 --> 01:50:39,520
Push up, goes to your apple
and let me know.

1539
01:50:40,840 --> 01:50:44,880
And then we'll move forward.

1540
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:48,320
Oh, well, you can do that. But

1541
01:50:49,400 --> 01:50:52,760
it's it's important
that you remember the command.

1542
01:50:52,760 --> 01:50:55,440
So make it a habit to type it.

1543
01:50:56,800 --> 01:50:57,640
Okay?

1544
01:50:57,880 --> 01:50:58,680
Yeah.

1545
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:01,920
You dive in,
but you told them it's a copy.

1546
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:05,720
Well, we have someone files know

1547
01:51:06,400 --> 01:51:10,480
which files are on track.

1548
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:26,040
Yes, I showed that minutes ago
because of the comments.

1549
01:51:26,040 --> 01:51:28,320
Okay, so we have them on fact files.

1550
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:32,040
Okay, let's do one.

1551
01:51:32,200 --> 01:51:34,120
Okay, let's come back now.

1552
01:51:34,120 --> 01:51:36,000
Get add dot.

1553
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
Good. Come and dash and

1554
01:51:39,320 --> 01:51:40,880
latest

1555
01:51:41,240 --> 01:51:43,320
final comment

1556
01:51:44,720 --> 01:51:46,560
get push

1557
01:51:47,640 --> 01:51:51,080
So make sure that if you haven't
put files add them to

1558
01:51:51,480 --> 01:51:53,880
and just make a push with the command

1559
01:51:54,240 --> 01:52:00,120
latest file come it.

1560
01:52:00,120 --> 01:52:04,040
Well that's because your dog did
ignore file

1561
01:52:04,080 --> 01:52:07,120
must not have the correct info

1562
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:20,080
or as now

1563
01:52:20,080 --> 01:52:26,280
we all have the same called right.

1564
01:52:26,280 --> 01:52:26,560
Okay.

1565
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:30,120
So after the class
you do not have to put in the space.

1566
01:52:30,120 --> 01:52:33,680
I suggest you have the dot and the slash.

1567
01:52:33,680 --> 01:52:35,040
Make sure that there is no space.

1568
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:40,680
And apart from that,
make sure that you are saving.

1569
01:52:40,680 --> 01:52:42,760
Okay, guys, I'm done. To this point.

1570
01:52:43,080 --> 01:52:47,240
All of us.

1571
01:52:47,240 --> 01:52:48,800
I'm pretty sure that's good luck.

1572
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:52,480
Different colors.

1573
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:52,840
Dennis.

1574
01:52:52,840 --> 01:52:57,720
I'm not sure about what you are asking.

1575
01:52:57,720 --> 01:53:00,360
And GitHub. Yes,
we can do that. I'll I'll teach you

1576
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:03,480
this.

1577
01:53:03,480 --> 01:53:07,680
Not focus on that right now.

1578
01:53:07,680 --> 01:53:08,240
Okay, guys.

1579
01:53:08,240 --> 01:53:11,440
So let's now refresh

1580
01:53:11,440 --> 01:53:14,520
our GitHub.

1581
01:53:14,520 --> 01:53:16,480
There are five number of commands.

1582
01:53:16,480 --> 01:53:18,880
Fine. Good enough.

1583
01:53:19,200 --> 01:53:22,160
Now for those of you

1584
01:53:22,680 --> 01:53:25,480
who do not have this good

1585
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:31,080
on the GitHub right now, is there anyone
who doesn't have this code on GitHub?

1586
01:53:31,680 --> 01:53:32,840
Let me know

1587
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:36,440
because I need to then

1588
01:53:36,440 --> 01:53:41,160
see what I can do for you.

1589
01:53:41,160 --> 01:53:48,680
But they all of you are not.

1590
01:53:48,680 --> 01:53:52,120
Okay, great.

1591
01:53:52,120 --> 01:54:04,320
So, so

1592
01:54:07,440 --> 01:54:08,960
yeah, that's fine. Jim.

1593
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:10,320
No worries

1594
01:54:30,240 --> 01:54:31,960
and I'll come to that.

1595
01:54:31,960 --> 01:54:33,160
Don't worry.

1596
01:54:34,080 --> 01:54:35,880
I can click on my commands.

1597
01:54:35,880 --> 01:54:38,640
I can show you. I'll show you that.
Just great.

1598
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:47,160
Okay, right now we have another topic.

1599
01:54:47,160 --> 01:54:47,880
Don't worry, guys.

1600
01:54:47,880 --> 01:54:51,800
I'll teach you everything about GitHub.

1601
01:54:51,800 --> 01:54:54,800
The next two classes all on GitHub.

1602
01:54:55,320 --> 01:54:55,840
Okay,

1603
01:54:56,880 --> 01:54:59,560
so now the first step that we have is

1604
01:55:01,440 --> 01:55:02,600
to clone the problem.

1605
01:55:02,600 --> 01:55:06,160
But before we do that,
we are going to go into a scenario.

1606
01:55:07,320 --> 01:55:09,800
Let's assume that right now

1607
01:55:10,160 --> 01:55:14,080
I'm a person is work
who is supposed to work on a project.

1608
01:55:14,080 --> 01:55:18,600
I just joined into a company
and they are working on cars

1609
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:22,280
and they build awesome cars

1610
01:55:22,760 --> 01:55:24,000
and along with me

1611
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:27,600
another person doing it
that is a clone of me.

1612
01:55:27,600 --> 01:55:31,160
So this is me, number one,
and that is the mean number two.

1613
01:55:31,960 --> 01:55:34,320
I'm sorry, he's not available right now.

1614
01:55:34,360 --> 01:55:37,440
Maybe I've been in office some time, but

1615
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:40,560
you guys do get the idea right?

1616
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:44,000
So two people just joining the company
and the both are supposed

1617
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:47,760
to work on the same project
and which is building the cars.

1618
01:55:48,840 --> 01:55:52,320
So let's go ahead and join in.

1619
01:55:52,320 --> 01:55:54,480
And I said, okay,

1620
01:55:54,560 --> 01:56:00,400
hey, my team, can you please share the
GitHub grapple on which I want to work on?

1621
01:56:00,400 --> 01:56:01,720
I'm supposed to work.

1622
01:56:01,720 --> 01:56:03,320
You'll say, why not?

1623
01:56:03,320 --> 01:56:06,200
Here is fueling will give me this

1624
01:56:06,200 --> 01:56:11,040
link.

1625
01:56:11,040 --> 01:56:14,520
I'll say, okay, I've got really

1626
01:56:14,840 --> 01:56:17,880
I'll go to my desktop,
I'll see this is the location

1627
01:56:17,880 --> 01:56:20,120
where I want to place my project

1628
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:23,680
car company

1629
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:30,920
project.

1630
01:56:30,920 --> 01:56:32,840
I'll open this up.

1631
01:56:33,440 --> 01:56:35,440
I'll open the get back here.

1632
01:56:35,440 --> 01:56:43,440
So should I download the code
or should I cloning it?

1633
01:56:43,440 --> 01:56:45,480
Okay, why should I want it?

1634
01:56:45,480 --> 01:56:50,360
Why not download?

1635
01:56:50,360 --> 01:56:52,800
Because I want to have all this history.

1636
01:56:53,880 --> 01:56:59,040
That's why.

1637
01:56:59,040 --> 01:57:04,080
So I'd say get clone
and then I'll give the

1638
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:07,800
address.

1639
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,520
So. Okay, so it's done

1640
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:15,120
of you guys.

1641
01:57:15,120 --> 01:57:18,600
Now what I want to do is
I want to go to the logs

1642
01:57:18,600 --> 01:57:21,520
and I want to view their previous commit.

1643
01:57:21,680 --> 01:57:44,560
How can do that?

1644
01:57:44,560 --> 01:58:00,160
Why is this error here?

1645
01:58:00,160 --> 01:58:02,880
I'm going to catch it
some someone must catch it.

1646
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:04,200
I'm pretty sure that you will

1647
01:58:05,400 --> 01:58:10,440
know how it documents and like that.

1648
01:58:10,440 --> 01:58:12,600
I'm sure you guys
will be able to catch it.

1649
01:58:12,600 --> 01:58:15,880
What's the matter?

1650
01:58:15,880 --> 01:58:16,360
Very good.

1651
01:58:16,360 --> 01:58:18,040
And I'm not in the right. Cool.

1652
01:58:18,040 --> 01:58:19,640
And I did that on purpose

1653
01:58:19,640 --> 01:58:23,280
because I know that a lot of you
will be making this mistake like this one.

1654
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:29,160
Trust me, you guys will do this mistake.

1655
01:58:29,160 --> 01:58:31,880
So let's make sure
that you are in the right folder.

1656
01:58:32,120 --> 01:58:35,240
Okay?

1657
01:58:35,240 --> 01:58:38,720
No, I was just making sure that I let
you know that.

1658
01:58:38,720 --> 01:58:40,920
What's the error

1659
01:58:41,080 --> 01:58:44,600
at the city

1660
01:58:44,640 --> 01:58:46,000
gate car

1661
01:58:46,400 --> 01:58:51,680
And now get locked.

1662
01:58:51,680 --> 01:58:54,720
Okay,
so here are all the permits that we have.

1663
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:56,720
The final commit

1664
01:58:58,320 --> 01:59:01,440
American goes.

1665
01:59:01,440 --> 01:59:03,560
I don't like this new entry of the

1666
01:59:04,600 --> 01:59:07,640
With that now you have no clue.

1667
01:59:09,520 --> 01:59:10,080
Okay guys.

1668
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:12,320
So at this point
I want you to tell me one thing.

1669
01:59:12,320 --> 01:59:14,520
I see that hard hat is on the me.

1670
01:59:15,760 --> 01:59:17,920
What does this show me

1671
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:29,920
and what does this

1672
01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:35,440
origin slash mean?

1673
01:59:35,440 --> 01:59:35,920
That's

1674
01:59:43,040 --> 01:59:43,320
okay.

1675
01:59:43,320 --> 01:59:48,640
So this particular one Origin slash
mean is actually showing us that two

1676
01:59:48,640 --> 01:59:52,440
which come commit our GitHub
repo and a local repo

1677
01:59:52,440 --> 01:59:55,480
are synchronized

1678
01:59:59,640 --> 02:00:02,280
so f origins
last man is the building over here.

1679
02:00:02,280 --> 02:00:06,120
It means that this commit is not present
in B remote grapple

1680
02:00:07,440 --> 02:00:11,920
now or slash me that had asked me
are at the same location.

1681
02:00:12,360 --> 02:00:15,000
It means that they both are synchronized

1682
02:00:17,200 --> 02:00:20,720
in fact in fact let me add something here

1683
02:00:21,320 --> 02:00:23,920
I just like mean and origin had

1684
02:00:26,720 --> 02:00:28,080
these two are

1685
02:00:28,080 --> 02:00:32,800
most probably should be the one
we should be synchronized attachment slash

1686
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:35,960
we can be synchronized because it may be

1687
02:00:35,960 --> 02:00:38,120
pointing towards some other commit in the

1688
02:00:39,480 --> 02:00:42,280
the previous commit indirectly
we can do that.

1689
02:00:42,560 --> 02:00:48,920
We can have it move downwards.

1690
02:00:48,920 --> 02:00:49,200
Okay.

1691
02:00:49,200 --> 02:00:55,040
How much what do you ask?

1692
02:00:55,040 --> 02:01:01,120
How did I do what?

1693
02:01:01,120 --> 02:01:03,520
How did you fix on the wrong folder?

1694
02:01:03,520 --> 02:01:06,840
I simply did D and then I moved into that

1695
02:01:06,840 --> 02:01:10,800
folder of which I actually wanted to move.

1696
02:01:10,800 --> 02:01:21,680
And that's how I fix it. Yes.

1697
02:01:21,680 --> 02:01:26,760
You guys are following. Yes.

1698
02:01:26,920 --> 02:01:28,760
At all that. I hope

1699
02:01:31,080 --> 02:01:31,560
for you guys.

1700
02:01:31,560 --> 02:01:35,440
So this
one, any questions that can be have

1701
02:01:46,680 --> 02:01:56,040
have you all good?

1702
02:01:56,040 --> 02:01:56,280
Okay.

1703
02:01:56,280 --> 02:02:07,320
I will meet all of you.

1704
02:02:07,320 --> 02:02:07,600
Okay.

1705
02:02:07,600 --> 02:02:11,520
So now we only have 25 minutes left

1706
02:02:13,080 --> 02:02:15,720
and I really want to explain to you

1707
02:02:15,720 --> 02:02:18,720
how it works.

1708
02:02:18,840 --> 02:02:21,000
Yes, I'm doing that.

1709
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,720
I want to explain you
how good get pool and good

1710
02:02:23,760 --> 02:02:27,680
fetch works and better.

1711
02:02:27,680 --> 02:02:28,520
For that.

1712
02:02:28,520 --> 02:02:33,040
I need one small saver from all of you.

1713
02:02:33,040 --> 02:02:37,680
And that is going to be to just stop doing

1714
02:02:38,040 --> 02:02:40,800
everything that you are
and just focus here.

1715
02:02:41,480 --> 02:02:44,120
I don't want you to follow me on whatever

1716
02:02:45,040 --> 02:02:47,200
the concept is important.

1717
02:02:47,200 --> 02:02:50,160
Doing that
cool stuff is just running one come that

1718
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:55,160
code and that's it.

1719
02:02:55,160 --> 02:02:58,960
So I believe that all of you can run
that you will be able to,

1720
02:02:59,760 --> 02:03:02,080
but if you understand the concept,

1721
02:03:03,480 --> 02:03:07,000
then that is going to be

1722
02:03:07,520 --> 02:03:10,320
the core purpose of everything.

1723
02:03:10,920 --> 02:03:14,400
Okay, It might get a little bit

1724
02:03:14,640 --> 02:03:17,760
tricky because I will be pretending
to be two users.

1725
02:03:17,760 --> 02:03:21,920
That's why I really don't want anyone
to be doing anything.

1726
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:25,520
I promise that it will be really easy
to pay attention.

1727
02:03:26,880 --> 02:03:29,400
Okay, so I am the user one

1728
02:03:30,440 --> 02:03:34,200
who just joining the company
and I've flown the project

1729
02:03:36,160 --> 02:03:43,160
on. So

1730
02:03:44,680 --> 02:03:46,520
now here is a pool of me.

1731
02:03:46,520 --> 02:03:49,200
User two
He also want to work on the project.

1732
02:03:49,200 --> 02:03:50,840
What will he do?

1733
02:03:51,120 --> 02:03:59,400
So he was also floated, right?

1734
02:03:59,920 --> 02:04:06,000
So I went to create a folder I limit car.

1735
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:07,240
So let's limit.

1736
02:04:07,240 --> 02:04:10,840
That's why we call

1737
02:04:11,480 --> 02:04:13,600
Capital One to open it.

1738
02:04:13,840 --> 02:04:18,840
I'm going to open up the pit bash
and I'm going to say good color on

1739
02:04:20,120 --> 02:04:20,640
the same

1740
02:04:20,640 --> 02:04:35,440
record, and then

1741
02:04:35,440 --> 02:04:43,120
I'm going to the pool under Stevie log.

1742
02:04:43,120 --> 02:04:46,920
It shows me all the permits

1743
02:04:46,920 --> 02:04:50,120
that are there.

1744
02:04:50,120 --> 02:04:54,320
Okay,
So now I'm so this one, any confidence

1745
02:04:54,320 --> 02:04:56,760
that you guys may have

1746
02:05:12,440 --> 02:05:14,040
remember that this one is user one

1747
02:05:14,040 --> 02:05:27,800
and this one is user two.

1748
02:05:27,800 --> 02:05:51,720
Okay, this is our app on GitHub.

1749
02:05:52,440 --> 02:05:55,360
I'm going to be having the

1750
02:06:05,320 --> 02:06:05,880
we have five

1751
02:06:05,880 --> 02:06:16,200
committees.

1752
02:06:16,200 --> 02:06:19,000
One, two, three, four, five.

1753
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:20,800
Okay.

1754
02:06:20,800 --> 02:06:22,960
So five permits are here.

1755
02:06:23,080 --> 02:06:25,520
So I cloned this represent pre

1756
02:06:26,280 --> 02:06:28,800
as we use a one

1757
02:06:32,760 --> 02:06:34,040
and I cloned this proposal

1758
02:06:34,040 --> 02:06:37,080
three have been use it two

1759
02:06:37,320 --> 02:06:38,560
on separate system

1760
02:06:38,560 --> 02:06:41,520
let's just as you point out

1761
02:06:48,800 --> 02:06:50,480
so the exact same wrapper

1762
02:06:50,480 --> 02:06:52,520
will be built right

1763
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,520
and similarly for my this user

1764
02:07:28,400 --> 02:08:06,600
search. Okay

1765
02:08:07,640 --> 02:08:12,040
now is this concept to all of you
that GitHub on GitHub, I had the Google

1766
02:08:12,040 --> 02:08:13,560
two users joined the company

1767
02:08:13,560 --> 02:08:16,880
and they both known them
on this separate computer system.

1768
02:08:18,160 --> 02:08:21,560
They both
have the access to this particular apple.

1769
02:08:21,560 --> 02:08:23,520
Otherwise
they will not be able to work on this.

1770
02:08:23,520 --> 02:08:27,960
They are invited to collaborate on that.

1771
02:08:27,960 --> 02:08:30,680
Is this also due to all of you?

1772
02:08:30,680 --> 02:08:32,080
I cannot work on this network.

1773
02:08:32,080 --> 02:08:34,800
I'm not invited. I was invited.
How do we do that?

1774
02:08:34,800 --> 02:08:36,520
I'll let you know. But not right now.

1775
02:08:36,520 --> 02:08:38,960
Let's assume that I was invited.

1776
02:08:38,960 --> 02:08:39,680
Okay,

1777
02:08:40,680 --> 02:08:44,160
so now let's do one.

1778
02:08:44,160 --> 02:08:49,640
So let's pretend to be user one right now.

1779
02:08:50,160 --> 02:08:53,440
I opened up this gift card project
and I said that.

1780
02:08:53,440 --> 02:08:59,080
Okay, I'm going to the board now.

1781
02:08:59,080 --> 02:09:01,600
Let's create

1782
02:09:01,600 --> 02:09:03,040
a new file.

1783
02:09:03,040 --> 02:09:05,120
Let's name it

1784
02:09:09,280 --> 02:09:13,680
my features or let's say

1785
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,680
my features user one

1786
02:09:20,160 --> 02:09:22,320
Now that I'm in here,

1787
02:09:22,320 --> 02:09:28,160
the I'm adding some features.

1788
02:09:28,160 --> 02:09:32,600
So what we did, we just simply created
a file inside the project.

1789
02:09:33,880 --> 02:09:34,800
I named it

1790
02:09:34,800 --> 02:09:37,680
my features user want and added
some text deliver.

1791
02:09:38,080 --> 02:09:40,080
Is that well one

1792
02:09:45,480 --> 02:09:46,600
simple, right?

1793
02:09:46,600 --> 02:09:48,720
Nothing complicated.
Just we have new files.

1794
02:09:48,760 --> 02:09:51,920
That's it. Now

1795
02:09:54,480 --> 02:09:56,160
this file being cracked right

1796
02:09:56,160 --> 02:10:00,080
now. No,

1797
02:10:01,560 --> 02:10:02,760
Let's see.

1798
02:10:02,920 --> 02:10:05,400
This is an important feature,
and I want to,

1799
02:10:05,640 --> 02:10:08,520
you know, just push it to get up.

1800
02:10:08,520 --> 02:10:15,600
So what should I do?

1801
02:10:15,600 --> 02:10:18,640
It? Add dot click, comment,

1802
02:10:19,560 --> 02:10:23,640
dash cam user

1803
02:10:25,600 --> 02:10:31,400
features added by the user one or.

1804
02:10:31,400 --> 02:10:34,160
Okay, so right now where is this coming

1805
02:10:38,400 --> 02:10:39,800
in the local wrap?

1806
02:10:39,800 --> 02:10:40,520
Right.

1807
02:10:40,680 --> 02:10:45,000
So let's go ahead and do this.

1808
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:48,000
Let's create a new commit

1809
02:10:49,240 --> 02:10:52,720
and let's color it with

1810
02:10:54,680 --> 02:10:55,560
let's do it.

1811
02:10:55,560 --> 02:10:56,760
All right.

1812
02:10:57,480 --> 02:11:00,360
So that's like I make that user one mean

1813
02:11:01,640 --> 02:11:04,000
okay, deleting that user one was working,

1814
02:11:04,680 --> 02:11:09,280
user two was sitting idle.

1815
02:11:09,280 --> 02:11:12,400
No, he was working on his own code.

1816
02:11:12,400 --> 02:11:13,080
Right.

1817
02:11:13,200 --> 02:11:16,160
So what he will be doing,
let's in parallel

1818
02:11:16,920 --> 02:11:20,000
pretend to be two
and let's make some changes.

1819
02:11:20,440 --> 02:11:25,320
So he was also a very good,
good programmer, so whatever.

1820
02:11:25,680 --> 02:11:27,320
And he created a new

1821
02:11:28,320 --> 02:11:31,560
file and he named it user to

1822
02:11:35,840 --> 02:11:39,200
creatures.

1823
02:11:39,200 --> 02:11:42,240
See, I added some features

1824
02:11:43,320 --> 02:11:45,800
in there please.

1825
02:11:45,800 --> 02:11:51,240
How to log.

1826
02:11:51,240 --> 02:11:54,880
Okay, this is being tracked right now

1827
02:11:55,080 --> 02:11:58,480
for user to know.

1828
02:11:58,720 --> 02:12:00,200
He also needs to add.

1829
02:12:00,200 --> 02:12:03,080
So now we use it to

1830
02:12:04,160 --> 02:12:06,360
get at dot

1831
02:12:07,440 --> 02:12:09,600
that commit dash and

1832
02:12:11,160 --> 02:12:13,560
use it to put

1833
02:12:15,160 --> 02:12:16,920
features

1834
02:12:17,360 --> 02:12:21,000
at the purpose of it.

1835
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,400
So now let's do this
in the simulation. Also

1836
02:12:35,120 --> 02:12:37,760
and it can be difficult.

1837
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:51,480
So this one.

1838
02:12:51,480 --> 02:12:55,080
Okay, now

1839
02:12:55,920 --> 02:12:57,120
User one and use it

1840
02:12:57,120 --> 02:12:59,960
two were working in parallel

1841
02:13:01,080 --> 02:13:05,040
and we are adding in could

1842
02:13:07,800 --> 02:13:10,920
everyone should have this back
intersect our classes.

1843
02:13:10,960 --> 02:13:13,360
Okay do I'm just set.

1844
02:13:13,360 --> 02:13:15,560
What do you mean by I'm set? I started.

1845
02:13:16,200 --> 02:13:19,160
I said that the location of the package,

1846
02:13:19,360 --> 02:13:22,240
the code is not important at all.

1847
02:13:22,360 --> 02:13:24,440
What's important is the concept.

1848
02:13:24,440 --> 02:13:27,240
It's not important about the file
is what I would add.

1849
02:13:27,240 --> 02:13:27,840
The kind of file.

1850
02:13:27,840 --> 02:13:30,480
It's just not at all important.

1851
02:13:30,480 --> 02:13:35,040
Okay, How commits are working,
how we are one, we are interested in that.

1852
02:13:35,360 --> 02:13:41,400
We are not interested in coding.

1853
02:13:41,400 --> 02:13:45,720
Okay, so now do you guys think
that they will be able

1854
02:13:45,720 --> 02:13:49,160
to push at the same time? Let's

1855
02:13:52,040 --> 02:13:52,680
be realistic

1856
02:13:52,680 --> 02:13:58,680
about it.

1857
02:13:58,680 --> 02:13:59,440
Well,

1858
02:14:00,360 --> 02:14:03,640
someone was push first and the other user
is going to push out the

1859
02:14:03,880 --> 02:14:06,760
maybe it's
two second, second or something like that.

1860
02:14:07,080 --> 02:14:10,920
Yeah, well, that makes sense, right?

1861
02:14:10,920 --> 02:14:11,280
Okay.

1862
02:14:11,280 --> 02:14:17,600
So user, do you want to
when user want to use it to.

1863
02:14:17,600 --> 02:14:20,480
Okay, so you the one, So user one

1864
02:14:21,720 --> 02:14:24,480
let's open, it's terminal,

1865
02:14:24,960 --> 02:14:27,720
let's check this connection

1866
02:14:28,280 --> 02:14:30,840
it said connected

1867
02:14:30,840 --> 02:14:33,840
branch just main

1868
02:14:35,160 --> 02:14:37,160
it's already main depth

1869
02:14:37,160 --> 02:14:41,360
path.

1870
02:14:41,360 --> 02:14:44,840
Okay so user one has

1871
02:14:46,440 --> 02:14:48,720
successfully

1872
02:14:49,680 --> 02:14:51,960
first deployed the command over here.

1873
02:14:52,080 --> 02:14:55,200
It will perform that

1874
02:14:58,160 --> 02:15:04,800
over. Now

1875
02:15:08,080 --> 02:15:10,400
let's do this for user to

1876
02:15:12,480 --> 02:15:18,360
get push.

1877
02:15:18,360 --> 02:15:33,480
What's that?

1878
02:15:33,480 --> 02:15:34,720
We need to understand this.

1879
02:15:34,720 --> 02:15:38,960
First of all, let's read
this error Trust me, this error.

1880
02:15:39,360 --> 02:15:43,200
All of you will be giving a lot.

1881
02:15:43,200 --> 02:15:45,240
You will be getting this error a lot.

1882
02:15:45,240 --> 02:15:48,840
And I don't want to see anyone pushing,

1883
02:15:49,760 --> 02:15:53,040
you know, posting this error in support
channel because.

1884
02:15:53,040 --> 02:15:54,160
I told you the solution.

1885
02:15:54,160 --> 02:15:57,600
It will really make me happy
if you are able to resolve on your own.

1886
02:15:57,800 --> 02:16:01,600
Okay. So

1887
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:05,160
this is

1888
02:16:05,640 --> 02:16:09,960
the first left with the error
to say that reject it.

1889
02:16:09,960 --> 02:16:12,480
The main fact first

1890
02:16:13,760 --> 02:16:16,320
failed to push some reference to this.

1891
02:16:16,400 --> 02:16:19,360
Like Apple objects were rejected

1892
02:16:19,680 --> 02:16:24,080
because the remote contains work
that you do not have locally.

1893
02:16:24,400 --> 02:16:25,800
Is that true?

1894
02:16:26,160 --> 02:16:30,600
But that remote has some work
which we do not have locally.

1895
02:16:30,840 --> 02:16:36,040
Is that true?

1896
02:16:36,040 --> 02:16:40,320
Okay, so those of you who are saying no,
it's saying that the mode has some work

1897
02:16:41,160 --> 02:16:43,840
which you do not have looking,
so does this work

1898
02:16:44,840 --> 02:16:49,560
is it there locally here and use a to know

1899
02:16:49,560 --> 02:16:52,080
so it just telling us that

1900
02:16:53,520 --> 02:16:54,640
this is usually caused

1901
02:16:54,640 --> 02:16:57,680
by another repository
pushing to the same wrap.

1902
02:16:58,320 --> 02:17:00,800
Wow. It's
telling me that this is usually caused

1903
02:17:00,800 --> 02:17:03,600
because another
repository is pushing them.

1904
02:17:05,560 --> 02:17:06,360
You may want

1905
02:17:06,360 --> 02:17:08,520
to first integrate the more changes

1906
02:17:09,560 --> 02:17:14,240
using get to default working again.

1907
02:17:14,240 --> 02:17:17,800
Okay,
so getting is telling us the solution

1908
02:17:17,800 --> 02:17:20,560
to our problem also.

1909
02:17:20,840 --> 02:17:24,120
So if this error this
but by you guys in future

1910
02:17:24,240 --> 02:17:26,760
so you'll be able to solve it

1911
02:17:27,760 --> 02:17:29,200
for the world

1912
02:17:30,840 --> 02:17:34,200
you are saying no or yes

1913
02:17:34,200 --> 02:17:36,520
Alex I'm when to come to that doing

1914
02:17:39,920 --> 02:17:42,000
okay so now let's

1915
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,320
first understand that what's happening

1916
02:17:45,240 --> 02:17:47,400
so when we tried to push here

1917
02:17:48,600 --> 02:17:51,400
get it confused
it says that hey if you try

1918
02:17:51,400 --> 02:17:54,320
want me to push this code above this,

1919
02:17:55,440 --> 02:17:58,840
then you are not going to have

1920
02:17:58,840 --> 02:18:02,400
the same history as that on the GitHub.

1921
02:18:03,840 --> 02:18:05,840
So remember we talked about this,

1922
02:18:05,840 --> 02:18:09,120
that takes history, racism, right?

1923
02:18:09,920 --> 02:18:11,400
It is very serious about history.

1924
02:18:11,400 --> 02:18:13,200
It does not feel any.

1925
02:18:13,200 --> 02:18:17,080
No. Relax in that like that.

1926
02:18:17,080 --> 02:18:21,160
You should you must follow the history. So

1927
02:18:24,480 --> 02:18:24,680
do you

1928
02:18:24,680 --> 02:18:28,000
guys understand this, why it needs to be?

1929
02:18:28,680 --> 02:18:31,360
It's giving us power at this point.

1930
02:18:31,360 --> 02:18:35,320
Just know

1931
02:18:35,560 --> 02:18:38,040
that it won't happen due to the cooling.

1932
02:18:38,680 --> 02:18:40,280
It's happening because of the commit.

1933
02:18:40,280 --> 02:18:45,240
Okay, let's understand this again.

1934
02:18:45,240 --> 02:18:47,680
But not good.

1935
02:18:47,680 --> 02:18:51,240
We have not discussed this yet.

1936
02:18:51,240 --> 02:18:52,480
Okay, guys, I'm.

1937
02:18:52,480 --> 02:18:55,080
I'm going over to this again.

1938
02:18:55,080 --> 02:18:57,840
So user one posted scored.

1939
02:18:57,840 --> 02:18:59,880
He was able to point

1940
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:03,160
now user to is pushing at school so

1941
02:19:06,560 --> 02:19:08,240
what should happen

1942
02:19:08,440 --> 02:19:13,600
ideally speaking this code should go
in there and Leo in here is that correct?

1943
02:19:13,600 --> 02:19:14,800
Ideally

1944
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:20,600
this is what we are expecting right.

1945
02:19:20,600 --> 02:19:23,200
This is what we expect to happen.

1946
02:19:23,200 --> 02:19:25,040
Okay, let's suppose this happened.

1947
02:19:25,040 --> 02:19:27,640
Let's suppose this for now.

1948
02:19:27,640 --> 02:19:32,680
Tell you this, the history, this apple
and this particular apple are the same

1949
02:19:36,360 --> 02:19:36,720
because

1950
02:19:36,720 --> 02:19:40,520
after the fifth commit,
it has been coming back over here

1951
02:19:40,520 --> 02:19:47,360
after the fifth commit
it has an orange coming.

1952
02:19:47,360 --> 02:19:58,720
So that's
why it's going to give us an error.

1953
02:19:58,720 --> 02:20:01,560
Okay so what we'll do

1954
02:20:02,400 --> 02:20:06,600
will open up the time to say, okay,
there is something that's updated,

1955
02:20:06,800 --> 02:20:11,400
so let's step,
which is the thing which is updated.

1956
02:20:11,400 --> 02:20:15,480
So in order to check
what's the update, only get fast.

1957
02:20:16,120 --> 02:20:20,600
So get factual to tell us
whether there is an update.

1958
02:20:20,800 --> 02:20:22,680
Yes. Or No.

1959
02:20:22,680 --> 02:20:25,720
Right now,
if this command gives us no answer,

1960
02:20:25,720 --> 02:20:27,400
it means that there is no update.

1961
02:20:27,400 --> 02:20:29,840
But right now it's giving us some answer.

1962
02:20:30,240 --> 02:20:33,840
And it's telling me that particular
main origin slash

1963
02:20:33,840 --> 02:20:58,840
mean has been updated.

1964
02:20:58,840 --> 02:20:59,520
Okay.

1965
02:20:59,520 --> 02:21:02,600
So before we go, let's
simply run the command

1966
02:21:02,600 --> 02:21:06,240
with log.

1967
02:21:06,240 --> 02:21:09,640
Let us commit the user to future added.

1968
02:21:10,200 --> 02:21:11,120
Okay, remember that

1969
02:21:17,320 --> 02:21:17,800
you guys.

1970
02:21:17,800 --> 02:21:20,280
I checked using fact there was an update.

1971
02:21:20,320 --> 02:21:23,600
What should I do?

1972
02:21:23,600 --> 02:21:31,160
So get for.

1973
02:21:31,160 --> 02:21:31,880
Okay.

1974
02:21:33,960 --> 02:21:37,520
So let's understand that
now what is happen

1975
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:49,080
will it in their

1976
02:21:52,160 --> 02:21:54,520
no doubt if that's not how I would proceed

1977
02:21:55,400 --> 02:21:58,800
now build it here
and he's saying that okay

1978
02:21:59,040 --> 02:22:03,640
I want put it above this particular commit
but you already have a commit to a new

1979
02:22:05,640 --> 02:22:14,840
what should I do?

1980
02:22:14,840 --> 02:22:18,160
Make sense.

1981
02:22:18,160 --> 02:22:20,920
It wants to put it
above this particular commit,

1982
02:22:21,440 --> 02:22:24,920
but it already has a commit doing it.

1983
02:22:24,920 --> 02:22:37,840
So what?

1984
02:22:37,840 --> 02:22:40,360
Okay, so

1985
02:22:41,280 --> 02:22:43,760
those of you who are saying that

1986
02:22:45,840 --> 02:22:48,840
you this is an absolute
very good solution,

1987
02:22:48,840 --> 02:22:52,640
very good use of staff, if you have not

1988
02:22:54,520 --> 02:23:00,320
committed this change.

1989
02:23:00,320 --> 02:23:03,120
But once the committed made,
can you guys make a staff

1990
02:23:07,080 --> 02:23:07,760
know?

1991
02:23:07,760 --> 02:23:10,560
So a good practice and a very good tip

1992
02:23:10,560 --> 02:23:15,200
for you, for all of you

1993
02:23:16,720 --> 02:23:23,040
before making a comment, use get facts

1994
02:23:24,240 --> 02:23:26,000
to make sure

1995
02:23:26,800 --> 02:23:29,680
there are no updates

1996
02:23:30,120 --> 02:23:34,960
unless there are any updates.

1997
02:23:34,960 --> 02:23:37,320
Stature could

1998
02:23:38,960 --> 02:23:40,640
pull the report

1999
02:23:41,560 --> 02:23:41,880
better.

2000
02:23:41,880 --> 02:23:43,200
Make the comment

2001
02:23:45,600 --> 02:23:48,760
to explain what Alex.

2002
02:23:49,320 --> 02:23:51,920
What do you want to make that make the
what do you want me

2003
02:23:51,920 --> 02:23:57,760
to explain?

2004
02:23:57,760 --> 02:24:06,640
Sure.

2005
02:24:06,640 --> 02:24:08,680
What are you guys waking up with now?

2006
02:24:08,800 --> 02:24:09,920
We start

2007
02:24:11,360 --> 02:24:14,520
I'm going to add
so that we cannot that Alex,

2008
02:24:14,520 --> 02:24:16,520
because you have already made
the commitment.

2009
02:24:16,520 --> 02:24:19,440
Once you have made
the commit, it's not possible to start

2010
02:24:20,040 --> 02:24:23,040
because remember, stacking does
what it brings

2011
02:24:23,040 --> 02:24:25,840
the working directly
back to the condition of the report.

2012
02:24:26,280 --> 02:24:30,720
But what how would do that if they're at
one of the work that we are saying

2013
02:24:38,400 --> 02:24:44,920
that okay, after you pull that

2014
02:24:44,960 --> 02:24:48,440
but you have to apply the stats one
what is that request or you are just

2015
02:24:50,280 --> 02:24:51,920
stacking your call will keep it

2016
02:24:51,920 --> 02:24:56,040
for you of stacking
your goal will keep it for you.

2017
02:24:56,040 --> 02:24:59,080
Formatting this free writing set.

2018
02:24:59,640 --> 02:25:01,800
I should know
that's that's not the purpose.

2019
02:25:01,800 --> 02:25:02,600
Special purpose.

2020
02:25:02,600 --> 02:25:04,360
Whatever we discuss the same like that.

2021
02:25:04,360 --> 02:25:06,880
I'll give you an example on that
and then it will get more clear.

2022
02:25:07,160 --> 02:25:12,200
For now, I want every one of you to be
sent to the point where I am right now.

2023
02:25:12,360 --> 02:25:15,480
What we said is that this code

2024
02:25:15,480 --> 02:25:17,160
is here, right?

2025
02:25:17,160 --> 02:25:19,360
And according to the history,
when we are pulling it,

2026
02:25:19,880 --> 02:25:25,840
it wants to go in there.

2027
02:25:25,840 --> 02:25:26,560
What are you guys think?

2028
02:25:26,560 --> 02:25:32,160
Will it be able to go in there?

2029
02:25:32,160 --> 02:25:35,160
No, because there is already a comment
that has been made.

2030
02:25:35,160 --> 02:25:35,760
And remember,

2031
02:25:35,760 --> 02:25:39,920
we talked about that it does not allow us
to make changes in the history.

2032
02:25:40,120 --> 02:25:41,960
So we put it in here.

2033
02:25:41,960 --> 02:25:44,680
That will be making a change
in the history

2034
02:25:45,080 --> 02:25:50,160
right.

2035
02:25:50,160 --> 02:25:52,640
So get has a solution for that.

2036
02:25:53,840 --> 02:25:55,440
It says that,

2037
02:25:55,440 --> 02:25:58,320
okay, bring this also.

2038
02:25:59,840 --> 02:26:11,400
Now tell me, which code

2039
02:26:11,880 --> 02:26:14,360
do you want to keep out of this board

2040
02:26:14,560 --> 02:26:20,240
and make a comment.

2041
02:26:20,240 --> 02:26:23,680
So it is bringing us this code
and it just saying that choose

2042
02:26:25,200 --> 02:26:27,280
which code do you want to be

2043
02:26:27,280 --> 02:26:29,080
and make a comment

2044
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:31,920
right now.

2045
02:26:31,920 --> 02:26:41,160
Are there going to be any conflicts
between these two code?

2046
02:26:41,160 --> 02:26:41,560
Okay.

2047
02:26:41,560 --> 02:26:52,760
So where is the conflict going to be?

2048
02:26:52,760 --> 02:26:55,200
The both users created this separate file.

2049
02:26:55,200 --> 02:26:58,240
Remember,

2050
02:26:58,240 --> 02:27:00,360
they created their own separate files.

2051
02:27:01,600 --> 02:27:17,440
So do you guys think
there will be any conflict?

2052
02:27:17,440 --> 02:27:19,440
But they do not have the same name, right?

2053
02:27:19,440 --> 02:27:25,840
If they have the same name,
then obviously there can.

2054
02:27:25,840 --> 02:27:27,360
So here's what's going to happen.

2055
02:27:27,360 --> 02:27:29,240
It will say that

2056
02:27:30,920 --> 02:27:32,320
most them together

2057
02:27:32,320 --> 02:27:37,120
and make a comment, merge them together
and make a comment.

2058
02:27:37,120 --> 02:27:40,720
So right now quite open up my comment
and I show you what does it show me.

2059
02:27:41,280 --> 02:27:44,440
They show me
merge branch mean off this particular

2060
02:27:46,440 --> 02:27:48,200
project and

2061
02:27:48,200 --> 02:27:51,560
enter a commit message
to explain why this merger is necessary,

2062
02:27:52,320 --> 02:27:55,960
especially if merge is an update upstream
into what topic branch

2063
02:27:56,240 --> 02:27:57,080
you will learn about.

2064
02:27:57,080 --> 02:27:59,600
What is an update stream
and what's a topic branch.

2065
02:28:00,040 --> 02:28:02,720
So it's asking us to place up commit

2066
02:28:03,720 --> 02:28:04,240
name.

2067
02:28:04,240 --> 02:28:06,640
It's automatically making a comment.

2068
02:28:06,640 --> 02:28:09,440
So let's name it.

2069
02:28:09,440 --> 02:28:10,240
Well,

2070
02:28:13,200 --> 02:28:15,360
in order to do that we have to press I

2071
02:28:16,640 --> 02:28:19,880
this is the merge comment

2072
02:28:22,760 --> 02:28:25,160
and that is the

2073
02:28:25,160 --> 02:28:25,840
problem.

2074
02:28:26,120 --> 02:28:31,200
W q object.

2075
02:28:31,200 --> 02:28:36,200
So what happened

2076
02:28:36,600 --> 02:28:40,120
after you jump to feature added

2077
02:28:41,800 --> 02:28:47,080
it merge the branch at this point.

2078
02:28:47,080 --> 02:28:49,840
Let me show you in the diagram

2079
02:28:52,440 --> 02:28:56,400
it created the new comment about this
and it colored it.

2080
02:28:57,080 --> 02:29:00,000
Yeah.

2081
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:03,400
So at this point
what happened is the merging

2082
02:29:06,120 --> 02:29:09,000
we are doing, we are going to be
discussing merging a lot.

2083
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:12,680
So even if it sounds a little bit
confusing, don't worry about this.

2084
02:29:14,120 --> 02:29:16,000
Tell me, is this

2085
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:26,560
a little bit to all of you
that what's happening?

2086
02:29:26,560 --> 02:29:28,960
We have a whole that's fine.

2087
02:29:28,960 --> 02:29:31,240
We have a whole

2088
02:29:31,440 --> 02:29:35,160
one class
dedicated to merge and merge conflict.

2089
02:29:35,160 --> 02:29:37,360
You will the idea to worry about this.

2090
02:29:37,360 --> 02:29:40,760
I only want to make sure
that you guys do understand that

2091
02:29:42,160 --> 02:29:45,640
that's what why it cannot come in here.

2092
02:29:47,040 --> 02:29:49,560
Okay.

2093
02:29:49,560 --> 02:29:50,320
Okay.

2094
02:29:50,320 --> 02:29:51,720
And you guys do understand that?

2095
02:29:51,720 --> 02:29:53,360
Why it cannot go over here.

2096
02:29:53,360 --> 02:29:57,560
Do you guys understand this?

2097
02:29:57,560 --> 02:29:59,800
Okay, that's perfect.
That's. That's great.

2098
02:30:00,600 --> 02:30:03,440
We will discuss merge and how to resolve

2099
02:30:03,440 --> 02:30:06,440
this in our class on Saturday.

2100
02:30:06,600 --> 02:30:08,280
This concept is important for today.

2101
02:30:08,280 --> 02:30:09,840
If you got it, that's perfect.

2102
02:30:09,840 --> 02:30:11,000
This is the rules.

2103
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,280
You should know
that you can not push it right away.

2104
02:30:13,800 --> 02:30:17,560
This is the goal. Yes.

2105
02:30:17,560 --> 02:30:19,000
Tomorrow's review.

2106
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:22,560
Okay,
So just forget everything I told you guys

2107
02:30:22,560 --> 02:30:26,160
about the merger and stuff
that that a little bit complicated.

2108
02:30:26,160 --> 02:30:29,000
I know that you guys do not need
to remember it.

2109
02:30:29,400 --> 02:30:33,120
Just understand that you cannot do this.

2110
02:30:33,400 --> 02:30:35,760
Okay? Do I have the thumbs up for this?

2111
02:30:35,760 --> 02:30:36,920
This concept is clear, right?

2112
02:30:36,920 --> 02:30:41,680
You can do this now for this reason.

2113
02:30:41,680 --> 02:30:46,680
Okay, So now.

2114
02:30:46,680 --> 02:30:48,640
Yes, I do have. Okay.

2115
02:30:50,160 --> 02:30:50,720
Okay, guys.

2116
02:30:50,720 --> 02:30:53,760
So let's do one thing.

2117
02:30:53,760 --> 02:30:57,880
How about we put you to one example?

2118
02:30:57,880 --> 02:31:01,480
Yes, I do understand that
it's a little bit complicated concept.

2119
02:31:01,800 --> 02:31:04,280
And we have
who will file our class for that.

2120
02:31:04,280 --> 02:31:08,400
Okay.

2121
02:31:08,400 --> 02:31:10,560
Yes, we're not discussing that.

2122
02:31:10,560 --> 02:31:10,880
Okay.

2123
02:31:10,880 --> 02:31:14,400
So, guys,
I just need 5 minutes, then you have plan.

2124
02:31:14,440 --> 02:31:17,960
I need 5 minutes of your time.

2125
02:31:17,960 --> 02:31:20,000
Yes, the minimum count. Okay.

2126
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:23,120
So how about if instead of

2127
02:31:23,120 --> 02:31:27,560
using this approach,
I do need the users to represent

2128
02:31:27,880 --> 02:31:32,040
and use that same technique
to show you how we can proceed with that?

2129
02:31:32,840 --> 02:31:34,080
Is that fine

2130
02:31:36,160 --> 02:31:36,600
today?

2131
02:31:36,600 --> 02:31:39,400
Show you guys how to use stacking to work
this problem,

2132
02:31:41,320 --> 02:31:42,840
this mess problem?

2133
02:31:42,840 --> 02:31:44,960
How come you are doing this session?

2134
02:31:44,960 --> 02:31:48,320
Let's understand that

2135
02:31:48,800 --> 02:31:51,320
know for how this is going to be
this last session.

2136
02:31:51,320 --> 02:31:53,640
You guys already know
it's going to be simple.

2137
02:31:53,640 --> 02:32:01,120
So let's imagine, like on this repository,
that's simple, right?

2138
02:32:01,120 --> 02:32:02,680
Let's delete this repo.

2139
02:32:02,680 --> 02:32:04,680
So user two is going to

2140
02:32:06,960 --> 02:32:10,160
up sorry.

2141
02:32:10,160 --> 02:32:19,040
Oops.

2142
02:32:19,040 --> 02:32:20,880
In fact, I can not do this.

2143
02:32:20,880 --> 02:32:23,960
I just remember
because I have already pushed

2144
02:32:23,960 --> 02:32:32,040
the pool is right.

2145
02:32:32,040 --> 02:32:34,960
Even if I'd known this,
it would bring the yellow ones.

2146
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:37,360
Okay like an animal class.

2147
02:32:37,360 --> 02:32:40,440
Now that seems good.

2148
02:32:40,440 --> 02:32:42,400
Okay, so let's it out

2149
02:32:42,400 --> 02:32:46,960
quickly.

2150
02:32:46,960 --> 02:32:49,520
Get back here, get one,

2151
02:32:50,040 --> 02:32:54,760
and then I'm going to take the address
so other guys can. I.

2152
02:32:54,840 --> 02:32:55,800
Don't worry.

2153
02:32:55,800 --> 02:32:57,160
Unsafe hands.

2154
02:32:57,160 --> 02:33:00,520
Trust me.

2155
02:33:00,520 --> 02:33:02,120
Okay, get going. Is here.

2156
02:33:02,120 --> 02:33:08,400
So in the simulation,
we control this project.

2157
02:33:09,120 --> 02:33:11,600
No matter. Everything is zero.

2158
02:33:11,600 --> 02:33:13,320
You will be okay about my doing.

2159
02:33:13,320 --> 02:33:14,680
Okay, guys. So retention.

2160
02:33:14,680 --> 02:33:17,400
I just need 4 to 5 and then we are good

2161
02:33:18,560 --> 02:33:19,080
right now.

2162
02:33:19,080 --> 02:33:20,840
User one has this is free

2163
02:33:20,840 --> 02:33:24,800
GitHub has this is free and user two has
this is we are good on that.

2164
02:33:24,960 --> 02:33:30,720
You have your yes on this.

2165
02:33:30,720 --> 02:33:33,480
Perfect. So now let's do one thing

2166
02:33:34,880 --> 02:33:37,040
Let's go to

2167
02:33:37,040 --> 02:33:38,720
user one

2168
02:33:41,280 --> 02:33:44,240
and make some changes.

2169
02:33:44,240 --> 02:33:46,080
So let's delete my feature you the one

2170
02:33:46,080 --> 02:33:50,640
and I do not.

2171
02:33:50,640 --> 02:33:56,080
I deleted it.

2172
02:33:56,080 --> 02:33:56,920
Okay.

2173
02:33:57,040 --> 02:34:12,240
And I made a comment.

2174
02:34:12,240 --> 02:34:14,520
So in actual what will happen?

2175
02:34:14,520 --> 02:34:16,080
User one

2176
02:34:16,640 --> 02:34:20,240
made another comment and let's color this

2177
02:34:21,720 --> 02:34:22,760
red pink.

2178
02:34:22,760 --> 02:34:25,680
Okay?

2179
02:34:25,680 --> 02:34:28,560
And also let's push
this coming to the GitHub,

2180
02:34:28,920 --> 02:34:30,760
send it to your top

2181
02:34:32,400 --> 02:34:33,800
and I do this

2182
02:34:35,200 --> 02:34:36,960
the history same right, but history

2183
02:34:36,960 --> 02:34:55,200
since I will be able to do that.

2184
02:34:55,200 --> 02:34:59,760
Okay so this one, I'm all good.

2185
02:34:59,760 --> 02:35:03,320
Okay, now let's work for user two.

2186
02:35:04,480 --> 02:35:05,400
Meanwhile, use it.

2187
02:35:05,400 --> 02:35:07,560
Two was working and he did what?

2188
02:35:07,560 --> 02:35:11,760
He opened his RC and he created a new

2189
02:35:13,920 --> 02:35:14,160
okay.

2190
02:35:14,160 --> 02:35:17,880
He made some changes and use my future use

2191
02:35:17,880 --> 02:35:20,440
The one said that

2192
02:35:27,840 --> 02:35:29,040
he made some changes

2193
02:35:30,520 --> 02:35:32,640
and then what he did

2194
02:35:40,560 --> 02:35:46,200
is he opened up his terminal.

2195
02:35:47,760 --> 02:35:50,440
Oh did Sorry KDDI

2196
02:35:52,360 --> 02:35:55,560
are this status

2197
02:35:59,640 --> 02:36:00,640
of this terminal?

2198
02:36:00,640 --> 02:36:02,040
And he looked at his status.

2199
02:36:02,040 --> 02:36:04,840
He said, okay, I need to practice.

2200
02:36:05,800 --> 02:36:09,120
I need to make a comment
of this particular file.

2201
02:36:09,320 --> 02:36:09,960
Right.

2202
02:36:10,640 --> 02:36:14,160
This is what he wants to do.

2203
02:36:14,160 --> 02:36:18,480
But this user,
Wan, is the one who will start get by me

2204
02:36:19,440 --> 02:36:21,120
because this is me actually.

2205
02:36:21,120 --> 02:36:23,840
So you will say, Hey,
before I make a comment,

2206
02:36:24,720 --> 02:36:27,680
let me do one thing that people could do.

2207
02:36:27,680 --> 02:36:31,240
Get fetch.

2208
02:36:31,240 --> 02:36:33,560
Oh, my God. There's an update

2209
02:36:33,560 --> 02:36:34,160
I got.

2210
02:36:34,160 --> 02:36:35,440
I did not make a comment.

2211
02:36:35,440 --> 02:36:37,840
I'm an intelligent person.

2212
02:36:37,840 --> 02:36:40,920
Before I make the commit,
let's update my history

2213
02:36:41,080 --> 02:36:44,880
to avoid that kind of mess
which we were discussing

2214
02:36:44,880 --> 02:36:51,560
before.

2215
02:36:51,560 --> 02:36:54,120
So what? What should he do?

2216
02:36:55,040 --> 02:36:57,840
Get cool.

2217
02:36:57,840 --> 02:37:00,480
Okay. Before that?

2218
02:37:00,480 --> 02:37:03,320
Yes. First what he would say,
I can use it.

2219
02:37:03,360 --> 02:37:03,920
Okay.

2220
02:37:03,920 --> 02:37:09,280
Let me start The changes that I have
and that I'll do get cool.

2221
02:37:09,480 --> 02:37:11,320
So let's say get stats that am

2222
02:37:12,640 --> 02:37:15,000
the changes that I need

2223
02:37:31,960 --> 02:37:37,560
changes now

2224
02:37:39,200 --> 02:37:44,120
get pull the

2225
02:37:57,960 --> 02:38:01,520
you pull the code from the GitHub.

2226
02:38:02,520 --> 02:38:05,520
The history is same

2227
02:38:05,520 --> 02:38:09,120
and now he will make the comment

2228
02:38:10,400 --> 02:38:12,200
that add not

2229
02:38:16,440 --> 02:38:18,440
the comment

2230
02:38:18,440 --> 02:38:30,800
about shadow.

2231
02:38:30,800 --> 02:38:45,160
Oh why is that so.

2232
02:38:45,160 --> 02:38:47,600
I forgot to reapply the flash. Right.

2233
02:38:48,680 --> 02:38:52,120
So good stuff list.

2234
02:38:52,120 --> 02:38:54,480
Good stuff applied

2235
02:38:55,480 --> 02:38:58,680
zero.

2236
02:38:58,680 --> 02:39:03,360
And we have a conflict in features 140

2237
02:39:03,640 --> 02:39:08,040
the deleted in upstream
and modified entity that doesn't matter.

2238
02:39:08,880 --> 02:39:11,520
That's good status.

2239
02:39:11,520 --> 02:39:12,520
That's fine. That's fine.

2240
02:39:12,520 --> 02:39:15,200
Don't worry
if this message is not relatable.

2241
02:39:15,600 --> 02:39:18,920
Oh, okay.
We have our file right. Good app.

2242
02:39:18,920 --> 02:39:25,800
Not good comment that am

the changes and get full.

2244
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:34,560
Please leave these both. Yeah,
there you go.

2245
02:39:35,280 --> 02:39:37,640
And if I show you on the simulation

2246
02:39:38,880 --> 02:39:41,160
he has just created a new comment

2247
02:39:45,240 --> 02:39:46,440
here and then he

2248
02:39:46,440 --> 02:39:50,880
pushed it. Oh,

2249
02:39:53,600 --> 02:39:54,200
okay.

2250
02:39:54,200 --> 02:39:55,960
So guys, listen.

2251
02:39:55,960 --> 02:39:59,880
And that little ember class
and I'll give 5 minutes to answer

2252
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:03,120
your queries and questions
that those of you who got an e-mail.

2253
02:40:03,960 --> 02:40:07,200
The last thing that I want to see
for this, today's class is

2254
02:40:08,200 --> 02:40:13,280
do you guys understand
the concept of fashion?

2255
02:40:13,280 --> 02:40:15,840
All of you have a smooth, simple right.

2256
02:40:16,600 --> 02:40:20,560
You got to understand what how to clone

2257
02:40:25,720 --> 02:40:26,440
clothing is clear.

2258
02:40:26,440 --> 02:40:30,840
Do you guys know the purpose of that

2259
02:40:30,840 --> 02:40:36,600
command?

2260
02:40:36,600 --> 02:40:37,320
Okay.

2261
02:40:37,640 --> 02:40:39,760
Do you guys know the purpose of Blue

2262
02:40:43,160 --> 02:40:44,800
for fact?

2263
02:40:44,800 --> 02:40:47,280
That is all that you need to know.

2264
02:40:47,280 --> 02:40:49,280
Okay, that's enough.

2265
02:40:49,640 --> 02:40:52,560
This example that I showed you,
I'll be going over

2266
02:40:52,560 --> 02:40:57,080
to this again in the next class,
and the next

2267
02:40:57,080 --> 02:41:00,720
two classes
will be dedicated to all of this stuff.

2268
02:41:00,720 --> 02:41:04,320
So, guys, don't worry,
don't feel anything.

2269
02:41:04,320 --> 02:41:06,360
I'm here in the last two classes.

2270
02:41:06,360 --> 02:41:09,400
These all concepts
are going to be very clear to all of you.

2271
02:41:09,880 --> 02:41:10,920
Don't worry at all.

2272
02:41:10,920 --> 02:41:13,680
Okay, great.

2273
02:41:15,280 --> 02:41:17,080
It was fun, right,

2274
02:41:17,080 --> 02:41:20,640
Wasn't it?

2275
02:41:20,640 --> 02:41:22,920
I'm going to answer the question
and just just to list

2276
02:41:28,920 --> 02:41:31,280
how I get it.

2277
02:41:32,240 --> 02:41:37,880
Now, obvious
to those of you who are, you know, tired,

2278
02:41:37,880 --> 02:41:42,240
they believe I'm here for the question
answer session and everyone is welcome.

2279
02:41:42,480 --> 02:41:48,480
So now anyone who had any questions,
I still don't understand

2280
02:41:48,480 --> 02:41:51,680
after we call the project made our changes
and we need to come in.

2281
02:41:52,560 --> 02:41:54,680
Do we need to create new let's

2282
02:41:55,200 --> 02:41:57,960
put it for a push to the more
or it's already do.

2283
02:41:58,440 --> 02:41:59,480
That's okay.

2284
02:41:59,480 --> 02:42:00,200
So you

2285
02:42:00,440 --> 02:42:03,120
the thing is asking
a very interesting question

2286
02:42:03,120 --> 02:42:06,000
and that is that once
you have another apple,

2287
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:08,760
you need to establish the link
or create the rapport.

2288
02:42:08,760 --> 02:42:09,840
I'm not

2289
02:42:10,600 --> 02:42:13,560
so sure even Lorne,

2290
02:42:13,560 --> 02:42:14,520
this is a question right

2291
02:42:24,320 --> 02:42:26,840
now. This was a question

2292
02:42:28,560 --> 02:42:32,040
we know the project made us think that
and we need to come at it.

2293
02:42:32,040 --> 02:42:35,480
Do we need to create a new local approval
for the remote?

2294
02:42:37,320 --> 02:42:39,440
Okay, because I'm going to answer that.

2295
02:42:39,440 --> 02:42:39,600
This.

2296
02:42:39,600 --> 02:42:42,800
Is that so why don't you go under Apple?

2297
02:42:42,800 --> 02:42:44,800
Let's say that you clone
this particular apple,

2298
02:42:45,960 --> 02:42:46,680
okay?

2299
02:42:46,760 --> 02:42:49,800
This is the apple that you call under
system.

2300
02:42:49,800 --> 02:42:52,920
Okay, So there

2301
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:55,360
now, whenever you want to make a commit
do you need to create

2302
02:42:55,360 --> 02:43:06,840
a new was this.

2303
02:43:06,840 --> 02:43:11,160
No, you do not have to because
it's already there you just make comments

2304
02:43:11,160 --> 02:43:13,600
in that.

2305
02:43:13,600 --> 02:43:14,320
Okay.

2306
02:43:15,240 --> 02:43:21,320
Now with next server,

2307
02:43:21,320 --> 02:43:24,560
this is why we need to cool
that you can do it.

2308
02:43:25,800 --> 02:43:29,600
I knew about then, but you just.

2309
02:43:29,600 --> 02:43:31,600
I'm confused why we need to do it.

2310
02:43:31,920 --> 02:43:33,360
We will do it any way.

2311
02:43:33,360 --> 02:43:36,240
By other way,
how how else will you do it? So one

2312
02:43:39,880 --> 02:43:43,000
the does that we cannot do yoga.

2313
02:43:43,120 --> 02:43:50,400
I'll answer that.

2314
02:43:50,400 --> 02:43:53,400
What's this? Barbara?

2315
02:43:53,400 --> 02:43:54,520
I did not get your question.

2316
02:43:54,520 --> 02:43:59,560
Can you start with.

2317
02:43:59,560 --> 02:44:00,240
Okay,

2318
02:44:02,920 --> 02:44:04,280
so let's do it.

2319
02:44:04,280 --> 02:44:06,520
I mean, you can redefine
the question, please.

2320
02:44:06,520 --> 02:44:07,840
I'm going to answer you.

2321
02:44:07,840 --> 02:44:10,320
You need to write the whole question.

2322
02:44:10,320 --> 02:44:12,280
Without start, you cannot get full.

2323
02:44:12,280 --> 02:44:15,840
So you you're asking that cannot
without stats, we cannot do

2324
02:44:17,400 --> 02:44:18,280
yoga.

2325
02:44:18,720 --> 02:44:22,520
I it will be like this that I'll see

2326
02:44:22,800 --> 02:44:25,280
you should not do get full

2327
02:44:27,240 --> 02:44:29,520
until you have check

2328
02:44:29,520 --> 02:44:33,240
that there is something on the remote
that needs to be pulled

2329
02:44:33,240 --> 02:44:37,920
and your history is same
you can do get without good stats,

2330
02:44:38,640 --> 02:44:44,040
but it will may
or may not give you a conflict.

2331
02:44:44,040 --> 02:44:47,880
We have a way of dealing with that too,
but that's a little bit messy.

2332
02:44:47,880 --> 02:44:49,120
I will teach you that thing.

2333
02:44:50,640 --> 02:44:51,240
Okay.

2334
02:44:51,240 --> 02:44:52,800
I will teach you that way too.

2335
02:44:52,800 --> 02:44:54,600
I will not need that.

2336
02:44:54,600 --> 02:44:56,200
You will be learning. Exactly.

2337
02:44:56,200 --> 02:44:59,440
But it's a good practice
that whenever you make a comment

2338
02:44:59,640 --> 02:45:02,000
and you're working on some repository,

2339
02:45:02,600 --> 02:45:04,720
you just before making the comment

2340
02:45:05,880 --> 02:45:08,040
fetch and see if there are any updates.

2341
02:45:08,040 --> 02:45:10,920
If you synchronize your

2342
02:45:10,920 --> 02:45:12,040
lookups.

2343
02:45:12,400 --> 02:45:13,880
Okay.

2344
02:45:13,880 --> 02:45:16,920
And someone

2345
02:45:20,600 --> 02:45:21,560
now server

2346
02:45:21,560 --> 02:45:26,080
you can do go ahead with in
without letting this one more reason

2347
02:45:26,480 --> 02:45:29,200
why you need to teach up
any of the questions.

2348
02:45:29,200 --> 02:45:32,040
So again, if you can redefine
your question, I love to answer that

2349
02:45:32,040 --> 02:45:37,840
because honestly right now
I don't understand what you want asking.

2350
02:45:37,840 --> 02:45:40,960
That's okay.

2351
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:41,400
Got it.

2352
02:45:41,400 --> 02:45:53,080
Perfect.

2353
02:45:53,080 --> 02:45:55,240
Okay, so I have been taking out

2354
02:45:55,240 --> 02:45:58,840
anyone else
who needs to have a need to ask a question

2355
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:02,760
by volume.

2356
02:46:02,760 --> 02:46:05,760
So when you move the 500
more to the local,

2357
02:46:05,800 --> 02:46:13,480
you need to make a new book coming right?

2358
02:46:13,480 --> 02:46:21,600
No. Anymore.

2359
02:46:21,600 --> 02:46:26,720
Okay,
So let's say that this is the scenario.

2360
02:46:26,720 --> 02:46:29,400
One, two, three, four, five, one,
two, three, four, five.

2361
02:46:29,400 --> 02:46:32,560
User one post

2362
02:46:32,560 --> 02:46:36,520
this particular orange coming in there.

2363
02:46:36,520 --> 02:46:37,200
Okay?

2364
02:46:37,200 --> 02:46:41,000
And use it to just pull it

2365
02:46:42,960 --> 02:46:44,520
so it's going to be there.

2366
02:46:44,520 --> 02:46:47,160
We do not have to make a new comment

2367
02:46:47,160 --> 02:46:49,600
when we have to make a move
to make that scenario.

2368
02:46:49,600 --> 02:46:52,320
I'll discuss it
with you in the next class.

2369
02:46:52,720 --> 02:46:54,680
Okay, So don't worry about that.

2370
02:46:54,680 --> 02:46:57,360
You do not have to make
a new commitment report.

2371
02:46:58,200 --> 02:47:00,480
That is a special kind of scenario that

2372
02:47:00,480 --> 02:47:04,080
when that occurs, will

2373
02:47:05,880 --> 02:47:09,040
okay, so any other I will

2374
02:47:10,240 --> 02:47:10,840
share the

2375
02:47:12,120 --> 02:47:15,560
second one that you add I

2376
02:47:20,280 --> 02:47:22,000
any second one,

2377
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:24,520
you need to be more elaborate

2378
02:47:25,080 --> 02:47:30,000
when you ask a descriptive question.

2379
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:32,120
I need to understand that
what you look like that's

2380
02:47:34,320 --> 02:47:36,400
on the correct step set

2381
02:47:37,800 --> 02:47:41,520
then Steph then pull that apply

2382
02:47:42,360 --> 02:47:44,760
add commit, push.

2383
02:47:44,760 --> 02:47:45,840
Yes, ma'am.

2384
02:47:45,840 --> 02:47:55,440
These are the three steps,
but you do not have to remember that.

2385
02:47:55,440 --> 02:47:57,680
Okay, Just make sure of it.

2386
02:47:57,680 --> 02:48:02,040
You should know it conceptually,
because there are a lot with all of this.

2387
02:48:02,240 --> 02:48:04,320
The scenarios might change.

2388
02:48:04,320 --> 02:48:07,760
You have to understand the concept.

2389
02:48:07,760 --> 02:48:10,920
So let's say you had a red box then.

2390
02:48:11,160 --> 02:48:17,960
So do you mean to say that this red box
is the hundred one?

2391
02:48:17,960 --> 02:48:18,480
Okay.

2392
02:48:18,480 --> 02:48:21,560
And then now I wanted to move
to the local regional use,

2393
02:48:21,560 --> 02:48:25,480
the one I used to.

2394
02:48:25,480 --> 02:48:27,880
Okay. So I think we want to move it to the

2395
02:48:28,880 --> 02:48:31,640
third right.

2396
02:48:31,640 --> 02:48:32,920
Let's see.

2397
02:48:32,920 --> 02:48:33,600
Okay.

2398
02:48:33,600 --> 02:48:36,480
So I'll use get pull
and it will simply move it

2399
02:48:36,480 --> 02:48:45,720
above here.

2400
02:48:45,720 --> 02:48:47,960
I see. Yeah, we can do it.

2401
02:48:48,280 --> 02:48:52,720
But the only problem is going to be
when you have this red box over here

2402
02:48:53,040 --> 02:48:56,400
and you have one new coming
yellow coming your way here,

2403
02:48:57,480 --> 02:49:02,680
then will you be able to do it? No.

2404
02:49:02,720 --> 02:49:05,160
Now there will be a problem.
How to resolve that problem?

2405
02:49:05,160 --> 02:49:06,720
Why did it occur?

2406
02:49:06,720 --> 02:49:09,440
We will discuss that in our next class.

2407
02:49:09,520 --> 02:49:24,280
Okay. No.

2408
02:49:24,680 --> 02:49:28,840
Anyone else?

2409
02:49:28,840 --> 02:49:32,880
Schools.

2410
02:49:32,880 --> 02:49:33,600
Thank you.

2411
02:49:33,600 --> 02:49:47,520
Done.
