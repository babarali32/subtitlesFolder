1
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:08,760
Soon.

2
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,040
We're calling

3
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,680
and you guys hear me? See the screen?

4
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,560
Everything is good.

5
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,200
All right, Perfect. Perfect.

6
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,000
I mean, we are good to go.

7
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,120
How's everyone doing?

8
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,480
Are you guys excited
for your second class?

9
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,800
All right.

10
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,760
All right.

11
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,560
Any of you, by any chance, looked at

12
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,840
what Agile is?

13
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,320
Some of you did.

14
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,040
That's good.

15
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,040
Okay.

16
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,200
Even just a little bit of.

17
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,320
Even if you just watched a five minute
video, I think that's good enough.

18
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,920
So you will have an understanding.

19
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,040
We'll go quite into it today.

20
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,760
We'll cover a lot of terminologies,

21
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,200
but trust me, guys, don't freak out
if you don't remember all of them.

22
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,800
Over the next six months,
this will become very easy for you.

23
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,960
So if it seems like a little too much
terminology,

24
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,800
you just don't get scared by any chance.

25
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,440
Agile.

26
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:12,000
You know, in the tech world,
you know, sometimes very simple things

27
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,720
are complicated because of different
wording, right?

28
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,120
So that's what happens,
unfortunately, sometimes

29
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,240
very easy things because of the wording
and the vocab is very different.

30
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,040
You know, the lingo is always different.

31
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,040
So it kind of throws you off at times,

32
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,800
but it can be very simple things,

33
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,840
agile. That became my philosophy.

34
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,880
Absolutely. We're going to get into that.

35
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,360
Yeah, just just a lot of terminology
and you will get used to it.

36
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,200
Agile
is probably going to be more important.

37
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,440
Waterfall was great
to know how it is though, but

38
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,800
because a lot of industry
and the industry, a lot of companies

39
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,200
are going towards Agile, so it's important
to know some of the terminology.

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,480
But before we get into it, let's do this.

41
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,000
Let's do a quick recap.

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,840
What did we cover yesterday?

43
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,720
Let's cover quickly
what we cover yesterday.

44
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,520
We'll go for this, spend about 10 minutes
on this, 15 minutes, and then we'll

45
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,280
jump into

46
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,040
Agile.

47
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,440
So who on to get started.

48
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,120
Okay,
we did Waterfall and we cover SDLC, Right?

49
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,800
All right, so let's do this.

50
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,880
Let's start off with SDLC.

51
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,120
First of all, what does SDLC stand for?

52
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,360
The software development lifecycle.

53
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,040
Okay, great, great, great.

54
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,720
Now it has some phases.

55
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,000
If I'm correct, right?

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,720
What is the very first phase

57
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,200
in the planning phase?

58
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,640
Right.
And we talked about the planning phase.

59
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:51,840
What really happens in the planning phase,
Something would be a meeting

60
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,680
with the customer.

61
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,720
Yes, Well, very beginning,
of course, in the planning phase one.

62
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,320
Part of it is they do market research,
feasibility study.

63
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,680
This will come basically
from the client itself.

64
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,760
They will understand.

65
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,840
And if something, let's say the product
they want to develop,

66
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,000
is it worth it for them or not?

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,800
Then there's an individual
that works with the client.

68
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,200
The customer, right?
We call him client and customer.

69
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,160
Who is that individual?

70
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,400
Very good business analysts.

71
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,800
Are you guys becoming business analysts?

72
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,200
Is it, you know, Right.

73
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,680
But is good to know what they do,
What what do they do?

74
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:36,480
Basically,
what do you guys think what they do,

75
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,760
they document, read,
they gather requirements.

76
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,280
They basically pick
the brains of the customer.

77
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,160
What exactly they want. Right.

78
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,720
And they make something called a BRT dock
and business requirement document.

79
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,560
Those are basically what is not.

80
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,200
Let me ask you, what is a requirement? It

81
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,240
what is

82
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,680
the requirement?

83
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,840
What the client customer wants
basically Absolutely.

84
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,320
Is the functionality.

85
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,400
Remember that
now we're coming into the tech world,

86
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,480
so we'll try to use more tech
related words.

87
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,480
So functionalities of the system,
the target system

88
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,320
that the customer wants, needs,
whatever is the right.

89
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,520
So that's basically
what that requirements are

90
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,680
and that the job of business analysts
to gather all of that

91
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,680
document, all of that, right,
they are the one documenting all of this.

92
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,520
So they will have a conversation
with the customer.

93
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,720
We call the customer, we call them client.

94
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,880
You know, they do the talking.

95
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,080
They do all the different type
of requirements.

96
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,240
You know, they grab all those details.

97
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,640
And when they write all those details,
that's something that we're going

98
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,440
to be working on in the future.

99
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,520
Now, they could be talking to listed
the business, corporate individual

100
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,840
or also the end user.

101
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:06,480
What do I mean by the end user?

102
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,960
Basically, the people actually
who will be using it, Right?

103
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,520
So the example yesterday I was giving you
that I worked for United State.

104
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,640
Well, I was working on a project
for the United States Postal Service rate.

105
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,280
I r t
would meet the corporate business side,

106
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,840
but then the end user will be the people
actually at the post office.

107
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,360
Right.

108
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,360
Who are running basically the post office
or the post man, you know,

109
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,880
those are the end user.

110
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,240
We were just dealing with the customer
in the sense of the business side,

111
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,360
but the end user are the ones who actually
get to play what with the software.

112
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,440
It's something you creating,

113
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,720
so you're picking their brains,
stakeholder, other management people,

114
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,720
anyone who's a very,
let's say, experienced individual

115
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,760
in that field or in that company,
whichever it is, right?

116
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,200
You're picking all their brains
to basically get all the feedback.

117
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,040
Now, this picture
I showed you guys yesterday,

118
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,560
how the requirement gathering can go
sometimes wrong

119
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:10,560
and this is a very true scenario
and we look at it in the tech world

120
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,640
today, we're going to go into a little bit
of project failures and etc., etc..

121
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,320
So you kind of get an idea

122
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,560
that job of is the job of a business
analyst.

123
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,120
Important guys

124
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,800
on a 1 to 10 scale.

125
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,640
How important is it

126
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,760
if the ten heads of that?

127
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,080
Ten. Yes, absolutely.

128
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,560
Because everything starts
from there, right.

129
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,720
So if the customer explained, let's

130
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,400
say a swing with three outermost steps,

131
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,680
you want to call them or seats,
you know, that's how they explain.

132
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,120
It's the job of the business analyst
to make sure they get

133
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,440
the requirements precise enough

134
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:54,240
so that we we can develop them
a system that they exactly one.

135
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,920
But what happens
unfortunately in the tech world

136
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:02,000
and it happens a lot of times
is how the customer by explaining

137
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,120
how the other rest of the team
might understand might be not exactly

138
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,280
what they think they were building. Right.

139
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,960
So a lot of time gets wasted on this
if this is not done accurately.

140
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,520
That's why I said this picture is a true,

141
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,400
you know,

142
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,600
of fact of, you know,
what happens in the tech world.

143
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,120
A lot of projects
that fail can be like this

144
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,560
and it can start off
from from the very beginning.

145
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,760
What is a good way for a business analyst
to gather requirement

146
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,440
using what type of creator area
you would say smart radio, Right.

147
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,600
Smart basically means specific,
measurable, attainable

148
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,880
or relevant and time based realistic ones.

149
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,160
You know, things that make sense.

150
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,360
You know, a customer can require

151
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,120
want you to build some crazy
new application that's not even possible.

152
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,760
Or maybe whatever it is right.

153
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,240
But, you know,
it's the job of the business analysts

154
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,680
to make sure that the customer understand
that, hey, we can actually do this.

155
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,120
We cannot do this right.

156
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,080
I give you an example.

157
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,720
Yesterday's well to that, you know,
our company, Hewlett Packard Enterprise,

158
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,200
got this project that the customer
wanted to be develop in one year.

159
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,480
And we knew from day one it was not
possible as a three year project.

160
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,320
So, you know, it's important that,
you know, it's

161
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,680
we get the right requirements
and those requirements can, you know,

162
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,040
can tell a completely different story
if it's done the right way.

163
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,360
Right.

164
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,320
And you can come up with a very successful
project.

165
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,000
But, you know, the requirements have to be
clear, it's not important for you

166
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,240
in the sense of gathering the requirement,
but you are still involved as a tester.

167
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,120
What are we doing?

168
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,760
When do we start beginning testing?

169
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:48,800
Tricky question and see,
do we start testing after

170
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,360
the development happens or do we start
at the beginning in the planning part

171
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,680
when requirements are gathered, new

172
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,200
Agassi You got a little bit confused.

173
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,720
Yeah, it's good. I'm glad.

174
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,160
So yes, of course you do.

175
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,200
The actual coding and everything,
you know, you do all that.

176
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,040
But when we get the requirements, you
remember this, guys, You remember this.

177
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,120
A testers job is to test
those requirements.

178
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,200
The is basically
your putting your input from day one.

179
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,440
Of course, you're doing all the coding

180
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,240
and everything later on
when the development happens. Yes.

181
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:28,880
But without let's say doing actual
technical or coding type of testing,

182
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:33,080
we call this verification testing,
basically checking the requirement.

183
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,960
Are they correct?
Are we giving it a different angle?

184
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,840
We look at it from different perspective.

185
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,560
Maybe they missed something great.

186
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,160
So remember this one
when a business analyst basically

187
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,680
gathers requirements straight
from the client, they go back and forth.

188
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,400
You know, those requirements are
then brought to the team, the entire team.

189
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,360
They are meetings on these
and you will be attending these meetings,

190
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,200
especially the project is brand
new right at the very beginning.

191
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,760
You'll be attending those meetings.

192
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,440
The business owners
might be going over each requirement.

193
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,400
This is what the customer want,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, etc..

194
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,080
There you can look at those requirements
to be like, Hey,

195
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,880
what about did he,
the customer want this feature as well?

196
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,040
Do we miss this?

197
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,080
You know, you're basically analyzing,
breaking it down.

198
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,360
See if you're missing anything there.

199
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,480
So we technically
start testing at that point.

200
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,040
But this testing, when you call
this, is more verification

201
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,000
of the documentation
of the basically the requirement.

202
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,960
So it's not actually doing
coding in manual in automation testing.

203
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,200
So it's happening there.

204
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,800
Is it possible waterfall to.

205
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,080
Absolutely, it's possible.
The same exact thing.

206
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,920
Remember this we as Tester,
we're there to break the system,

207
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,960
so we play around with the application
that's created in multiple ways.

208
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,960
We do everything
so we get a better feel of it.

209
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,960
So we're always in the habit of,
you know, like like I said yesterday,

210
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,440
we're like detectives, right?

211
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,760
What was looking from different angles
and that's what we do.

212
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,480
So when it comes to basic
these requirements and these requirements

213
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,320
at the beginning is gather
and you are involved in these meetings,

214
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,040
you can analyze this thing.

215
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,840
It doesn't have to be that you come up
with, you know, some flaws

216
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,800
or maybe some things like this that, hey,
maybe you missed this requirement,

217
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,600
but it's important that, you know, you
you as a tester

218
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,960
is involved in that and analyzing
these requirement and looking at them.

219
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,920
You could use the same smart criteria
as well, too.

220
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,120
So it's not your job exactly to

221
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,720
to get the requirements,
but to look at them, analyze them.

222
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,800
Absolutely. You can do that.

223
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,840
All right. So now the planning is done.

224
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:45,000
What comes afterwards, guys?

225
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,080
The design phase, right? Okay.

226
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,760
What happens in the design phase?

227
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:55,680
What exactly happens there?

228
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,840
The architecture of it. Okay.

229
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,400
They design the wireframe, they go
someone use the wireframe.

230
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,080
Lifeson is basically the picture, the,
the whole style of it, actually,

231
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,320
you know what? Let me do one thing.

232
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:12,920
Let me show you what a wire film
looks like if you haven't seen one before,

233
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:17,040
let me see Wireframe.

234
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,040
Then you pull this up. There you go.

235
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,760
So right here, quickly, I just brought up
you see wireframe, right?

236
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,280
These type of design.
Just look at this one.

237
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,520
A wireframe right sign in here,
it goes here, etc..

238
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,480
This is for an app, for example. Right.

239
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,120
The layout, the mockups.

240
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,800
This is what a designer is doing.

241
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,120
And they're trying to also make sure it is
nice and clean the entire process.

242
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,240
You know, it looks esthetically easy.

243
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,320
I look esthetically looks fine
and at the same time easy to use.

244
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,960
Not this is what who does this part of
basically coming up with idea?

245
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,360
What is that individual call,

246
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,600
not the architect.

247
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,200
Great

248
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:01,360
UX UI UX user
interface in user experience.

249
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,120
Yeah those

250
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,880
you'll see sometime you call them,
you might hear them as product designer.

251
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,320
This is actually a title and individual
who does this.

252
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,640
So this is what they're doing.
They creating this.

253
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,240
Now an architect is thinking of,
okay, honey service do we need

254
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,800
And they will also have, let's
see, conversation with the developers.

255
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:24,000
Which programing language
are we going to use for this project?

256
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,600
You know, there's different
programing languages out there is Ruby,

257
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,720
there's Python, JavaScript, Java,
C++, C-sharp, so many languages, right?

258
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,600
But the team, the technical individual
decide, okay, this we're going to

259
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,000
which database we're going to use.

260
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,920
So a lot of
this is happening in the design phase.

261
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,840
And also very important to understand

262
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,320
is in the design phase,
they're also thinking of the future.

263
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,760
Is the system going to when, let's say,

264
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,640
more customer comes, will more traffic
comes on the system,

265
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:56,520
Are we going to be able to scale it
by scaling means, can we upgrade?

266
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,920
Can we handle all that,
you know, traffic and things?

267
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:04,400
So from the hardware perspective,
the architect we're looking at so quite

268
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:08,160
a bit, you know, they involve multiple
members are involved in the design phase.

269
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,840
We as a tester are not really involved.

270
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,840
Yes, we might attend the meetings.

271
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,360
No, but
we are not doing too much in there.

272
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,520
Yes, I live yes UI in UX

273
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,600
UI UX you will always see UI with a slash.

274
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,600
That's usually the title
of a product designer UI UX.

275
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,520
And you will notice,

276
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,920
I think when you go the higher
they call them product design designer

277
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:30,960
do test.

278
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,520
You use hacking tactics? Not really.

279
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,880
Security
testing comes a little bit different.

280
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,200
Security
is more of a cybersecurity approach.

281
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,560
They will do it.
They're called penetration testers.

282
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,120
They will do that. All right.

283
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,240
So now after the design happens, wait,
what comes along

284
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,280
after this

285
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,480
development implementation now?

286
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,560
Are we developing as testers in here
as well to

287
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,240
say it's a yes or no?

288
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,360
No, All programmers, right.

289
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,680
Developers, software engineers,
whatever you want to call them,

290
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,240
they have different titles. Right.

291
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,160
They are the one then basically
are the one coding,

292
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,320
making sure whatever the picture is UI,
everything comes to light.

293
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,720
Remember I said the skeleton
is that that the design basically

294
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,200
and putting the muscle on a skeleton
is what the job of a developer is.

295
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,480
They're doing all of that.

296
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,640
So they're bringing that UI, UX,
all of this

297
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,360
that you're seeing, for example,
these are just images, right?

298
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,320
They're bringing it to life by adding
code behind all of this.

299
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,560
So right now the signing button
you will click on, it's nothing,

300
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,480
There's nothing but the coding
that we add, CSS, JavaScript,

301
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,360
all the different coding they do,
they add behind it, it becomes to life.

302
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,640
That's what the developers do, right?

303
00:16:53,800 --> 00:17:00,000
So after the development is done,
what happens afterwards?

304
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,640
Testing? Absolutely.

305
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,480
You guys come in to do the testing.

306
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:09,200
That is your job by this point to test
the system, making sure it's working fine.

307
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,960
What happens if you find some issues?

308
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,200
Do you fix it?

309
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:19,040
Do you as a tester, fix them or no?

310
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,760
Good job, guys. Yes. You don't fix them.

311
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,800
You report it to the developer
and they fix it.

312
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,000
We never fix any of the bugs.

313
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,160
We just report and identify.

314
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,960
That's where our job stops.

315
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,240
Basically, fixing the headache
can be a whole the developers headache.

316
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,680
That's their job to basically fix
all of that right now after this,

317
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:44,520
what happens usually after all the testing
and everything is done, we go live,

318
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:49,160
we deploy, it goes to production rate,
production basically means it goes live.

319
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,280
And after.

320
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,280
When it goes live, yes,
there is some maintenance afterwards, too.

321
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,200
It depends.

322
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,640
Some company does maintenance.

323
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,760
Some companies don't do it
at all. Depends.

324
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,720
And maintenance
means that log system is up and running.

325
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,520
Maybe they'll have two or three
people just keeping an eye.

326
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,560
If something goes bad,
you know, they'll fix it.

327
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,040
But usually when something goes live,
it goes to production.

328
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:19,000
This this will have basically
a little bit of maintenance.

329
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,480
Will a tester be similar to a copywriter?

330
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:27,320
I'm trying to understand
this more as an analogy.

331
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,880
I don't know what it does,
to be very honest with you.

332
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,080
So I'm not sure I'm
sorry about like happily that

333
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,520
when a copywriter does,

334
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,480
I really don't.

335
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,280
Okay.

336
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,920
But it basically doesn't
make sense, right?

337
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,440
It makes sense after the production.

338
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,960
Basically we're going into the maintenance
by remember,

339
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,880
some companies do maintenance,
some companies don't do maintenance.

340
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,640
That's why
I didn't make another slide for this.

341
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,840
I just put it in the picture.
Okay, it's there.

342
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,000
That's fine, though,
but this is what happens.

343
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Planning
allows for design, implementation,

344
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,600
testing and means is
this is software development lifecycle.

345
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:09,360
So this overall is the key structure
behind any and every software.

346
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:13,280
Now, I explained to you guys yesterday
something called Waterfall.

347
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,600
So what do you think waterfall is?

348
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,320
When we brought Waterfall up

349
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,960
to buy,
what do we see our methodology, Right.

350
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,040
Methodology of development.
Yes, absolutely.

351
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,280
I mean, this is basically a companies
way, a process that before

352
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,000
they're following SDLC. Exactly.

353
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,440
But they're following it in their own
fashion, their own way of basically

354
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,920
creating this software.

355
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,800
Now, when we say methodology, right, look,

356
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,800
a company can do things
in whatever fashion they want to.

357
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:52,960
It's an approach.

358
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,240
Yes. It's an approach of SDLC,

359
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,560
how they do it, how they do their meetings
when they want.

360
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,920
They can make changes.

361
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,960
They can make changes
whatever they want to do, basically.

362
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,440
Right.

363
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,760
So what were some of the advantages
which let me ask you this.

364
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,760
When do you use waterfall?

365
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,600
When it would be a
best time to use waterfall in

366
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,120
small
and simple projects, when you also have

367
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:25,560
very, very clear requirements,
Very key to understand this,

368
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,840
when there's a clear picture,
when quality, not speed.

369
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,120
Right. That's very important.

370
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,440
In an agile, we going to we're more
focused on speed, not so much on quality.

371
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,680
And I'll explain to you that later on.

372
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:42,240
So when the client won't change much
scope, the project is more straightforward

373
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,400
forward, easy
to understand, easy to manage.

374
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,800
It's a step by step process.

375
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,360
Can it work for long projects?

376
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,320
It can work.

377
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,080
But again,

378
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,680
you know, your your your very beginning,
your requirement has to be very clear.

379
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,560
The one thing in waterfall rule
you mentioned

380
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:02,280
is the disadvantage of it
is you cannot make any changes.

381
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,960
That's one of the biggest
this is management, right?

382
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,600
It's a step by step process.

383
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,360
Once a step is completed,
you cannot go back.

384
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,560
So let's see, design phase is done.

385
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,600
And in the development phase,

386
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:17,600
developer thinks that, hey, the design is
not done in the right matter.

387
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,520
Sorry they can't change anything now.

388
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,520
Then it goes to testing.

389
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:26,160
Now in in waterfall, when we find bugs
and we find flaws,

390
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:32,640
are they going to be fixed or no?

391
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,520
Yes and no.

392
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,680
Someone said we are 5050. Yes.

393
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:41,880
Now remember this guys, when we are in
waterfall, still as a job, as a tester.

394
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,280
When we find issues, laws rate.

395
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,560
Those can be fixed.

396
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:50,880
The only thing that cannot be fixed
or change is requirement changes.

397
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,640
Remember that you will find bugs,
you'll find bug.

398
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,080
They're going to fix it.

399
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,360
But a requirement changes.

400
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,560
Let's say for
example, a feature. Let's see

401
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,120
o'clock

402
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,200
in feature, let's say time
processing one right is on a page

403
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,040
on the left side of of a page,
for example, it wasn't working.

404
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:11,240
You told developer fix it,
but it should be on the right side, right?

405
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,920
That would be a new requirement

406
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,800
to be on a different page
or different part of the application.

407
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,680
That's a requirement change right?
That's not allowed.

408
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,560
So remember
this, bugs can be reported in waterfall.

409
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,680
Absolutely. And they're going to be fixed.

410
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,520
A lot of people get this wrong that,
hey, you,

411
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,920
when you find bugs in a waterfall,
you can fix them.

412
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,040
So that's not right.

413
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,000
Bugs can be fixed.

414
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,600
We just cannot add new requirements.

415
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,680
So we look at it.

416
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:41,520
One thing that happens is a lot of times,
guys, time gets cut.

417
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,240
Shorts toward the end always happens.

418
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,280
And they rushed testing
one time and budget

419
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,480
is basically cuts
who decide which method to use.

420
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,680
Well a lot of times
it's the upper management that decides.

421
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:57,080
At the very beginning, though, remember,
let's say,

422
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:02,040
for example, Bank of America
hired Deloitte or Booz Allen Company,

423
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,000
of course, experience individual from,
let's say Booz Allen can suggest

424
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,560
we would like to create this application
using this methodology.

425
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:14,280
Or maybe let's say that the client can say
we want you to make this

426
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:18,320
in a waterfall methodology or this
So those things are decided

427
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:23,240
at the very beginning and more
on the top management I tester developer.

428
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:27,720
Yet we don't have the authority
in that sense that comes from the program

429
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,480
managers up top who decides and work

430
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,840
really with the project
gets said they're the one deciding that

431
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,360
so basically are too risky

432
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,760
change of course we went over this but
this is a sequential process as we see.

433
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,120
And yeah, one step is done.

434
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:50,120
You cannot go back majority of the,
you know, government agencies,

435
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:54,320
they are the one who use waterfall
private sector all to use the waterfall.

436
00:23:54,520 --> 00:24:00,120
But not as much as basically when it comes
down to the waterfall methodology.

437
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,640
So quick recap.

438
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,040
Does it make sense?

439
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,920
Can we move on guys,
after this and get into a new topic?

440
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:08,840
All right.

441
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:12,000
So if someone didn't understand,
hopefully with a quick

442
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,120
recap, it made sense.

443
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,400
So let's move on to today.

444
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,360
What we're going to do
is we're going to break down

445
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:23,920
basically what is Agile, what is Scrum
Fear Framework, Scrum Artifact

446
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,520
and some scrum roles basically.

447
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,600
So we're going to go into
another methodology which is more popular

448
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,280
a lot faster.

449
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,240
You will decide if it is good or bad
after knowing

450
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,000
some pros and cons about it
and you'll understand this.

451
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,480
So let me ask you this
before we get into tech.

452
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,480
I like to bring some other examples
right through you guys.

453
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:49,680
Which restaurant, a fast food restaurant
do you enjoy with a fast service?

454
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,880
Let's think of this.

455
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,160
Tell me some restaurants
that has a very cool process.

456
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,240
You know, McDonald's, That's fine.

457
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:01,680
Chick fil A is okay,
but think of it in the think of Agile

458
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,360
where, you know, when you go
in, you get your product and you go out

459
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,880
and now a Chick fil A

460
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,040
Walmart does not count as fast food

461
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,480
as subway or subway can be looked at.

462
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,240
And I say subway or let's say Chipotle.

463
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:19,560
Right.

464
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,760
Did they stick out to me more?

465
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,680
Now, of course, McDonald's.

466
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:27,120
I'm glad that you bringing McDonald's
if you guys haven't watched this movie.

467
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,640
It's called the Founder.

468
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,560
Do watch that movie talks
about how McDonald's became

469
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:35,280
massive because of their of their process,

470
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,400
how they change internally,
how they became fast.

471
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,120
Yeah, that movie.

472
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,040
I love that money.

473
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,560
I'm sure you love money. And the movie

474
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,360
so you don't get it shows
you're very insight into all of that.

475
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:48,840
Right.

476
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,440
But Chipotle let's talk about
just Chipotle or Subway, right?

477
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:56,240
Why I like Chipotle and why
I picked Chipotle out of all of them is

478
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,440
just think of the church
supporting their process.

479
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,560
What what makes it so amazing?

480
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,600
Why do you guys think
Chipotle is so successful?

481
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,720
One of the reasons they're cutting
invented the assembly line type of thing.

482
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,960
Basically cheap and good.

483
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,440
Everything is in front of you.

484
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,720
You're going to line.

485
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,640
You pick your for example, let's say,
first of all, one of the beautiful thing

486
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,880
about Chipotle is

487
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,840
you can see the entire kitchen,
what they're doing,

488
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,680
if they're using gloves or not, what's
which is nicer.

489
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,880
You can see all of that.

490
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,040
But you go like an assembly line, guys.

491
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,200
You go and you pick your bowl or let's
say, I don't know, burrito, whatever.

492
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,120
You pick all the items and right behind
you are

493
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,920
their customers are coming
the same way and out the way you go.

494
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:42,320
Basically right now, of course, after
Chipotle they you know more restaurants

495
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,640
came and everything they follow
the same process cilantro, rice and

496
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,920
I guess are making you guys hungry
already.

497
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,360
Right.

498
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,160
But if you look at it, you know,
and if you look at it from the

499
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,720
the way how they operate, it's very quick,
very fast.

500
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,760
And you get exactly what you want.

501
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,720
And out the window you go basically,
it's a very fast pace now, if you compare,

502
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,320
let's say Chipotle led to, let's say,
a different experience rate,

503
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,080
let's say, I don't know, Olive Garden.

504
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,000
Right. A dining restaurant, for example.

505
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,360
What is it time for you
to get food in a dining restaurant?

506
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,200
Let's see.

507
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,200
How long would it take?

508
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,200
20 to 40 minutes.

509
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,920
30 minutes sometimes. Right.

510
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,360
It takes a lot longer.

511
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,160
What we say? Who makes more money?

512
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:34,520
Let's say a dining restaurant
or fast food?

513
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,880
More like fast food, right?

514
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,280
Because they're serving a lot of customer.

515
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,440
They're doing a high volume.

516
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,200
They're doing at a very high volume.

517
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,600
Now, of course, they experience
in a dining restaurant would be a lot

518
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,200
different in the sense
you were romantic or this and that.

519
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,280
Whatever special occasion.

520
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,840
But at the same point,
if you look at it, two different concept.

521
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,200
One is serving a lot of customers, right?

522
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,080
If you want to serve a lot of customers,

523
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:02,920
you cannot make a customer where customers
wait 20 or 30 minutes week.

524
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,720
That's that's why fast food
chains and restaurants, you know, they

525
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,400
they're making a lot of money
because they have a process.

526
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,520
They have a entire
process that's, you know,

527
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:15,920
worked on.

528
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,600
It has been improved
over the course of years.

529
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,160
And they can serve a lot of customers
through that process.

530
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,960
It's very fast rate.

531
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,120
So when we think of that, you know,
when we think of Chipotle,

532
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,600
we think of Chipotle as as Agile,
where we're going to go in

533
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,600
to basically a more into the
the technical part.

534
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,080
But think of it as more agile over the.

535
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,920
Now let me give you another example.

536
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:42,680
What is guys
which car do you guys think that is

537
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,160
probably the most popular or car brand
that's the most popular in the world.

538
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,680
There you see the cars everywhere.

539
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,600
Any part of the world.

540
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,200
You go into Hondas or Tesla,
as someone said, Tesla,

541
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:58,920
but no Toyota guys, Toyota,
Toyota, Toyota, Chevrolet.

542
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:04,680
I yeah, but more if we're talking on
a global scale, I think Toyota wins the

543
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,000
the game in there.

544
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,520
Remember guys
Toyota was one of the very first companies

545
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,320
in the 1960s that kind of use agile

546
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:18,840
process in their assembly line,
in their production facilities.

547
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,320
Right.

548
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,640
That's why they're able to churn out
so many vehicles.

549
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,040
And when you turn out

550
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:28,280
so many vehicles and things that age,
the cost becomes very low

551
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,600
because you have so much surplus of it
out in the market.

552
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,080
Right.

553
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:36,480
They're able to they're able to produce
cars at a very low cost.

554
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,960
And even the maintenance of a car
like Toyota is very cheap

555
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:44,080
because so much parts
and so many Toyota's are out there.

556
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,760
Right. It makes it very cheap.

557
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:50,240
But what is the success behind Toyota
is because they use more of a lean,

558
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,280
agile process in their assembly lines
at the very beginning.

559
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,280
Today,
we're going to find out some meetings

560
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:00,600
and things that, you know, you will do
when you're in an Agile project.

561
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,840
For example,
they used to do similar ways in the 1960s.

562
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,480
So remember this Agile?

563
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,880
What were we going to learn today?

564
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:12,280
There's not only applied to it,
it can apply to any industry

565
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,600
and it comes way before that.

566
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:19,480
In the sixties, like I said, is
when Toyota utilized Agile methodology.

567
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,760
So it basically,
you know, really changed the game

568
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,480
of how they produce cars and how many cars
they were producing get the

569
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,040
Uber equals 90% of Toyota.

570
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,080
I'm I'm sure.

571
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,880
Well, they're very reliable cars.

572
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,880
You know they're they're cheap
and they're and good quality cars

573
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:44,560
that they last for a long time.

574
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,280
Okay.

575
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,280
Let me give you another example,

576
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,040
just so you can

577
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,960
basically get the bigger picture
and then we're going to start jumping

578
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,360
to more agile.

579
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:56,040
Now, if I were to basically let's say
I have a customer, I give this example

580
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,160
every time I do this class.

581
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:02,280
So let's say I have a customer
who places an order for manufacture,

582
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,040
let's say,
I don't know, a table, right, for example.

583
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,280
And the customer gives me
the specifications.

584
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:13,400
Wait, I want a table that's wooden
with four legs green legs, whatever it is.

585
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,520
Read all the specification.

586
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:19,640
And two weeks later, for example,
it gives me, Hey, I want this table,

587
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:23,880
custom table to be built in in two weeks
and it's going to cost you.

588
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,720
I'm going to pay
you $200, let's say, for example.

589
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,280
Right. So let's say I work on the table.

590
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,240
Everything I put the color,
put the pieces, different type of wood,

591
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,680
whatever it is, I do it.

592
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,600
And let's say two weeks down the road,

593
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,160
I give this to my customer
and the customer is not really happy.

594
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,680
They're like, Hey,
you're wasting my two $200 on this table.

595
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,000
I don't like it, right?
Go ahead and make changes.

596
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,320
Most likely

597
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:52,160
what the the manufacturer of the table
would say, basically, okay, you know what?

598
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,200
We're going to charge you
another 50 bucks for making these changes.

599
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,280
Wouldn't that be very similar to,
let's say put it this way, more waterfall,

600
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,720
right.

601
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:05,760
Very similar to waterfall approach
in, let's say, creating a table right now

602
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,160
if we were to do this in a agile
manner. Right.

603
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:12,600
So let's say I've been given a two weeks
time frame and $200 budget,

604
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,400
so what would I do? Right.

605
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:18,240
Let's say on the on the third day
I call the customer, Hey,

606
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,360
customer, you know, I've chosen this would

607
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,880
which what do you prefer
Which material let's say.

608
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,640
Right.
Which type of what are you preferring?

609
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,320
The customer might say, okay,
I like this one better.

610
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:32,040
Right. Let's say, for example,
I like this type. Okay, great.

611
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,120
You've selected

612
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,720
this type of wood for me to go ahead
and let's say peruse the table.

613
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,720
Okay. A week passes by, right?

614
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,800
And then I give a call to my customer
and be like, Hey, by the way,

615
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,080
these are the legs.

616
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,840
They're looking green color
or let's see a blue color, right?

617
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,400
Or would you like to change them?

618
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,440
Or what do you feel like about this?
Right.

619
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,240
Let's say the customers say,
you know what, I think I don't like this.

620
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,760
I think I would rather have blue
color, let's say legs for this.

621
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,840
Let's say table right now.

622
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,120
Okay, No problem.

623
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:00,440
Okay.

624
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,800
So now because they wanted some changes.

625
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:03,400
Okay.

626
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,240
Just letting you know
that is going to take

627
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:08,640
instead of two weeks,
it might take two weeks and three days.

628
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,480
Now because of, you know, let's
say some changes going on that you want.

629
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,720
Okay, Let's say two weeks and three days
passed by.

630
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,360
Now, remember this.

631
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,240
You talked to the customer a few times.

632
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,840
You got some feedback. Right.

633
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,200
And by the way,
I know we're not going to charge too much.

634
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,760
The bill will charge you $230 instead
of, let's say, 200,

635
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:32,160
all which was previously because we spent
additional three days customizing the.

636
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,640
Now, would you as a customer, rather

637
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:39,240
pay 30 bucks
more and get exactly what you want?

638
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,800
Or would you rather pay $200 and start

639
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:46,160
from all over scratch?

640
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,560
Majority customer will pay $30 extra.

641
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,440
And yeah,

642
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:54,360
it costs a little bit more though, but
they get exactly what they want, right?

643
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:59,120
Because you got involved
with the customer, you involved them

644
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,360
and basically got their feedback
and made changes.

645
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,480
Now the customer's happy,
cannot say anything they way

646
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:09,120
you didn't build this according
to my specifications and we do great.

647
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,960
So think of that now as agile, right?

648
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,560
That is what Agile is.

649
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,960
You got the customer involved,
you got the feedback.

650
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:20,280
Even though DEADLINE got pushed back
from two weeks to two

651
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,480
and a half, let's say,
and it cost a little bit more.

652
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:28,840
But the end result is very different now
in Waterfall, if, let's say, for example,

653
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:32,800
the $200 that you all paid for
the let's see the table

654
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,680
and you hate it completely,
they got to start all over.

655
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,600
It might cost $300 additional or 200 more.

656
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,120
Right?

657
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:44,840
So this is a good way to compare how Agile
and Waterfall is, just the involvement.

658
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:48,800
On a very basic level.

659
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,800
Does it make sense, guys?

660
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,320
Continuous improvement.

661
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,520
Agile. Okay. All right.

662
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:57,600
Yeah, I'll try to break it down
in a non-technical way.

663
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:01,960
Get the picture and then you will see less
related to the tech war, right?

664
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,520
So let's break down exactly what is agile.

665
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,920
Let's look at that bookish in definition,
right?

666
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,600
Let's see.

667
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,200
Agile able to move quickly.

668
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,760
Everyone knows that easily.

669
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,040
I t definition Agile is a time boxed
iterative approach

670
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:19,640
to software delivery
that builds software incrementally.

671
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,040
The key word is incrementally

672
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,560
from the start of the project
instead of trying to deliver all at once.

673
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,040
So just look at this picture here.

674
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,080
This a big rock
and we have pebbles, right?

675
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:35,520
Rather give small pebbles to the customer
instead of giving a major

676
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,440
big rock at the very end right?

677
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,680
So when we talk about Agile,
we're doing this.

678
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,680
And the very important thing to listen to
is a time box, the term approach.

679
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,120
What does that mean
is that you build the stock

680
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,120
or the
the product in small amount of deadlines,

681
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,160
let's say in a very small timing,

682
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,040
which I'm going to explain to you
in a little bit, a little bit more detail.

683
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:56,640
Right.

684
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,640
Agile came as a solution

685
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,600
to the disadvantage of Waterfall became

686
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:07,400
instead of a sequential process,
Agile was an incremental approach.

687
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,040
We remember it's doing everything.

688
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,080
We still see what is doing it on a very,
very small scale.

689
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,200
Instead of spending two months,
six months, seven months

690
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,160
is developing this
following all the processes of SDLC.

691
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:24,600
But in a short amount of time
the teams start off

692
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:28,080
with a project design,
then begin to work on small modules.

693
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:28,600
Right?

694
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:32,040
The module is done in weekly
or monthly sprints.

695
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,400
I'm going to clear what the word is sprint
and the end of each sprint.

696
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,520
The project priorities are invalid
and tests are run.

697
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:42,360
So when we talk about now Agile,
right in Agile

698
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:46,280
we say if a project needs to be done
in specific sprints,

699
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,520
what we mean by sprints
is basically the timeline, right?

700
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:54,200
So a software, you cannot build the entire
software, let's say in one year, right?

701
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,840
So you have to break that one year project
into sprints.

702
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,800
By sprints we mean is is a time
frame is the time frame, right?

703
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:05,800
When we say one week sprint,
that means the software

704
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,400
is some part of
the software needs to be built in one week

705
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:14,400
and then customer needs to be sure
what's built, get feedback, etc., etc..

706
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:18,520
So in Agile
there's only four type of sprints,

707
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:23,360
one we expect two week sprints,
three week sprints or four weeks.

708
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,680
It depends on the companies right?

709
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,200
Basically
when a company says that we're going to do

710
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,120
we have a two week sprint,
that means everyone is given

711
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:35,840
the task for two weeks
to be completed by that specific deadline.

712
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:39,600
So the following Friday in two Fridays
is basically

713
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:43,200
when we're going to be finished and
then we're going to get our customer well.

714
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,840
So remember the word sprint.

715
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,880
If it's more than four weeks,
you know, it's not really agile.

716
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,040
When we go to
when you guys go to real time companies,

717
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,360
you will see companies
with either do one week or two weeks.

718
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,480
One week is a little too fast,
I would say.

719
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,240
But there are companies who do one week.

720
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,240
A lot of times you will see
two week sprints in three weeks sprints.

721
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,240
That means that, you know,
you will have two weeks

722
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,920
to do all the work,
do the coding, development, everything

723
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:12,480
and you need to will be finished
within the deadline of two weeks.

724
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,200
If you don't finish in that day,

725
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,160
you know, you have to
then finish that at a following sprint.

726
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,840
So what happens after the sprint is done?

727
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:23,160
Guys, you have to show what the customer,
what you have

728
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:26,360
develop in those two weeks
and get that feedback right.

729
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,520
The same way I gave you the table example.

730
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:32,400
So remember this
everything is done in Springs.

731
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:37,320
Now one thing is whenever you join
a project, great, tomorrow are

732
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,680
the sprint time.

733
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,440
Do you think they change
or they remain consistent?

734
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,440
What do you guys think

735
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,000
know?

736
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:56,040
So if, let's say the company says
we're going to follow Agile methodology

737
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,720
and we're going to build this software,
let's at the very beginning

738
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,360
we're going to follow a two week
sprints cycle basically.

739
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,880
No, it won't.

740
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,480
Basically the entire project

741
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,480
will go on to experience
for the entirety of the project.

742
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,720
It never changes.

743
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:13,840
It doesn't mean that first, let's say
two weeks, you guys did all the projects.

744
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:17,160
Now company has decided to do three weeks
or one week.

745
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:21,520
No, whatever they said from the very
those are the schedule.

746
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,200
They're going to go on
for the entirety of the project.

747
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,840
So remember this the sprint is consistent.

748
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,080
It never changes.

749
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,960
So if your company is doing a three week
sprint,

750
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,880
they're going to do three weeks
for the entirety of the project.

751
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,520
They're not going to be doing one.

752
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,440
Let's say one sprint is three weeks.

753
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,480
Next Sprint is four weeks.

754
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,840
The following is five weeks.

755
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:45,080
No, never, no, there's no flexibility
in there in that sense, actually.

756
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,000
And remember,

757
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,880
if they're doing five weeks, six weeks,
they're not really following Agile.

758
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,240
Now, one thing, remember this Agile,

759
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:57,320
what I'm going to explain to you
is the what we go through in details.

760
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:01,320
These are the rules that needs
to be followed to do in the Agile way.

761
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,080
But remember, a company can change.

762
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,880
They can come up with your own rules.

763
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,000
Remember that?

764
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,320
What if they can finish
in a specific frame?

765
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,400
Good question this year, if they can.

766
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,800
Finishing that for sweeping

767
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,480
that test needs to be completed
in the following sprints.

768
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,520
They can finish it.

769
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,240
They can be easy

770
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,480
and I'll show you what happens in
and how we play around with this.

771
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,200
But it has to be if they finish, yes,
they go up, though.

772
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,080
It goes back to the backlog, which
we're going to cover in a little bit.

773
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:31,000
It goes back to then.
We worked on it at a later time, too.

774
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,000
So now if we

775
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,040
look at these sprints,
allow for bugs to be discussed in fixed

776
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:40,560
the customer feedback is in Co Inc before
starting next sprint.

777
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,040
So you see a sprint is done in two weeks.

778
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,360
We got some feedback,
we showed what we've done.

779
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,600
Maybe customer didn't like what we did.

780
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:52,360
They can add changes and those changes
will be implemented in the next round

781
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:55,560
of work, let's say of two weeks,
which would be, let's say a sprint

782
00:40:55,560 --> 00:41:03,800
right.

783
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,920
Okay, I got it.

784
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,320
I got your idea. What you mean.

785
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:11,400
So remember this, You're working
hand in hand with developers.

786
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,440
So let's say you have a two week
sprint, right?

787
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,080
The developer might be coding,
you'll be waiting on that whatever tasks

788
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,200
you're assigned or working on. Right?

789
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,760
You waiting on them to finish.

790
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:24,000
Meanwhile, you might do other work
to see you work hand in hand.

791
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:28,760
Let's say it's the last week and two days
left and the developer hasn't finished.

792
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,080
What you're supposed is this.

793
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,400
This is something you bring up
then in the media.

794
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,360
Hey, I have only this amount of time left
and I'll talk to you about the meetings

795
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,040
and things like that.

796
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,000
A little bit later

797
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,640
we'll make a little bit more sense to you,

798
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,520
and I kind of show it to you as well, too.

799
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,520
But yet use a
you don't just wait on the developers.

800
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,000
You work hand in hand.

801
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,640
Companies
do change a little bit sometimes, but

802
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,320
you work hand in hand basically.

803
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,360
So this is agile.

804
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:56,280
Now, one thing just to game to agile
makes sense already.

805
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,320
Probably, probably already
think that is awesome, but

806
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:02,360
there are some pitfalls to it as well too,
which we will cover in a little bit.

807
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,880
But before I get into this too,
what is the manifesto of Agile?

808
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,920
Just to got to give you a little bit
of background of what Agile is Agile.

809
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:14,640
As I said, you know, in the Agile
process started even from Toyota

810
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,200
in the early 1960s, but in 2001,

811
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:22,200
a lot of these top developers,
people, influential people

812
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:26,320
from the industry of software
development, tech world, they gather up

813
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:31,040
and they came up with this idea of agile
right in this meeting,

814
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,360
an idea basically these,

815
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:36,120
you know, profound
people who are influential,

816
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,960
they basically came up with the idea
that, hey, instead of

817
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:43,080
what are the things we can change,
they compared it to waterfall, right?

818
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:47,320
What are the things that we can change in
how we can make the process better?

819
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:51,680
So individual interaction
or comprehensive?

820
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:55,400
One thing I didn't mention too much the
but in waterfall

821
00:42:55,560 --> 00:43:00,240
there is a ton of unnecessary
documentation maybe to someone

822
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:04,160
they might think it's important,
but there's a lot of documentation

823
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,760
and a lot of paperwork
whenever you're doing a waterfall project.

824
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:12,120
So their idea was like, Look, we shouldn't
focus too much on documentation.

825
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,200
Instead, we should have more interaction

826
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,960
within team members
and basically maybe the client as well. To

827
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,560
the end goal should be basically more

828
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:26,720
of a working software than again,
more of exhaustive documentation.

829
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,640
Why the reasoning?

830
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,920
By the way,
documentation is heavy in waterfall?

831
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:34,080
Because look, in waterfall
the projects can be for five years, right?

832
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,760
Or four years. Right?

833
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,000
Every phase
everyone wants to secure themselves

834
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,560
the design phase wants to do
all the documentation, everything.

835
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,040
Hey, we did everything right.

836
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,360
We did everything accordingly.

837
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,320
They develop mean testers.

838
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,680
They do a lot of these unnecessary

839
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:51,000
documentation,
which I'll talk a little bit later on.

840
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,600
They make all of these documentation

841
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:56,440
because later on when the project
and you know, you have all the paperwork

842
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,720
and everything there to show the customer,
Hey, we did everything right.

843
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:05,120
So there's more of that in the customer
collaboration versus look at this

844
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:09,960
with nego contract negotiation
in Waterfall, when a project ends,

845
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:10,400
let's say

846
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,760
you want to make changes and everything,
you kind of have to write another contract

847
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:17,680
for me to do all the changes you want
and probably pay me a little bit more

848
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,360
money, right?

849
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,800
So that's what they want.

850
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:23,640
Responding to change
then following a direct plan, basically,

851
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:27,600
meaning if boosting technology,
let's change, adapt

852
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:31,120
instead of whatever we set in stone
in a contract, we must go buy this.

853
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,120
Right? That is not the approach.

854
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:38,640
So this idea came in early 2001
and from there on is when we start seeing

855
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:44,280
more agile slowly coming into the software
development industry, basically

856
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,520
less document is

857
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,280
more meetings, definitely
a little bit more meetings in here.

858
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,360
So let's look at some things
when to use adjust

859
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:57,760
when there isn't a clear picture
of what the final product should be.

860
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:00,160
This is very important, guys.

861
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,520
Remember when I showed you that picture
of requirement gathering and everything?

862
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:07,520
A lot of times, guys,
when the customer seems uncertain

863
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:11,400
or doesn't really know
it is the best process

864
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,200
to use or the best methodology to use,

865
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:18,200
because with the feedback and everything,
you know, you kind of get

866
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:22,080
what the customer want
when there's really a big picture.

867
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,240
Now this is also very important.

868
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:28,440
I'm going to clarify this
when rapid production is more important

869
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:32,120
than the quality of the product,
and I'll give you some examples

870
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,080
so you'll understand this one.

871
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,680
Clients will be able to change

872
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,960
the scope of product
when rapidly changing standards.

873
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,080
Okay, so what does it mean?

874
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:40,840
What do you guys see

875
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:45,440
when rapid production is more important
than the quality of the product?

876
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:46,040
What do you mean?

877
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:49,240
What do you guys think? Why?

878
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:53,520
This is very important to understand this.

879
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,600
What happened in HP

880
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,960
when they want to beat the game?

881
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:01,600
Look, it's also very important
to understand in the current world.

882
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:04,760
Let me give you some good example
so you kind of get the big picture.

883
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,920
Okay, release product
and fix bug on the way.

884
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,920
Yes, that's the way to look at it.

885
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:10,880
Let me ask you this.

886
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,040
Microsoft, Apple, all of these companies,

887
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:18,800
do you guys think they're waterfall Paul
or IBM or Amazon or they're Agile?

888
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:24,000
Which one do you guys think?

889
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,520
Agile. Right.

890
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,200
You're able to say Agile now.

891
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,000
Why do you think they're agile?

892
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,880
What makes you think why do they or not?

893
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,040
Waterfall in more of an Agile approach.

894
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:38,080
What what do you guys think?
The reason it's

895
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:41,480
competitive, there's a lot of,
there's a lot of competition, you guys,

896
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:45,480
a lot of competition and technology's
changing all the time, right?

897
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:46,920
Think about this way guys.

898
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:51,640
Still, if Apple was not competitive
with, let's say, Android, the changes

899
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:55,080
in everything, releasing so many things
every time you would fall behind.

900
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,920
Let me give you a very good example. Okay.

901
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:02,440
On the app stores, for example,
for companies that are very,

902
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:04,480
you know, let's say
Uber or Lyft or whatever,

903
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:08,040
when you see those negative reviews,
let's say the one star reviews

904
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:13,240
and everything, do you think they care
about those reviews?

905
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:16,040
They do companies
that are more agile, right?

906
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,680
They actually care about you
because your customer is telling you

907
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,640
this is not working right, blah, blah,
blah.

908
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:25,240
It's a Why do you guys see
so many updates to an app?

909
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,840
Have you ever understood this?

910
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:31,160
A lot of times there's a lot of bug fixes,
a lot of things that customers

911
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:34,160
want an improvement
rate feedback has been given.

912
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:38,160
You see all the time
there's an update available for

913
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:42,600
for your phone or some apps and everything
because through that updates

914
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:46,360
they are changing this things still,
if they're not going to be

915
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:50,440
competitive guys, these guys,
they're going to die out for example.

916
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,360
Then when we talk about competition,

917
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:56,400
let's talk about something
you guys majority we can relate to, right

918
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:58,040
In the world

919
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:01,040
of social
media, Instagram was a picture app

920
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,240
and then something came
like Snapchat stories and everything.

921
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,720
Right now, Instagram, Facebook owned,

922
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,640
they wanted to compete with Snapchat
and they want to destroy them.

923
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,000
And what did they do?

924
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,200
Does anyone know what they copied?

925
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,240
The story mode, right?

926
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:20,000
They copied the stories from basically

927
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,080
from Snapchat, the exact copy of it.

928
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:24,000
Now, why did it?

929
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,160
Because look, guys they're in competition.

930
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:32,240
You have, let's say, ability to user using
Instagram and then let's say Snapchat.

931
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,160
I had about 200, 300 million user.

932
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,400
Now with the new it's

933
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:40,520
you can call it copying and everything,
but you know, they were competing.

934
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:43,680
They were like, Hey, if we want to
stay relevant, we want to succeed.

935
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,920
We need to copy kind of
and come up with a similar things.

936
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:50,240
Now, when we look at it
in the current market, they're not focused

937
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:55,080
on even, let's see, Snapchat
now they're competing with Tik Tok.

938
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,480
No one but Tik
Tok is going to come out of nowhere

939
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,760
and they're going to become
such a massive thing.

940
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:03,120
Now, officially, Instagram announced
that they are no longer

941
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:06,120
a picture based software or app.

942
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,200
They are more of a video app.

943
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:11,360
So now their new thing is reels, right?

944
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,960
So you see competition is killing
these guys.

945
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,800
They have to be up to date.

946
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:21,240
If the real software or the real
feature of Instagram is not doing

947
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:24,800
well, people are going to jump on the Tik
tok right along the competition.

948
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,800
For them to come up with these changes

949
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,880
all the time, they can not swallow
Waterfall guys.

950
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:34,560
Absolutely not possible
if they're going to waterfall

951
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,080
waterfall methodology, they're done.

952
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:38,520
So they do.

953
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:41,760
A lot of these companies are fast paced
because keep in mind

954
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:45,600
there's a lot of competition, but
at the same time they want to be relevant.

955
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:49,800
If you want to be relevant
and be ahead, you have to adapt, guys.

956
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:50,920
You have to adapt.

957
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:53,480
Look at companies that did not adapt.

958
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:56,320
Nokia, BlackBerry, outdated, right?

959
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,560
Outdated. They dig.

960
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,720
They completely got destroyed.
They should have.

961
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,520
When Apple came up
with a touch on the issue of Oprah,

962
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:07,800
they should have launched something very
similar right away to be in the market.

963
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:08,640
Right.

964
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,320
But see, that's one thing to understand
the big picture.

965
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:15,600
So for companies like this,
why this is important in coming

966
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:19,360
back to the point when rapid production
is more important than the quality.

967
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:23,800
Because for companies, think about
the original Facebook, how it look versus

968
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:27,840
how it looks now, it's important
for the companies to put the product out

969
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:31,040
and will fix it along
the way, will improve it,

970
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,680
but we need it to be out there
because there's a lot of competition.

971
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:38,320
So main goal is to bring
something, develop and put it out.

972
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,280
We will fix it. Over
time, bugs will be found.

973
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,160
This in that customers will tell us,
Hey, what's wrong

974
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,960
or what needs to be fixed right?

975
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:50,480
So for a lot of these agile based
companies, you know, that's what they do.

976
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:54,760
They want their product to be out there
instead of waiting five years

977
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,520
or a few years back.
You know, it's not the right approach.

978
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:00,760
So quality is not important.

979
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:04,880
More of the speed of it is more
important here when it comes to Agile.

980
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:08,760
Maybe now it'll make sense
why a lot of these companies

981
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:11,840
don't care too much about the quality
at the beginning.

982
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:15,440
Of course they care about the quality,
but they want to be out there first

983
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:19,080
because too much competition technology
is changing and they can change it.

984
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:22,440
If you're looking for perfectionism,
it's not going to happen.

985
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:25,080
You know, it's just not going to happen.
You waste more time.

986
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:27,280
You need to be out in the market first.

987
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,320
That's what we talked about.

988
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:32,520
The evolution of technology has to be
because so many things are changing.

989
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:37,120
If we don't stay up to time,
you become obsolete and outdated, right?

990
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:41,440
No. Look at big companies are blockbuster
Kodak, all of them.

991
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,640
BE We're not keeping up
with the competitors.

992
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:46,520
Maybe their approaches were wrong
or whatever they were doing.

993
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,400
That's why they're gone.

994
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:54,720
Larry So this tells us basically why Agile
focuses more on the rapid production.

995
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:58,080
And a lot of times, like I said
over at the beginning, when there isn't

996
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:01,760
a clear picture, a lot of the customers
don't know what they want. Read

997
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,760
I remember how Facebook used
to be different.

998
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:07,320
Absolutely. Absolutely.

999
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:11,160
Now, advantages of Agile
guys allow for changes.

1000
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:14,400
Agile allows for changes to be made
after initial planning.

1001
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,680
Changes can be made per client request.

1002
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:20,560
Basically, look, the client is paying you
millions of dollars.

1003
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:23,040
They have the see to change things
any time they want to.

1004
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:27,720
Sometimes it can be very back
to the project that I'm talking about is

1005
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:33,520
when I was working with HP
and we to go with our to our USPS client.

1006
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,240
Man, those guys were idiots.

1007
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:38,520
I'm sorry, but those guys were not smart

1008
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:43,360
about the managers or the people,
like I said, who were in charge.

1009
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,440
They were making changes every two weeks

1010
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:49,800
like crazy, like whatever we built,
and they were scratching out.

1011
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,000
Of course, HP is not going to care.

1012
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,240
They're getting millions of dollars,
but developers will sometimes get

1013
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:58,680
basically a little discouraging,
like what in the world?

1014
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:01,320
But remember,
the client is being millions of dollars.

1015
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,400
You got to listen to what they want.

1016
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,400
If they can make up their mind,
that's their thing.

1017
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:10,280
But at the end day,
you're pleasing the client here. It's

1018
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:15,200
so very important to understand.

1019
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:19,280
At the end of each sprint
project, priorities are evaluated.

1020
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:23,520
The client can add their feedback for the
next sprint to get their desired product.

1021
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,920
That means whatever was built basically
within two weeks

1022
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,440
will be showed to the client.
They don't like it.

1023
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,120
No problem.

1024
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:32,400
Okay, we'll change it if it costs more.

1025
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,320
Whatever it is.

1026
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:35,040
Now remember, this client is happy.

1027
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,160
They're getting what they want.

1028
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,880
Sometimes it can become a little costly,
but at the they're,

1029
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:44,120
you know, satisfied testing completed
at each testing at the end of each sprint

1030
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:47,280
sure that the bugs defects are caught
and taken care

1031
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:51,360
that means we are building this product,
big product piece by piece.

1032
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:54,240
Right. And we do testing
and development on each piece.

1033
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:54,960
We're not waiting for

1034
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:59,000
the entirety of the product to be finished
and then doing testing, very big.

1035
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,160
Important to release product
at the end of the cycle.

1036
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:06,240
Product is launch
at the end of each cycle, all the testing

1037
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:09,720
and development is completed
before going to production. Now

1038
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,080
technically they can launch the product
after two weeks if they want to.

1039
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:17,800
Let's say they made a login page
or a home page where they can launch it.

1040
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:22,280
Companies tend not to launch everything
after the end of the sprint.

1041
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:23,640
They technically can.

1042
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:26,840
They will combine couple of streams,
so it's a more of a bigger picture.

1043
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:30,080
But they technically can launch it
if they want to.

1044
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:30,480
Right.

1045
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:33,840
So understand that that by end of that
two weeks, if everything's good,

1046
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:36,960
this product can go live meaning
it can go on.

1047
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:40,880
WW W and what our website is,
it can show up over there.

1048
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:44,720
Customers might not launch it
right after two weeks, but they had

1049
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:48,520
big can basically any sprint one week,
two weeks, three weeks, four weeks,

1050
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:51,200
they usually come back. That's usually the

1051
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:55,440
the trend,
but they can do it if they want to.

1052
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,200
Now let's look some disadvantages.

1053
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:01,720
There are some disadvantages.

1054
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:02,720
We actually sorry,

1055
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:03,480
I think there's still a

1056
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,160
focus on advantages

1057
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:09,000
I thought we go to the additional
advantages again are people interaction

1058
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,160
that we looked at the agile manufacturers
face to face conversation regular

1059
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:17,560
adaption to changes in circumstances
and late changes is welcome.

1060
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:21,600
So this advantage
now this can be basically so basically

1061
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,160
every speed is going through SDLC.

1062
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:27,520
Yes, basically UI at the beginning

1063
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:30,760
they're more involved design phase,
but they kind of phase out later on.

1064
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:35,000
But yes, basically requirements
that they're all the things are happening

1065
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,120
in that small sprint, small little one
on a very small portion basically.

1066
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:41,520
Now there are some disadvantage, right.

1067
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:45,840
Less importance to given to design
and documentation that does happen.

1068
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:50,640
I like I said, design gets a little bit
not as much utilized

1069
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:54,600
maybe at the beginning of the project,
but later on their use of design does not.

1070
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,320
But documentation.

1071
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:59,080
Documentation can be good,
but sometimes it can be bad

1072
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:00,880
if you don't have too many right.

1073
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,080
Unclear requirements
leads to a messy project.

1074
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,400
This is very important.

1075
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,280
Unclear client requirement.

1076
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,760
You need to do a messy project.

1077
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:11,640
Remember
Agile said that Hey, it's more for people

1078
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:14,760
who have no idea what they want,
will work with them.

1079
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,760
The same example I gave you, right?

1080
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,000
My our client us

1081
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,840
because they didn't know what they
so they would make changes all the time.

1082
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:26,240
Now that can sometimes lead to messy
project, right?

1083
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:29,840
Because the client doesn't know
or their expectations are something else.

1084
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:32,480
They wanted something else
and they do not communicate.

1085
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,560
Sometimes it can lead to a messy project.

1086
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,520
It can become very confusing.

1087
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:40,680
Remember,
we are in Agile, a client pleasers.

1088
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:41,640
That's what we care.

1089
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:44,280
As long as the client is happy,
will do whatever they want.

1090
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:46,680
But sometimes the clients can be idiots

1091
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:50,520
if they don't know what they want
and they making the changes a waste.

1092
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:51,760
A lot of time and money.

1093
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:54,000
But at the end of day
they are aware of this.

1094
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:58,400
So there are some pitfalls to that,
to bigger and complex projects.

1095
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:01,840
Difficult determine
the effort estimation at the beginning.

1096
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:02,840
What does that mean?

1097
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:06,360
Is that, look, when the client
is not very certain of what they want

1098
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:10,800
and they are not sure, it's kind of hard
predict that, hey, this project

1099
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:14,880
will be done in one year or two years
because, look, they can be very

1100
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:17,440
they can they

1101
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:21,000
they might not have an idea
if they unsure of what they want.

1102
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:24,200
It can turn out to be a very long project

1103
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,480
because they think
the of their professional.

1104
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:31,440
Yes decision.

1105
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:35,280
Well remember for every company
you go at a higher rate let's say

1106
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:39,120
let's say you work at a bank
who makes the decision the teller makes it

1107
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:42,920
or the bank branch manager rate
more like it The branch manager, right.

1108
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:43,960
Let's say for example.

1109
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:46,880
So the same thing, of course,
they will listen to

1110
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:49,600
the people developer tester, but

1111
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:53,120
remember project managers, product owners,
you learn some of these titles.

1112
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:57,320
Now they're the one making the decision,
but of course they'll have a conversation

1113
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,840
within the team.

1114
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:01,960
But at the end of day, priority,
same thing applies into

1115
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,720
when we go into I.T.

1116
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:06,600
You have managers director
so me those people,

1117
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,320
they're the one who makes the decision.

1118
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:12,760
So which one do you guys think
is better now?

1119
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:15,520
Now that you have an idea of

1120
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,680
waterfall and agile or

1121
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:20,760
will you be agile?

1122
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:24,720
But the key to deciding which matter it
comes down to the context of the project.

1123
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:25,680
Remember this.

1124
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:26,760
This is very important.

1125
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:29,120
If it's going to change rapidly,
choose Agile.

1126
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,760
If you know what exactly
you need, choose waterfall.

1127
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:35,600
So if you really look at it
guys though it again it comes down to

1128
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:39,120
what what
the project is, who the client is. Yes.

1129
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:43,640
In reality, if you look at it, Agile
looks a lot better and it can be better.

1130
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:47,440
But keep in mind,
Waterfall is not a bad methodology.

1131
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,760
It just only works in a specific scenario.

1132
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:53,400
It works better in specific circumstances.

1133
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:57,000
So it comes down really there to that
for government waterfall, for private

1134
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:02,400
sector agile, that's typically the case,
but also depends on the client.

1135
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,440
Can you do an agile waterfall?

1136
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,080
Catalina Absolutely.

1137
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:09,200
That is a great, great way.

1138
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:12,680
Notice you do
you remember this company's remember this.

1139
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:18,040
They do not follow all the time
100% of agile or waterfall.

1140
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:20,880
They can mix and match,
they can add things in it.

1141
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,960
I usually I made up my own words.

1142
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:26,720
Some companies all exaggerate,
which is like

1143
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:29,640
they have some things from waterfall,
some things from Agile.

1144
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:32,040
This happens all the time too.

1145
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:33,120
So remember this.

1146
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:36,960
Some companies I've seen where they have
two month sprints.

1147
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:40,920
Well, if we follow exactly Agile

1148
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:44,560
what it's supposed to be, there's
no such thing as eight week sprint.

1149
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:47,520
We only have 1 to 3 or four companies
do that.

1150
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:51,480
The project that I said was I was on
that was more of a waterfall

1151
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:55,200
and agile combination
because we did not really finish on time

1152
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,320
and things like that.

1153
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:58,680
So companies can mix and match.

1154
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:01,280
And remember, this is very common as well.

1155
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:02,880
Two companies have,

1156
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:06,800
they can come up with their own terminal,
they can do whatever they want to.

1157
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,520
These are just best practices out there.

1158
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:12,840
If you follow this way, you will be
successful and you will know how to

1159
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:15,360
basically handle a project.

1160
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:16,320
Can things change?

1161
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:20,040
Can they add things to it
that are not part of Agile Waterfall?

1162
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:22,520
This absolutely they can do
is their project.

1163
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:24,040
Whatever they want to do.

1164
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:26,200
They could add terms
that we have never heard of.

1165
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,880
You might go to a company where let's see
today we clarify some terms.

1166
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:31,840
We'll have a completely different term
for that.

1167
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:34,160
Well, they came up on their own right?

1168
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:38,520
So that is very possible.

1169
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:40,200
All right. Does it make sense?

1170
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:45,800
Are we clear on Agile
that we have a bigger picture somewhat.

1171
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:46,920
All right, perfect.

1172
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:47,640
Perfect.

1173
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:50,520
Now, of course, we're going to
break it down a lot more in-depth.

1174
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,800
But before that,
let's look at the project failure rate,

1175
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:59,280
Waterfall and Agile Failure and Success
Project Failure.

1176
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,720
Look at this guys.

1177
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:06,400
Waterfall on a smaller projects,
11% failure in their medium

1178
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:11,000
sized projects, about 25% of projects
fail.

1179
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:12,360
It's a big chunk.

1180
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:13,840
Large project, of course.

1181
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:19,200
Absolutely we're talking about 42%
projects fail there on waterfall,

1182
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:22,440
especially those billion dollars
projects that I talk about.

1183
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:25,880
There are a lot of these you guys know
Obamacare project that I said

1184
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:30,000
that was one point something I'm
not sure was an agile, a waterfall,

1185
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,040
but it was a big project
that failed, right?

1186
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:34,720
So big project, huge risk.

1187
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:40,280
When we combine all of this, we are
what add we got what, 2070?

1188
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:44,800
We have 78%, 78%.

1189
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:46,560
Guys, that is a high

1190
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:50,320
percentage of projects failing overall.

1191
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:54,440
But if you look at it,
Agile is not like bulletproof.

1192
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:56,720
There is some fairly here smaller one.

1193
01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:00,760
We have 4% medium to medium
project 11 and 23%.

1194
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:04,360
Look, that's still a decent high
number, 23% project four.

1195
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:07,800
So it's not like, you know, again,
I want you to just understand this.

1196
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:13,080
A lot of times maybe the the project
philosophy or methodology could be great.

1197
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:17,160
But again, if your management is horrible,
it's going to is going to end up

1198
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:18,600
basically failing.

1199
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:19,840
So there can be a lot of

1200
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:24,440
reasons for the failure, but
we get a better idea of project failure.

1201
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:25,160
A lot of times

1202
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:28,680
the bigger projects tend to fail
and a lot of the government projects

1203
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:32,880
we talk about numerous,
you guys can research it, lots of project,

1204
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:38,200
millions dollars, 100 million, $200
million projects failed miserably because

1205
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:42,240
sometimes they follow the waterfall
methodology, they have bad management.

1206
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:44,280
So many things can be basically set

1207
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:47,040
calendar.

1208
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:48,400
All right.

1209
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:52,840
So that's just to kind of give you an idea
of what Waterfall

1210
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:56,040
Agile success ratio is now

1211
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:59,160
what we're going to do.

1212
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:00,000
Yeah, exactly.

1213
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,360
Eugene That is a still a high percentage
if you look at it.

1214
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:09,400
But remember, again, there can be
multiple factors or why a project fail.

1215
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:13,480
Now Agile to remember
is the big word Agile methodology,

1216
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:17,760
but not agile
have different versions of Agile.

1217
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:25,400
Okay So what we're going to look into
now, sorry, it comes down to again,

1218
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:26,640
remember that it comes down to

1219
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:30,800
who makes the decision at the same time
depends on the project.

1220
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:31,440
It's up.

1221
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:32,400
A lot of companies,

1222
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:36,480
like I said, still are using waterfall,
especially on the government side.

1223
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:38,520
There's not really make sense.

1224
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:42,160
But keep in mind
what you know here, I guarantee you guys

1225
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:45,480
enjoy the people out there
in the management in let's say government

1226
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:48,080
agency don't know this
that I can guarantee you this.

1227
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:49,360
I remember this.

1228
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:51,320
You guys are learning a lot of things
right now.

1229
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:53,840
A lot of people don't know these things.

1230
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:55,920
By the way, this is a harsh reality.

1231
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:58,040
But when you go to the real world,
you'll see that.

1232
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:59,720
And you might not believe me today,

1233
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:03,360
but when you get to see and work
with government, private sector,

1234
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:06,520
you see things that makes you like,
why is this really happening?

1235
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:07,680
But you will see that

1236
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:10,280
can the client choose the method?

1237
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:11,360
Absolutely.

1238
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:15,720
They can do that. Yes.

1239
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:18,160
Can the client also change in between?

1240
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,680
They could also depends.

1241
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:22,800
It really depends
maybe on the contract basis,

1242
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,640
but again, it comes down to remember this.

1243
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:29,240
This game is all about making money,

1244
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:29,600
right?

1245
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:32,600
So one company like HP
wants to make money.

1246
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:34,040
The other one was giving money.

1247
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:36,200
Remember,
government is a printing machine, right?

1248
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:40,920
So remember these these these choosing
of which methodology happens.

1249
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:43,040
It comes from the very top, right?

1250
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,600
It comes from the very top.

1251
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:47,000
And they're the one deciding all of this.

1252
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,600
Now, let's not get straight track.

1253
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:51,680
We have a lot to cover today, Agile.

1254
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:57,680
So when we talk about Agile, by the way,
there are different versions of Agile.

1255
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:00,720
The best way to look at it
this way, it's ice cream.

1256
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,680
Ice cream has different flavors, right?

1257
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:04,880
We have chocolate, vanilla, strawberry,
everything, right?

1258
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:07,200
We have different flavors of ice cream.

1259
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:10,600
So agile is ice cream
and agile is different.

1260
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:15,600
Flavor can be scrum, bon, Bon Scrum,
Bond priesthood, extreme programing.

1261
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:19,400
All of this, the most popular 70%

1262
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:22,600
of the companies used Scrum.

1263
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,000
That is the most popular.

1264
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,160
We're going to focus on Scrum today,

1265
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:29,840
which is the most popular one
basically to use.

1266
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:31,000
So look at this.

1267
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:35,280
Remember Agile, the big word under that
umbrella, you have different flavors.

1268
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:37,360
And one of them is Scrum. Right?

1269
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:41,160
When we talk about this,
why so many different flavors

1270
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:42,560
or different version came?

1271
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:44,840
It came all from this meeting
at the beginning.

1272
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,880
Remember, everyone came up with the idea.

1273
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:50,240
Some will have meetings, someone have less
meeting, they'll do things.

1274
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:52,600
The whole process, do things fast.

1275
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:55,320
But these ideas
by these different people came

1276
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:58,320
and some of them came
with a different version of Agile.

1277
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:02,120
And now we look at there's actually
more than the one I'm showing you.

1278
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:07,160
There's actually lean Agile
now there's scale Agile.

1279
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:08,880
Geez, there are so many of them right now.

1280
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:11,560
But the most popular one,
like I said, is Scrum,

1281
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:14,880
and we're going to strictly focus
on this scrum and Kanban.

1282
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,680
Another version of Agile

1283
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:20,880
has little bit less meaning, very similar,
but some changes.

1284
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:24,400
I don't know because once you're
a Scrum master, which you'll know

1285
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:26,960
later on what it is,
you will know all the different one,

1286
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:29,160
but we'll focus strictly on Scrum.

1287
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:32,360
But remember there are
so when you go to a company, right,

1288
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:36,600
someone asks you which methodology
your company use, you can say

1289
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:38,560
you have to say Agile scrum.

1290
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:40,120
Don't say just Agile.

1291
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:42,120
I just come by defining it.

1292
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:43,720
Okay. The company followed this.

1293
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:46,600
Like I said, 70% of the companies
follow Scrum,

1294
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:49,760
so we'll focus strictly on Scrum.

1295
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:50,400
All right.

1296
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:54,840
Make sense, guys.

1297
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:56,640
All right, Perfect.

1298
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:58,520
We can move forward now.

1299
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:00,680
I'm going to basically funny names.

1300
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:01,320
Yeah.

1301
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:04,400
I'm not really sure who comes up
with these names of the common bonds

1302
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:06,120
from extreme programing.

1303
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:06,600
To this day,

1304
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:10,200
I still don't know what in the World
Extreme Program is, but it's a version.

1305
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:11,360
I have no idea.

1306
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,920
I could care less
because I have not seen anywhere

1307
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:20,360
or someone using this,
but they might be single companies.

1308
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:21,640
Scrum is a framework.

1309
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:27,680
Yes, that is one
of the frameworks of Agile.

1310
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:29,800
I want to see the scrum on and everything.

1311
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,280
Maybe they're similar.

1312
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:33,120
I don't know why the name came with there.

1313
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:36,960
There's some changes in there,
some some changes in there.

1314
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:39,240
You have to do
a little bit of research on that,

1315
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:42,920
but they're all of them
have a lot of similarities

1316
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:47,680
and there's some differences too.

1317
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:47,920
Yeah.

1318
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:50,960
So Scrum
is also following the rules of Agile.

1319
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:53,600
Now you see, guys,
what I'm going to show you right now

1320
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:56,680
within Agile, we have certain things,
some people, right?

1321
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:59,480
Product owner, Scrum Master,
we're going to look in all of that,

1322
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:01,840
let's say in the scrum barn or something.

1323
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:03,960
Maybe you might not have
some of these meetings, right?

1324
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:07,680
So they're all very similar
with some differences.

1325
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:09,720
Agile is there guys?

1326
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:11,880
Agile is the philosophy.

1327
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:15,720
The practice in implementation
would be of that Agile

1328
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:20,240
philosophy will be Scrum, Kanban, Scrum
Barn or any of those other one.

1329
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:23,640
The actual implementation is Scrum Kanban

1330
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:27,720
or any of those and 70,
like I said, is using scrum

1331
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:32,840
and Agile is the big picture
the philosophy of how it needs to be done.

1332
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,880
That's what we looked at this picture
right at the beginning,

1333
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:39,120
the Agile Manifesto, right,
what it should be.

1334
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:40,880
And then in the implementation

1335
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:45,040
they came up with the different flavors,
different version of Agile.

1336
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:50,120
Does it make sense guys?

1337
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:51,320
All right, perfect.

1338
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:55,080
Okay, so now what we're going to do,
we're going to slowly break it down

1339
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,840
and we learn Scrum. You will learn it.

1340
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:01,080
So it might be a little bit
too much knowledge today, but we'll see.

1341
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:04,200
Now, this is Agile.

1342
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:05,840
Let's see how it is.

1343
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:07,640
I'm going to just show it to you.

1344
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:10,560
But this is exactly what happens in Agile.

1345
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:12,280
You can take a look at it

1346
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:16,920
for a minute or so, see if you understand
what in the world is happening.

1347
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:19,920
Any idea you will understand
after I'm done with everything.

1348
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:24,760
But let's see if you guys get understand.

1349
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:28,120
Does it look complicated?

1350
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:32,320
Yes or no? Yes.

1351
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:33,080
No. Kind of.

1352
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:34,640
Okay. Yes. Okay, It's fine.

1353
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:36,640
And so what I first show this,
everyone gets scared.

1354
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:38,960
So it's really not complicated at all.

1355
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:42,360
When we break it down step by step,
all of this

1356
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:45,560
is going to make sense to you,
is going to make a lot of sense to you.

1357
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:47,560
But right now, it looks very complicated.

1358
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:48,520
If I were to look at it

1359
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:51,120
and I didn't know anything about it,
I would be freaked out, too.

1360
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:54,440
But don't worry,
I'm here to explain this step by step.

1361
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:54,720
Right.

1362
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:57,080
Working as

1363
01:09:57,080 --> 01:10:02,320
are we going to use two different software
for testing this and all the same.

1364
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:06,360
You mean like different testing to now
you should stick with one or whichever

1365
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:07,040
it is, though

1366
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:09,720
you might have different tools
and things like that, but you stick with

1367
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:12,160
the ones
the company wants to hire you for.

1368
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:15,040
Okay,
so now what we're going to do is look,

1369
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:18,440
Scrum is an Agile framework
for completing complex training.

1370
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:22,840
It is applied to any project
or product effort right now.

1371
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:24,600
Basically, we're going to break down

1372
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:28,680
exactly what happens in the day of,
let's say, of

1373
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:31,680
Scrum framework, of Agile.

1374
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:32,760
Let's say

1375
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:37,960
I ensure we're going to get to that right
now, the backlog part, right?

1376
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:41,640
So it's divided into three
different modules.

1377
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:47,200
You can set rules, artifact
and semi rules are basically the people,

1378
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:50,560
right, who are involved in this agile.

1379
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:52,720
Remember,
like I told you at the beginning,

1380
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:56,640
for some reason, I don't know why,
but they make complicated.

1381
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:58,840
They come with it terms and lingo.

1382
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:00,800
So that's why some people get confused.

1383
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:04,920
Basically are the people who are involved
when we talk about artifacts

1384
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:09,400
are some very important elements of agile
that makes it very special.

1385
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:11,640
So we're going to
look at basically break down

1386
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:14,960
what does product backlog split in backlog
burned out charts

1387
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:18,920
are that we work with all the time
ceremonies, right?

1388
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:21,600
Ceremonies.
It's a fancy word for meetings.

1389
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:23,760
That's the best way to put it.

1390
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:27,000
Meetings, All of these spring grooming,
spring planning, spring review,

1391
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:31,840
all of our different meetings that happen
when you an agile environment, right.

1392
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:33,720
But they call it ceremonies.

1393
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:36,360
Don't ask me
why how they came up with no idea

1394
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:38,960
they could have just called meetings
but they didn't right

1395
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:41,720
So what we're going to do
is we're going to break down

1396
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:45,440
each and every one of them,
and I'll actually show you real life

1397
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:48,240
right here,
which I'll show you guys in a little bit.

1398
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:50,640
In JIRA, how it looks like, Right.

1399
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:51,840
How it really looks like.

1400
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,880
So you
will get the real picture of how it is

1401
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:59,040
and how you work will be basically
a distributed and how you do the work.

1402
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:01,280
Right.
So we got to basically break it down.

1403
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:04,800
We see top guy right now is product owner.

1404
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:08,760
Who do you think a product owner
in this Agile scrum

1405
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:13,760
framework would take A wild guess.

1406
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:20,240
It can be the client.

1407
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:25,800
Have you guys ever
heard of Project manager?

1408
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:29,680
Yes, Right now in a
what are we going to Agile?

1409
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:32,280
We don't use terms like Project manager.

1410
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:33,360
They don't exist.

1411
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:34,400
Maybe they will.

1412
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:36,160
Some companies mix and match,

1413
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:39,480
but basically that's
what the product owner in Agile is.

1414
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:44,640
Look defines the item in the product
backlog, which I'm going to explain to you

1415
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:48,160
or manage project features and release

1416
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:51,280
to optimize our clients,
that kind of thing.

1417
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:52,000
Great.

1418
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:55,640
Or why Return of investment
dealing more with the client, right.

1419
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:56,880
They are the one.

1420
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:59,400
Remember that
they're the top dog for this project.

1421
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:02,240
They're the one who are communicating
with the customer.

1422
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:06,440
They're the one dealing with the customer
what they want, doing all that

1423
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:10,520
they can remember business analysts is
just a person that might do the paperwork.

1424
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:13,120
But remember this
when we get into the tech world,

1425
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:14,880
you have hierarchy as well too.

1426
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:17,160
Just like you would go to a bank,
you have teller,

1427
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:19,760
you have a finance person,
you have a bank manager, right?

1428
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:24,960
So in the same way in the tech world now
we have an individual who is responsible

1429
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:28,480
for the success of this entire,
let's say, project Great.

1430
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:31,040
That individual is product owner.

1431
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,040
He is the decision maker.

1432
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:36,840
One person
defines items in the product backlog,

1433
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:39,160
which I'm going to explain to you
a little bit and show you.

1434
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:43,000
That means they are the one who can see
what we need to work,

1435
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
what things
we don't need to work on. Right.

1436
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:49,920
Prioritize feature
according to user and stockholder needs.

1437
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:53,800
That means after having conversation
with the client, let's see.

1438
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:57,520
So let's say from HP,
let's say I was a product owner.

1439
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:01,400
I had a conversation
with the other stakeholders and everyone

1440
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:04,800
from, let's say the client said
the top management, whatever they want,

1441
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:08,280
I can prioritize guys
after talking to blah, blah, blah.

1442
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:12,240
Joe you know they want this feature go,
So let's work on this.

1443
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:16,200
They're doing
can change of feature and priority

1444
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:20,520
or every spring that means they can move

1445
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:23,120
things around in a spring
what needs to be worked on,

1446
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:27,160
what needs to be not worked
on, what can be worked at a later time.

1447
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:29,000
We don't need to work on it.

1448
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,800
Accepts
or rejects work from the development.

1449
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:35,120
They can say, Hey,
what are we built right here?

1450
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:37,920
I don't like it. Developer
You spent two weeks on this thing.

1451
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:39,960
What we did? No, not good.

1452
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:43,080
This is not what the client want
to scratch all of this, We can start over.

1453
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:45,520
So remember that they are the big boss.

1454
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:46,760
They are the top guys.

1455
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:48,720
They are the one who talks to the client.

1456
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:49,920
They're the one meeting

1457
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:54,640
while they do all the jobs of basically
what a business end is supposed to do.

1458
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:56,360
But let me explain this.

1459
01:14:56,360 --> 01:15:02,520
Now, this gets a little tricky in reality
when we talk about Agile, right?

1460
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:08,040
Agile Scrum or any of them, the title
business analyst does not exist in this.

1461
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:12,120
It's more of a waterfall thing,
but a lot companies,

1462
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:15,120
I would say
probably 90% of them has a title

1463
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:18,160
someone called Business
and who gathers all the requirement.

1464
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:22,040
Actually
the person who's supposed to be agile,

1465
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:25,920
who is supposed to do all that paperwork
and get all the documentation

1466
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:28,200
is supposed to be a product owner.

1467
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:31,480
And the product owner
does that to gather the requirements.

1468
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:34,920
But a lot of times, like I said, 90%
you'll see in companies

1469
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:38,160
they will have a business analyst still,
even though

1470
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:43,200
it's not technically part of Agile, but
you will see that in almost every company.

1471
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:44,920
So don't be surprised by this.

1472
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:48,040
But they are technically
doing all the job of also

1473
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:51,440
what a business and is does,
but they the big boss.

1474
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:54,560
So usually
they don't do a lot in some companies.

1475
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:58,000
Maybe the product owner will work
on those requirements and things do.

1476
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:01,720
But a lot of times business analyst is
with them, they're doing all the things,

1477
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:03,360
but they shouldn't be doing that.

1478
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:07,080
But anyway, just to so you know,
from the real world, that's how it works.

1479
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:08,960
Does it make sense?

1480
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,160
Do we understand what a product

1481
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:15,360
owner does?

1482
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:16,840
Nobody can fire you.

1483
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:18,960
Product owner can do that.

1484
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:21,960
Remember, they're in charge
of the success of the project.

1485
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:26,360
They're the one communicating with the,
with the clients, whatever.

1486
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:29,520
Now, one thing, guys, one thing,
just to make it a little bit

1487
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,080
does the job of buyer.

1488
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:35,640
Yes they're supposed to they might not it
remember that they might not do this

1489
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:38,880
so they're supposed to
some of them do actually do this.

1490
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:41,360
One thing can happen sometimes.

1491
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:42,360
Sometimes.

1492
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:46,080
By the way, in some projects
the product owner can come from

1493
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:50,680
the client side and be the one in charge
to have supervision over that.

1494
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:52,200
That can happen sometimes.

1495
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:57,400
So instead of, let's say the product owner
from HP goes over there

1496
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:59,600
to, let's say, talk
to, let's say the client,

1497
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:03,480
maybe sometime the client can pick
a product owner, hire and be like, hey,

1498
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:07,960
have oversight, sit at Hewlett-Packard
in an office and watch

1499
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:10,000
and do the things that can happen
sometimes.

1500
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,520
Do remember this.

1501
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:15,480
A lot of times it's, not usually
the client side bring a product on.

1502
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:18,520
Is the company that's building
usually have their product order,

1503
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:21,360
but it can happen to you
when you go to real world,

1504
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:25,760
you might sometimes see that I have
some may explain that product orders from

1505
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:30,120
supposed to be from the company we are
but it's the other way that can happen.

1506
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:32,280
It just doesn't happen too often.

1507
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:37,320
So just be aware that when you go to the
we will sometimes things are a little off.

1508
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:38,440
It can happen, right?

1509
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:42,280
But yeah, they're the one
usually controlling the project,

1510
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:45,360
the one communicating,
guiding the requirements and everything.

1511
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:48,480
And meanwhile
they have a system to help them out,

1512
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:53,000
but technically
they should be the one doing it.

1513
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,320
They're the jack of all trades.

1514
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:56,520
Well,
they're the business people, remember?

1515
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:57,800
They're the top manager.

1516
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:01,840
Remember one time, by the way, guys,
a product owner does not have be

1517
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:06,080
P or is product ownership.

1518
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:08,720
People?

1519
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:12,240
Yeah, a product owner does not have to be
that technical, by the way.

1520
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:14,400
You don't have to be there.

1521
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:15,400
Good communication.

1522
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:18,720
They have some certifications
and things and management though.

1523
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:22,040
Maybe you work in I.T
or maybe you have in some time,

1524
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:24,040
let's say a project manager, right?

1525
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:25,920
Some of them are technical, some are not.

1526
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:29,080
Meaning they might not need to coding
and things like that.

1527
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:31,360
Their job
is basically the business need to be.

1528
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:36,160
They're working more on the communication,
making sure the client is happy etc.

1529
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:37,840
so getting all the things from them.

1530
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:41,280
So this is the product order
that is basically,

1531
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:44,400
for example about the fish

1532
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:48,600
eye issue.

1533
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:51,120
What is your question, by the way?

1534
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:54,000
I wouldn't
say Michael, it's the easiest job

1535
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,880
because one thing I can tell
you, product owner is always busy

1536
01:18:57,880 --> 01:19:00,960
in meetings in 8 hours,
probably 5 hours, 6 hours.

1537
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:02,880
They have meetings, depends on projects.

1538
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:04,800
So they could be listening to the client.

1539
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:06,320
This is not all time.

1540
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:08,240
Sometimes it can be later adding to.

1541
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:12,400
I remember that the product owner that we
had in my project, he was sick and tired.

1542
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:13,680
He's like too many meetings, right?

1543
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:14,440
So it depends.

1544
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:17,720
Remember, sometimes they can be easy,
sometimes it can be a little bit

1545
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:21,600
overburdening.

1546
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:25,080
For me, it's still not clear who
the product which part of it is not clear

1547
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:25,720
to you.

1548
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:29,320
Asia get stuck in an issue in which
what are you not getting?

1549
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:33,600
Product owner is the think of it
like in waterfall or something.

1550
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:36,120
Project manager
Someone who controls the project.

1551
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:37,640
A manager. Right.

1552
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:41,040
When you go to a store, for example,
let's say you go to a CVS raid.

1553
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:44,280
See there's, there's a manager
who hires fires

1554
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:47,120
people, tell people what
time to come to work, everything right.

1555
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:48,280
He's the big boss.

1556
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:50,320
He controls that store, for example.
Right?

1557
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:51,960
The same way in I.T.

1558
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:56,040
Product owner is that top level management
who is in charge of this projects?

1559
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:57,600
That is the person.

1560
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:59,760
He's the head of the project. Absolutely.

1561
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:01,240
Does that make sense?

1562
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:02,000
I don't mean Jody.

1563
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,320
We got it, but I want to make sure
I actually got it too.

1564
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:06,360
He is your boss. Yes.

1565
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:08,280
He or she is your boss.

1566
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:10,160
They're the big boss, right now.

1567
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:15,200
Underneath them
there is another person, Scrum Master.

1568
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:20,160
Now we're going to learn a scrum Master's.

1569
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:21,880
Yes, that's correct.

1570
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:25,160
So then under the

1571
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:29,760
product owner is an individual
called Scrum Master.

1572
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:32,760
Now these guys okay, ensure scrum

1573
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:36,680
is fully functional, improves quality.

1574
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:38,560
Who is Facebook peer?

1575
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:40,920
Who knows?
They have thousands of projects.

1576
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:43,880
So within internally they have it.

1577
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:47,760
Remember, guys, a company
could have multiple projects, right?

1578
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,840
Multiple hundreds of project.

1579
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:52,200
It doesn't mean
that I'll give you an example.

1580
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:58,200
When I was in HP with the PAC Enterprise,
one of the project just in my floor,

1581
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:02,920
we were maybe two aisles of Cubicle
and that was our UPS project.

1582
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:06,480
The aisle next to us
was Department of Defense.

1583
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:08,240
There was Army, there was Nasser.

1584
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:10,440
There could be thousands of projects,
remember that?

1585
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:12,080
And each project alone

1586
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:16,560
can have a team of product owner Scrum,
master developers, all of that.

1587
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:17,200
So don't get it

1588
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:21,120
confused that it's one person
that controls the whole company, Right.

1589
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:26,800
Just to make sure that you understand
this.

1590
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,920
And there will be a lot of projects
out there.

1591
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:31,600
Sometimes you might work
on two different projects.

1592
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:34,520
That means maybe
you have two different product owners

1593
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:35,400
because you might be

1594
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:37,720
working on this project
and they might need you there too, right?

1595
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:42,480
Yes. Paul is only in charge
of a certain project.

1596
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:46,600
Yes, that's correct.

1597
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:48,480
Can the product order be change one?

1598
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:51,560
They can absolutely be fired
if they're not doing the right work.

1599
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:52,680
Absolutely.

1600
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:53,640
It all depends.

1601
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:55,800
Yeah. Okay.

1602
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:59,160
So now we know what a product
or a top tier guy does.

1603
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:01,880
All that communication
is with the business thing. Guy.

1604
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:03,400
There's the requirements as well to

1605
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:07,920
we will
have those creating 1 billion roles.

1606
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:10,480
We are part of the development team,
which I'm going to explain.

1607
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:14,040
Okay, so now we know
product one underneath there's individual

1608
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:15,440
Scrum Master.

1609
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:19,720
Okay, this is important to understand
ensure scrum is understood in enacted.

1610
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:20,960
Okay, I'll explain to you.

1611
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:23,840
We should use the team
for external interviews,

1612
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:27,920
communicates to product owner and team
does not make decisions for the team.

1613
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:32,400
So a Scrum master is basically now
a supervisor.

1614
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:33,480
Think of it this way.

1615
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:37,320
Remember a manager you have in a
in a store or a branch, let's say,

1616
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:41,600
and then underneath you have someone call
a supervisor or a coordinator, right?

1617
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:45,840
A supervisor usually does
not fire you, hire you mostly manager,

1618
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,480
but make sure everything is working
fine. Right?

1619
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:51,960
Because remember, the top boss
is not going to come at the very bottom

1620
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:53,040
to talk to someone, right?

1621
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:54,960
They have remember this in it.

1622
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:56,640
We have hierarchy as well,

1623
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:58,960
product owner, Scrum Master,
and then the team right there.

1624
01:22:59,000 --> 01:22:59,400
Right.

1625
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:02,480
So yeah, you can look at that
as assistant manager,

1626
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:05,600
but not really are
let's say a coordinator, right?

1627
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:08,680
So now what
The job of the Scrum Master is,

1628
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:12,800
their job is basically to see, hey,
develop.

1629
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:15,760
Are you good, Are you falling behind?

1630
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:17,120
Is something wrong?

1631
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:20,440
Like why are you not finishing the work
or whatever rate tester?

1632
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:21,200
Are you good?

1633
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:23,920
Is everything. Let's see.
You have a complaint, for example.

1634
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:26,920
Hey, I want to raise
or let's say I want to do something right.

1635
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:29,040
I think I'm
not going to be finished on tap.

1636
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:31,920
You don't go directly to that
topic, to the product owner.

1637
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:34,240
Let's see, I'm a developer. Some. Right.

1638
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:35,400
You don't do that.

1639
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:39,360
You would bring up your concern
to, let's say a Scrum master and Scrum

1640
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:43,320
master will be the one takes it
to, let's say for example, to the product

1641
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:48,720
owner Scrum Master also at the same
time is the one now in the team, right?

1642
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:51,760
Remember product owner
could be always sitting at the client side

1643
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:55,880
doing the meeting Wahoo in the back end
where the development is happening

1644
01:23:55,880 --> 01:23:58,800
to keeping track of everything. Right.
Are we on time?

1645
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:01,200
Are you following
are we going to finish in two weeks?

1646
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:01,840
Right.

1647
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:04,360
Basically that's going to be the scrum
method.

1648
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:06,480
Their job,
they don't have to be technical.

1649
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:08,480
They don't have to be doing any of that.

1650
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:13,000
What their job is, making sure,
everything is going accordingly, smoothly.

1651
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,640
Are we finishing on time?

1652
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:15,760
Do you have any problem?

1653
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:18,200
If you have any problems,
you bring it to Scrum Master

1654
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:20,320
and they'll try to find a solution
for you. Right?

1655
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:22,520
They're Also the one. Yes.

1656
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:24,760
They are supervising the team. Absolutely.

1657
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:27,840
They're also the one who runs
all the meetings.

1658
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:30,560
So all the meetings,
a Scrum Master run them.

1659
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:31,080
All right, guys.

1660
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:34,560
So we're going to have a meeting,
blah, blah, blah. Mr.

1661
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:35,720
Whatever developer.

1662
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:37,880
What did you work
on? Yes, you're okay. Blah, blah, blah.

1663
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:41,400
Remember, they cannot fire you,
they cannot hire you.

1664
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:44,760
They cannot tell you what to do,
but they can supervise

1665
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:46,920
what's going on, coordinate
what's going on.

1666
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:48,120
You have any problem?

1667
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:50,080
You have too much work.
You falling behind.

1668
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:52,200
You don't just call this a product owner.

1669
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:54,240
You talk to the Scrum master.

1670
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:55,920
They're the middle person. Remember?

1671
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:59,560
They're the very middle person
who is overseeing kind of everything,

1672
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:03,960
running all the meetings, are making sure
everyone is aligned, finishing deadline.

1673
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:07,880
If there's any problem things either
let's say I'm stressed out or something,

1674
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:10,080
I'll be the one talking to a Scrum master,

1675
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:13,520
not to the product owner,
because one is at the very top, right?

1676
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:16,320
The Scrum Master Nguyen Coaching.

1677
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:18,600
We just supervise the Scrum Master.

1678
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:21,880
A lot of times
I've seen some business analyst

1679
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:24,840
becomes Grand master,
but they don't have to.

1680
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:29,880
They absolutely don't need to know
any code or anything like that.

1681
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:30,720
They're the co-hosts.

1682
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:37,240
Yeah, Yeah.

1683
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:39,160
They don't have to know any coding.

1684
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:43,800
They don't have to be very knowledgeable,
the technical side.

1685
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:45,720
But they need to have people skills.

1686
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:48,480
They need to know how to work
with people, right?

1687
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:53,160
They want
they have to be good in communication.

1688
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:54,960
They need to understand how things work.

1689
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:57,720
They need to keep the team
motivated at times.

1690
01:25:57,720 --> 01:26:02,040
Remember, a lot of times Scrum Master is
always like a motivator too, by the way.

1691
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:03,640
Right? They're doing all right, guys.

1692
01:26:03,640 --> 01:26:05,160
They would add games to it

1693
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:08,160
to make the work easier,
basic, make it more flexible.

1694
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:08,400
Right.

1695
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:12,840
And their work is I would say Scrum
Master is a little bit easier.

1696
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:13,440
Yeah.

1697
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:17,720
So this is what they do it again
at the end of it.

1698
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:23,760
You have to remember,
don't make any decision whatsoever.

1699
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:25,680
They have knowledge of the scrum.

1700
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:27,760
They're the one involved in this. Right.

1701
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:30,000
They're the one handling all the meetings.

1702
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:33,040
They're checking up,
see are you falling behind?

1703
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:35,280
They're checking all the schedule
and everything.

1704
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:39,240
So they definitely have the knowledge,
but they don't need to have knowledge

1705
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:41,760
of how software
is need to be done. And manage.

1706
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:44,760
It doesn't need to know, for example,
how you do coding.

1707
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,200
This is got to know their Hey,
do you know how to do this?

1708
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:49,800
Can you get it done? That's
what management does, right?

1709
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:53,160
They're not really management,
but they're like supervisor.

1710
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:56,400
They don't want to be a scrum master
In the future.

1711
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:57,720
You can be

1712
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:03,080
who does the job of appeal
when they're absent.

1713
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:07,520
A lot of times, if in the company there's
a business analyst, they could do it.

1714
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:10,440
Sometimes a Scrum master it all depends.

1715
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:15,280
Dubbed the product owner can delegate
responsibility to a scrum measure

1716
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:18,320
or let's say, for example,
a business analyst,

1717
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:22,160
business analysts, you know,
they kind of know what's going on there.

1718
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:23,320
The one communicating to.

1719
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:26,640
So sometimes they are the better fit
the more than a scrum

1720
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:30,040
master because Scrum masters
really the one talking to the client.

1721
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:30,520
Right.

1722
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:32,760
Business analyst and product owner,
they are the one

1723
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:41,680
anyone who is in project
implementation process.

1724
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:45,040
Most yeah. Majority of people do. Yep.

1725
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:50,520
Are we clear on
what the Scrum master does?

1726
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:51,840
They are your supervisor.

1727
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:54,920
You bring your problems, anything to them
and they all start

1728
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:57,920
checking our
we on time finishing in our sprint.

1729
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:00,000
Remember you have two weeks sprint. Right.

1730
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:02,880
So they're going to be looking
just to Hey, are you guys good?

1731
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:05,440
Why are you falling behind
or you're falling a little bit behind.

1732
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:07,400
Okay,
let me get you some work or something.

1733
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:09,760
Let me talk to a developer,
Whatever it is they do.

1734
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:12,480
And remember, they run all the meetings.

1735
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:15,640
They are the one running majority
of the meetings sometime prior quarter,

1736
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:18,000
but majority times
they are the one I remember.

1737
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,160
Coordinator slash supervisor.

1738
01:28:20,440 --> 01:28:23,480
That's the easiest way to look at it
without confusing it too much.

1739
01:28:23,480 --> 01:28:23,880
Right?

1740
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:27,400
So now we know who the product owner is,
who the Scrum master is, right?

1741
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:29,240
So should take a break.

1742
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:31,440
Okay, let's finish one
and then we'll take a break.

1743
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:35,280
Okay then in the in the in the Agile
world scrum,

1744
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:38,320
then we have something called development
team.

1745
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:42,000
When we talk about development,
it does not mean just developers.

1746
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:45,040
It means basically testers

1747
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:49,440
and developers or programmers
and business and designer, all of them.

1748
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:51,520
So we come under this.

1749
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:53,600
Now we are the development team.

1750
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:56,280
We call ourself cross-functional team.

1751
01:28:56,280 --> 01:29:00,840
So developers are their testers
are they are maybe are designers.

1752
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:04,920
They our business and as they come under
the development team now

1753
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:09,160
select the spring goals
and specify workers will explain that.

1754
01:29:09,160 --> 01:29:12,360
I'll explain
exactly what this is in the later slides.

1755
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:14,240
But basically remember this

1756
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:17,840
we are the one who are doing all the work,
everything is

1757
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:21,960
basically testers and developers
are part of the development team,

1758
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:25,160
demonstrate spring result to

1759
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:28,480
product order meeting the development
tester and developers.

1760
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:31,120
Whatever they build,
they show it to the product owner.

1761
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:32,000
This is what we created.

1762
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:35,120
This is the software that we created
in the last two weeks or three weeks.

1763
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:36,760
Whatever it is, we manage it.

1764
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:40,520
It's something sprint backlog,
which I'll explain to you in a little bit.

1765
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:44,440
Yeah, the real workers,
the real work is the developer,

1766
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:47,560
which is testers,
developers, business and designer.

1767
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:50,200
These are the real guys.
These are the real heroes.

1768
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:51,760
We are the labor class.

1769
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:54,720
Put it this way,
We are the workforce of the software.

1770
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:56,440
That's the best way to look at it.

1771
01:29:56,440 --> 01:30:01,360
We without us, the builders, nobody can do
anything without testers and developers.

1772
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:02,520
The project is a fail

1773
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:06,720
because you won't have anything to show
they are the construction workers, right?

1774
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:07,800
They are the guys.

1775
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:10,560
We are the guys who develop everything.

1776
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:14,160
Because you so remember
the development team can be anywhere from

1777
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:18,360
this is what, 6 to 3 year
can be 6 to 7 around damage, right?

1778
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:19,160
We are the builders.

1779
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:22,200
Yes, they are the one design
the spring goals

1780
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:24,960
in work, which I'll explain to you
in a little bit in the later life.

1781
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:29,160
So remember we clear
what product owner is, what Scrum Master

1782
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:33,000
and the development team
who who are part of the development team

1783
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:36,840
and just reiterate and then we won't break

1784
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:39,600
us us mean who testers

1785
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:43,920
and who else developers to programmers
let's say programmer

1786
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:48,840
let's say software engineers, testers,
business analyst, designers right.

1787
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:52,520
Let's see this now comes
and this as a development

1788
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:56,440
team. Yep.

1789
01:30:56,680 --> 01:30:58,960
So all the real workers right now.
All right, guys.

1790
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:02,280
Now next up, we're going to have,
of course, more terminology.

1791
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:04,800
We're going to clarify what this picture.

1792
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:05,960
But let's do this right now.

1793
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:10,560
Let's take a 15 minute break and then
we'll get back and then we'll get started.

1794
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:12,600
Remember to remind me to record.

1795
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:14,400
All right, guys, I'll pause right now.

1796
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:15,360
Come back.

1797
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:16,720
What is it, 834.

1798
01:31:16,720 --> 01:31:20,280
So come back at 850, please.

1799
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:21,240
Any questions?

1800
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:22,600
By the way, before we go?

1801
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:27,760
Any confusion, anything so far?

1802
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:29,440
Not clear. Okay, great.

1803
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:29,760
All right.

1804
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:30,160
Perfect.

1805
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:34,240
I'll pause right now
and then we'll get started at 850 here.

1806
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:37,160
I watch some some highlights.

1807
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:41,080
And anyone watch the Ufa Japanese game,

1808
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:45,480
by any chance?

1809
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:45,800
Yeah.

1810
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:48,520
There you go, Jimmy.

1811
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:48,920
There you go.

1812
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:52,000
That Renaldo score goal at the end, Right?

1813
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,600
Just the highlights.

1814
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:56,120
Barca lost three zero.

1815
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:57,320
Interesting.

1816
01:31:57,320 --> 01:31:59,560
Very interesting today

1817
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:03,040
yesterday as we're going to
I don't know how many soccer fans we have

1818
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:05,880
but it's a nice a nice game today.

1819
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:07,320
All right.

1820
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:09,120
Anyway, let's get back to it.

1821
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:12,520
So now let's see, where did we left off?

1822
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:14,680
We covered what product order was. Wait,

1823
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:17,240
what is product going to do?

1824
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:28,520
What did they do?

1825
01:32:28,520 --> 01:32:32,000
Is the head of the project
great manage the product backlog.

1826
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:34,200
They're the one who can change
the features.

1827
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:36,400
In fact, they're the big boss Absolutely.

1828
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:40,200
They do everything or the betas and more.

1829
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:42,560
And that's a good way
to look at it. To Project lead. Yep.

1830
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,480
We don't use project manager in

1831
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:51,960
in what's that in an agile scrum
but kind of what they do

1832
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:56,040
they might do a little bit more
but still then we Scrum Master.

1833
01:32:56,040 --> 01:33:00,480
What do Scrum Master do.

1834
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:01,920
Who was manager.

1835
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:05,160
They're the supervisor aide
They're the one who are basically

1836
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:08,840
giving you the guidance
and things that they can.

1837
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:10,360
They tell you what to work on.

1838
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:14,680
By the way.

1839
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:16,000
No, they don't.

1840
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,600
They don't have that part
and they hire and fire you

1841
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:22,800
know, they can do any of that.

1842
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:25,480
They they have no decision making power.

1843
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:27,040
Remember that.

1844
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:30,880
What if you have any problem, anything,
anything have,

1845
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:35,520
you can basically bring it
to the scrum master and they will be.

1846
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:38,120
Yeah, they're the messenger between,
let's say

1847
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:41,080
the product owner and the team.

1848
01:33:41,080 --> 01:33:42,720
Basically they're the middleman.

1849
01:33:42,720 --> 01:33:45,240
And the other one,
they're also running all the meetings.

1850
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:47,120
They're the coordinators. Right.

1851
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:48,480
They will try to inspire you.

1852
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:50,000
I saw someone say that right?

1853
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,000
They try to make it.

1854
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,280
You know,
everything is fun and everything.

1855
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:55,840
You know, all of that stuff.
That's their job. That's what they do.

1856
01:33:56,120 --> 01:33:57,760
They like the interaction.

1857
01:33:57,760 --> 01:34:02,120
So let's just look at this and
the last one we had, the development team.

1858
01:34:02,120 --> 01:34:04,640
Who's in the development team.
When we talk about development team,

1859
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:08,240
6 to 8 people to really

1860
01:34:08,240 --> 01:34:13,920
be testers, software developers, designer,
most likely know all of this.

1861
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:15,960
Maybe architecture,
you can put them in there.

1862
01:34:16,640 --> 01:34:20,800
But when we look at this picture,
guys, let's look at this picture, right?

1863
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:22,920
Product owner, right.

1864
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:25,040
Who are they talking to?
The business owner.

1865
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:27,800
That means someone who gave them
the project, say, for example,

1866
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:30,280
they're also talking to the end user,
right?

1867
01:34:30,280 --> 01:34:31,760
Let's say and use it.

1868
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:35,120
Product and business
owner are from the client side.

1869
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:36,680
For example, people who use it,

1870
01:34:36,680 --> 01:34:39,480
they're the one you see,
they're the communicator, right?

1871
01:34:39,480 --> 01:34:41,360
They're the one who communicate, use.

1872
01:34:41,360 --> 01:34:44,520
You don't see the arrow down over here
or the Scrum Master.

1873
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:48,480
No, they're basically doing all the stuff
of what a bay is supposed to

1874
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:51,480
do, basically, but had more, for example.

1875
01:34:51,480 --> 01:34:52,400
And they are the lead.

1876
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:55,280
Basically,
a business analyst cannot find hire you,

1877
01:34:55,480 --> 01:34:59,280
but a product owner can do that.

1878
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:02,240
Product owner is not really a contractor.

1879
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:05,520
They're just the more
the head for the business from, let's say,

1880
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:09,360
this team who got hired to talk
to the other team who they're building

1881
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:10,200
the product for, right.

1882
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:13,960
Like I said, sometimes
the roles of Scrum Master right here

1883
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:18,240
manage this can process remove impediments
let's say any problems

1884
01:35:18,240 --> 01:35:21,960
anything comes along
they're the one who you bring it up to.

1885
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:24,040
They will take care of it,
for example. Right.

1886
01:35:24,040 --> 01:35:27,000
And this is the development
you see Dev created that dev

1887
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:33,160
you have architect business
analyst can be someone else as well to.

1888
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:35,600
Yes. They're the one
controlling the project, right.

1889
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:39,960
They're the one, you know,
who is communicating to the client.

1890
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:40,520
They are the one

1891
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:44,160
because look, remember guys,
the Q8 cannot call the client right here.

1892
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:45,280
They can't do that.

1893
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:47,320
They they're not going to,
of course, in a meeting.

1894
01:35:47,320 --> 01:35:50,400
Sure they can, but they don't
have the interaction right away there.

1895
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:53,080
Or Scrum Master
does not go to the end user or something.

1896
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:55,760
Someone from the team
has to be the representative.

1897
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:56,280
Right.

1898
01:35:56,280 --> 01:35:58,920
Who can speak, let's say,
on behalf of the project

1899
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:03,280
or get good feedback for the project,
whatever it is, basically

1900
01:36:04,440 --> 01:36:05,480
controlling the project.

1901
01:36:05,480 --> 01:36:09,560
Yep, they might work on budget,
sometimes they might work on

1902
01:36:09,560 --> 01:36:11,160
some of those things as well too.

1903
01:36:11,160 --> 01:36:13,280
And that's what a project or product
owner does.

1904
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:18,720
So do we understand what the whole
Scrum team and how how it looks like?

1905
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:21,240
Who the people going to be involved.

1906
01:36:21,240 --> 01:36:23,360
Does it make sense now when you go to work

1907
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:26,160
and let's say you're in an agile
environment, you know,

1908
01:36:26,160 --> 01:36:29,880
just remember product owner, Scrum Master,
that's what it is.

1909
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:32,320
The development team, all of those.

1910
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:33,720
So pretty straightforward.

1911
01:36:33,720 --> 01:36:35,000
Now these are the players.

1912
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:38,040
When we talk about an Agile scrum,
these are usually the thing.

1913
01:36:38,280 --> 01:36:41,400
Let's say
you are, for example, in a waterfall,

1914
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:42,920
you won't have a scrum master.

1915
01:36:42,920 --> 01:36:46,040
They don't believe in
waterfall, does not have a scrum master,

1916
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:47,880
it will have a project owner,

1917
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:51,160
so say project manager,
but they want to have a scrum master.

1918
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:53,480
They might have, let's say,
some other titles.

1919
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:57,120
You might have a manager or developer
might have a development manager.

1920
01:36:57,120 --> 01:37:00,400
They all have different titles
and roles like there.

1921
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:03,760
But when you look in an Agile scrum,
this is what we have right here.

1922
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:06,280
What you see here in the picture basically

1923
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:08,920
slowly coming

1924
01:37:08,920 --> 01:37:12,800
together and trust me,
if it feels a little bit who's domain

1925
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:16,360
expert and agile
domain expert can be someone, let's say,

1926
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:18,560
who for example,
from the client side, right?

1927
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:19,640
Someone let's say.

1928
01:37:19,640 --> 01:37:22,600
Let me give you an example
of what I work for.

1929
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:23,920
Let's see.

1930
01:37:24,240 --> 01:37:26,280
When we used to talk
to. Let's see. Whoops.

1931
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:31,080
Eusebius individual, a domain expert,
for example, from the end would be

1932
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:35,840
someone who worked, let's say for 30 years
at post office or they know so much.

1933
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:38,880
Domain expert means are people
who are who have been there

1934
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:41,920
for the longest from the beginning to end
and they literally

1935
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:45,280
can be anyone but someone who's been
with that company or someone.

1936
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:46,800
So you want to pick their brain.

1937
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:47,560
Let's say we're building

1938
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:50,840
a new project, new software,
and we know from the end user

1939
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:54,560
are someone who is experienced person
who's been there for 50 years

1940
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:56,160
with, let's say, this company.

1941
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:59,720
We want to talk to them because their
opinion matters, because they are the one

1942
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:03,960
who knows exactly
what's going on in that industry hands on.

1943
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:06,520
So they could be literally anyone,
you know.

1944
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:09,600
So you talk to those domain
and that's basically

1945
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:12,200
what the product owner will do,
maybe talk to them.

1946
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:16,360
And I remember we used to have meetings
where we would talk to individual

1947
01:38:16,360 --> 01:38:20,640
who were from exactly directly from post
office, very senior officials, you know,

1948
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:24,640
who've been there for a very long time
because we were building a software

1949
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:29,520
for postmen and, you know,
post office staff and individuals, Right.

1950
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:33,320
So we wanted someone from there,
someone very experienced who can also

1951
01:38:33,320 --> 01:38:34,560
give us some idea.

1952
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:38,400
The Scrum master looks at lonely out
there.

1953
01:38:38,640 --> 01:38:39,440
Well, it's not that.

1954
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:42,600
It's just because they're
they're not the technical person.

1955
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:44,560
They're not really developing anything.

1956
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:46,440
They're not firing, hiring anything.

1957
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:48,240
So they're on the side basically.

1958
01:38:48,240 --> 01:38:51,120
You know, I just supervising.

1959
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:54,880
That's what they're doing right.

1960
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:55,480
Okay.

1961
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:58,440
So we covered now all the roles work

1962
01:38:58,720 --> 01:39:01,200
basically what the will product
owner, Scrum Master job.

1963
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:04,200
Now we're going to get into something
called artifacts.

1964
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:07,400
These are very important things
that you will work on

1965
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:09,960
when you are basically in an agile
environment.

1966
01:39:09,960 --> 01:39:12,240
What does product backlog means?

1967
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:15,720
What do you guys think
the word product backlog mean?

1968
01:39:15,720 --> 01:39:18,480
What do you
what might you think that maybe

1969
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:27,360
information

1970
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:29,840
the footprint, let's hear back quote,
okay.

1971
01:39:30,680 --> 01:39:31,560
Okay.

1972
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:32,400
Okay.

1973
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:36,560
So a wish list of all design work

1974
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:39,880
on the project,
prioritize by the product quarter.

1975
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:41,280
What does that what do you get

1976
01:39:45,240 --> 01:39:46,080
the press to do?

1977
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:47,240
So someone got it right.

1978
01:39:47,240 --> 01:39:50,040
So all those requirements, right,
for example,

1979
01:39:50,040 --> 01:39:53,960
all those requirements
that needs to be developed and tested.

1980
01:39:53,960 --> 01:39:54,160
Right.

1981
01:39:54,160 --> 01:39:57,680
All the combination of all the product,
all the basically

1982
01:39:58,640 --> 01:40:01,320
what we talk about,
all the things that need to be created,

1983
01:40:01,680 --> 01:40:03,960
you know,
they're coming in a product backlog.

1984
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:04,880
Remember this?

1985
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:06,960
A project might take five years, right?

1986
01:40:07,320 --> 01:40:10,080
It might take five years to do let's do a

1987
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:13,640
there might be so many requirements
that need to be completed and finished.

1988
01:40:13,640 --> 01:40:13,960
Right.

1989
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:17,280
A product backlog is the combination
of all of them.

1990
01:40:17,560 --> 01:40:21,160
From there we take a little of piece of
that we're going to work on

1991
01:40:21,160 --> 01:40:22,760
later on in complete the right.

1992
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:27,080
So it's a combination of all
the basic work that needs to be done.

1993
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:31,600
Now, one thing to remember this, before
we were using the word like all of these

1994
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:35,720
are basically not basically they are
these are all requirements

1995
01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:39,160
that needs to be completely meaning
created and basically tested.

1996
01:40:39,160 --> 01:40:44,320
But now when we come to Agile,
we no longer call it requirements anymore.

1997
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:47,760
Now, remember I told you they did
change the words, same exact thing.

1998
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:50,000
Now we're we don't call them requirement.

1999
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,680
What do you guys think is
called any guess anyone knows

2000
01:40:55,960 --> 01:40:59,120
user stories
and then smaller ones are tasked though

2001
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:05,040
now instead of calling them requirements,
we call them users stories.

2002
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:05,960
Exactly.

2003
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:09,120
And when you break down, for example,
user stories

2004
01:41:09,120 --> 01:41:12,080
into smaller chunks,
then we call them task grade.

2005
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:14,400
So I'll show you some real examples.

2006
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:16,440
You have some idea Exactly.

2007
01:41:16,440 --> 01:41:17,680
These are actual user stories.

2008
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:19,840
So let's just
look at one of these pictures, right?

2009
01:41:19,880 --> 01:41:21,680
Let's just see what it looks like.

2010
01:41:21,680 --> 01:41:26,400
As a user, I want to see tables on page
so I can engage with this content.

2011
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:28,120
So let's say this is a user story.

2012
01:41:28,120 --> 01:41:32,160
When a developer looks at this as a user,
I want to see tables on the page

2013
01:41:32,160 --> 01:41:33,640
so I can engage with context.

2014
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:36,840
They Need to now come
with the functionality and develop this.

2015
01:41:37,160 --> 01:41:40,080
Whatever this users
truly want us to do, right?

2016
01:41:40,280 --> 01:41:42,120
They need to make that into life.

2017
01:41:42,120 --> 01:41:44,400
This is basically what the developers do.

2018
01:41:44,640 --> 01:41:48,640
Remember this in the tech world,
developers and testers,

2019
01:41:48,840 --> 01:41:51,800
we're given
task, let's say for two weeks, right?

2020
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:54,560
Those tasks,
our user stories, requirements

2021
01:41:54,760 --> 01:41:57,960
that needs to be developed
and then they need to be all tested.

2022
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:03,720
So we're calling those user
those requirements now user stories right?

2023
01:42:03,720 --> 01:42:04,760
Let's say, for example,

2024
01:42:04,760 --> 01:42:08,880
a user wants to sign up to Facebook,
a user wants to view the latest updates.

2025
01:42:09,120 --> 01:42:13,400
We are dashboard so they can get a better
understanding of what what is in place

2026
01:42:13,680 --> 01:42:17,080
a user wants to be able to post status
updates on the go.

2027
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:20,280
These are the things that the customer
wants.

2028
01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:22,920
This is what the business
analyst went ahead and wrote down

2029
01:42:23,120 --> 01:42:27,360
that is what the customer wants for
their new system that we're developing.

2030
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:30,400
So developer ABC, go ahead

2031
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:33,400
and develop this
and then we are going to test this.

2032
01:42:33,640 --> 01:42:35,120
Does it make sense?

2033
01:42:35,120 --> 01:42:39,480
Do you understand with remember,
this is all of what the customer want.

2034
01:42:39,640 --> 01:42:43,000
These are the functionalities
now needs to come to life.

2035
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:48,160
So all these you see one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

2036
01:42:48,160 --> 01:42:48,760
Right.

2037
01:42:48,840 --> 01:42:53,200
These are all basically all those users
doing all the requirements

2038
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:56,520
that needs to be created
and might take five years from now.

2039
01:42:56,520 --> 01:43:03,760
Let's see, can we do a
do you get the picture kind of somewhat.

2040
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:06,000
Okay.

2041
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:10,440
Let me let me show you
now how it looks like in real life.

2042
01:43:10,440 --> 01:43:12,400
And remember this,
when you guys go to work,

2043
01:43:13,880 --> 01:43:17,160
you will have some software
that you're going to be working on, right?

2044
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:19,680
You will get access to JIRA, for example.

2045
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,120
You guys will be working on this
in a little bit,

2046
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:24,040
probably in two weeks, three weeks.

2047
01:43:24,040 --> 01:43:27,240
When you guys do manual testing, you
be getting access to this, You see this.

2048
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:30,600
So whatever,
you go to work, for example, right?

2049
01:43:30,600 --> 01:43:33,160
Let's say you check your emails
and everything you do

2050
01:43:33,960 --> 01:43:36,360
and then you have your task, Wait,
what am I going to test?

2051
01:43:36,720 --> 01:43:39,280
Is are they going to send me an email? No,
absolutely not.

2052
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:40,360
That's not how it works.

2053
01:43:40,360 --> 01:43:43,560
They're platforms out there
that are project management, basically

2054
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:48,120
product management, software where,
you know, basically all the tasks are.

2055
01:43:48,280 --> 01:43:49,840
So let me just select a project.

2056
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:55,080
For example,
let me select this one to receive.

2057
01:43:55,080 --> 01:43:56,120
I can show you

2058
01:43:57,240 --> 01:43:58,000
this.

2059
01:43:58,600 --> 01:44:00,560
So for example, this right?

2060
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:04,640
This is now all the work
that needs to be see backlog.

2061
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:07,040
It's basically product backlog.
You see right here.

2062
01:44:07,400 --> 01:44:09,640
This is something called
Sprint number six.

2063
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:15,000
And I'll show you this now, this one is
all the items that you see right here.

2064
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:18,680
These are basically use street
that hasn't been worked on yet.

2065
01:44:18,680 --> 01:44:21,400
They're going to be work in the future,
for example.

2066
01:44:21,400 --> 01:44:21,880
Right.

2067
01:44:22,080 --> 01:44:25,600
Let's say in Sprint number six,
that means active.

2068
01:44:25,680 --> 01:44:28,760
Let's say work is going on two weeks
or three weeks sprint, whatever it is.

2069
01:44:29,080 --> 01:44:33,880
These are all the items that need
to be finished and completed.

2070
01:44:33,880 --> 01:44:36,440
That means they need to be developed
and tested

2071
01:44:36,680 --> 01:44:38,720
within, let's see, the two weeks time.

2072
01:44:38,720 --> 01:44:42,920
And when we're in the tech world,
this is how we basically see them right

2073
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:45,560
by the time of the deadline. Right.

2074
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:49,880
All this you see right here
to do in progress in and done.

2075
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:55,720
They all need to be in the done section
they must This is a way

2076
01:44:55,720 --> 01:45:00,240
for us to basically or the team
to see the progress and manage it.

2077
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:03,360
These are all the things that need to be,
for example

2078
01:45:03,720 --> 01:45:05,400
you see it
you're seeing across crossing them.

2079
01:45:05,400 --> 01:45:06,720
They're completely done.

2080
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:09,840
For example, to do
that means a developer hasn't even started

2081
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:11,400
working on this industry.

2082
01:45:11,400 --> 01:45:15,280
They're going to be working on it in the
they're going to make all this

2083
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:18,360
whatever this description is,
they're going to make it into life.

2084
01:45:18,640 --> 01:45:20,920
These are all your task lists. Absolutely.

2085
01:45:21,120 --> 01:45:22,720
That's the best way to look at it.

2086
01:45:22,720 --> 01:45:27,360
And when we took a look at all
the accumulation of all the user stories

2087
01:45:27,680 --> 01:45:32,280
that hasn't been worked
on, there are in the product backlog,

2088
01:45:32,280 --> 01:45:35,920
does it make sense
now that you see visually what you see?

2089
01:45:36,120 --> 01:45:39,440
For example, for example, let's say
tomorrow you're working on this project.

2090
01:45:40,040 --> 01:45:41,560
Let me deselect some.

2091
01:45:41,560 --> 01:45:44,080
Let's let's see,
your name is Vladislav, right?

2092
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:49,680
You will most likely get five, six,
seven or six users be assigned to you.

2093
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,200
So let's say
when you log into your software,

2094
01:45:52,200 --> 01:45:55,800
that means in two weeks you need to test
all of these user stories.

2095
01:45:56,160 --> 01:45:59,840
The developer has to create them,
they will develop it,

2096
01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:03,360
and then you will test it
and you later on will Basically,

2097
01:46:03,560 --> 01:46:05,920
when you're working on it,
whatever you're doing, you move it.

2098
01:46:06,120 --> 01:46:07,240
No, it's not scary.

2099
01:46:07,240 --> 01:46:08,640
You just you're seeing a lot of wording

2100
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:10,680
and everything that you don't understand
at this point.

2101
01:46:10,680 --> 01:46:12,680
A lot of different technical things.

2102
01:46:12,680 --> 01:46:13,800
But it's very easy.

2103
01:46:13,800 --> 01:46:17,600
It's very easy, but you get the picture
right when you go to work.

2104
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:21,320
For example, your task will be,
let's say four or five of them right here.

2105
01:46:21,320 --> 01:46:23,280
Let's say in this project, I'll go here

2106
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:25,920
and see.

2107
01:46:26,240 --> 01:46:28,920
This is in a current sprint, for example,
or let's say, and

2108
01:46:28,920 --> 01:46:33,360
I just kind of build and see Sprint to me
when Sprint number three, for example.

2109
01:46:33,360 --> 01:46:33,560
Right?

2110
01:46:33,560 --> 01:46:37,080
That means Sprint number three has
a lot of things that are being developed.

2111
01:46:37,360 --> 01:46:41,520
Remember this, this is just
for a sample example of purpose right now.

2112
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:45,880
Right in the past
there was a sprint number two.

2113
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:47,840
And remember, it's not one person.

2114
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:50,760
This is all of the work combined.

2115
01:46:50,840 --> 01:46:53,960
You see Sprint number two,
that was done in the past.

2116
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:55,760
You see they're done.

2117
01:46:55,760 --> 01:46:58,440
Sprint number four, backlog, all of this.

2118
01:46:58,680 --> 01:47:00,120
Now, this is good.

2119
01:47:00,120 --> 01:47:00,920
This is a good side.

2120
01:47:00,920 --> 01:47:03,000
I mean, to scale,
let me open up a different project

2121
01:47:03,400 --> 01:47:04,880
because you guys
are going to get scared, not

2122
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:08,760
me to look at something else.

2123
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:11,360
These are all projects
that are students then.

2124
01:47:11,360 --> 01:47:13,400
So you'll be doing all of this too.

2125
01:47:13,400 --> 01:47:15,840
So you'll be working with all of this.

2126
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:18,480
Let me find simple statements.

2127
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:19,640
Fine. Look.

2128
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:21,800
Okay, perfect.

2129
01:47:21,800 --> 01:47:23,480
So backlog, right.

2130
01:47:23,480 --> 01:47:28,120
So who's the person who can move from,
let's say, backlog and say,

2131
01:47:28,120 --> 01:47:30,840
hey, guys, in this sprint,
let's add some of these things,

2132
01:47:32,440 --> 01:47:34,560
let's work on this thing.

2133
01:47:34,720 --> 01:47:36,320
Only product owner, right?

2134
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:41,880
So that means only product owner has
the access to move something confirmed.

2135
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:45,840
You see right here,
I just moved this and I moved it to.

2136
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:48,960
Let's say for example, see it will be
moved back backlog to blah blah, blah.

2137
01:47:49,240 --> 01:47:50,360
That means they're the one

2138
01:47:50,360 --> 01:47:54,240
who can move only product owner,
no Scrum master, nobody.

2139
01:47:54,480 --> 01:47:58,560
They have the right what needs to be
worked on, what needs to be not worked on.

2140
01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:02,080
So let's say this user story
is not being completed a product.

2141
01:48:02,120 --> 01:48:06,240
Whatever the situation with this, this too
complicated claim isn't a way a product

2142
01:48:06,240 --> 01:48:08,000
owner has the right

2143
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:11,880
to take it out from there
and put it in the backlog and be like,

2144
01:48:11,880 --> 01:48:14,960
Hey, we'll work on this in two weeks
or in three weeks.

2145
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:16,280
We'll on it later on.

2146
01:48:16,280 --> 01:48:19,800
So this is
how tasks are basically broken down

2147
01:48:19,920 --> 01:48:24,200
when we go into, let's see, work
rate, for example, as an army user

2148
01:48:24,200 --> 01:48:27,560
should be able to add different membership
and requalification, blah, blah, blah.

2149
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:30,240
So this is what the developer will see.

2150
01:48:30,240 --> 01:48:34,200
Okay, I need to come up and figure out
a way how I can add membership

2151
01:48:34,200 --> 01:48:34,920
and blah blah.

2152
01:48:34,920 --> 01:48:35,960
So they will go ahead.

2153
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:39,720
For example, develop all of this,
whatever this you just really want.

2154
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:43,960
Because remember this this user story
is directly from the client.

2155
01:48:43,960 --> 01:48:46,320
This this was given to the business
analyst,

2156
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:48,840
the business and created this user story.

2157
01:48:49,080 --> 01:48:51,120
You guys don't create any of this, right?

2158
01:48:51,480 --> 01:48:54,240
The business owners or product owner
created of this.

2159
01:48:54,480 --> 01:48:59,040
Then later on, the developer
will be working in creating this later on.

2160
01:48:59,040 --> 01:49:03,760
The same thing that was developed
might be assigned to you as a tester,

2161
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:08,680
say let's say auger
and you will have to test this later on.

2162
01:49:08,920 --> 01:49:12,120
How you keep track of the statuses is you
look at it

2163
01:49:12,120 --> 01:49:15,120
for example, here
you see into doing progress done.

2164
01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:18,360
You see it in
indifferent fashion when, let's say

2165
01:49:18,360 --> 01:49:21,680
for example, a developer is going to start
working on this use story.

2166
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:24,000
He will say in progress Right,
I'm going to start work.

2167
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:27,960
And that means me as a tester
because this user is assigned to me

2168
01:49:27,960 --> 01:49:28,800
as well to also,

2169
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:32,760
okay, when it comes over here, then
I can go ahead and start testing right?

2170
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:36,640
So this is a software
basically project management tool

2171
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:39,480
that visually controls
what you will be doing.

2172
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:42,720
All of this now this is all agile,

2173
01:49:42,720 --> 01:49:45,600
you see, you see Sprint,
you see the different words in here.

2174
01:49:45,880 --> 01:49:49,320
You visually see exactly
what needs to be worked on

2175
01:49:49,320 --> 01:49:51,840
and what's the status of
it doesn't make sense.

2176
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:57,360
Now, visually that you see
what's going on.

2177
01:49:57,360 --> 01:49:58,480
Not too difficult, right?

2178
01:49:58,480 --> 01:50:01,560
I would say that means it's basically
very basic

2179
01:50:01,560 --> 01:50:04,760
stuff, even though at the beginning
my looks a little complicated.

2180
01:50:04,760 --> 01:50:07,640
But if you look at it's
not really that difficult.

2181
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:13,080
So product backlog backlog is the entirety
of all the things

2182
01:50:13,080 --> 01:50:16,160
that need to be completed
that need to be worked on.

2183
01:50:16,440 --> 01:50:19,160
And in how long do we do by the end?

2184
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:22,720
What's what do we do with the timeline
that we we work on this thing?

2185
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:24,520
What is that called?

2186
01:50:24,520 --> 01:50:25,480
Sprints.

2187
01:50:25,480 --> 01:50:29,600
Sprints is basically we do
sprints can be one week, five weeks,

2188
01:50:29,600 --> 01:50:35,000
six weeks, eight weeks, correct.

2189
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:35,760
So let's say yes.

2190
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:38,520
No, only 1 to 4 weeks. No, eight weeks.

2191
01:50:38,720 --> 01:50:39,960
1 to 4 weeks. Right.

2192
01:50:39,960 --> 01:50:41,120
Only 1 to 4 weeks.

2193
01:50:41,120 --> 01:50:43,800
Timeline is fixed. Remember that.

2194
01:50:43,800 --> 01:50:46,200
It doesn't mean
that it's going to be one week, one week

2195
01:50:46,200 --> 01:50:47,760
next week is going to it's not

2196
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:50,680
whatever the company choose
either is one week, two weeks, three weeks

2197
01:50:50,680 --> 01:50:51,880
or four weeks.

2198
01:50:51,880 --> 01:50:55,120
All companies,
JIRA, not all companies use it.

2199
01:50:56,320 --> 01:50:58,080
JIRA is very popular.

2200
01:50:58,080 --> 01:51:01,920
A lot of company uses it, but a lot of
similar softwares are out there as well.

2201
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:04,520
Do A lot of similar ones out there.

2202
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:07,840
Now there is a microsoft
DevOps is out there.

2203
01:51:08,080 --> 01:51:10,080
I forgot a tool out there, Azure DevOps.

2204
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:14,640
There's a lot of them out there, but
they all are very similar rally rationale.

2205
01:51:15,320 --> 01:51:17,520
Once you learn JIRA, for example.

2206
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:18,600
Literally guys,

2207
01:51:18,600 --> 01:51:22,040
when I first played with JIRA, it took me
one hour to figure out everything.

2208
01:51:22,160 --> 01:51:23,480
It is so simple.

2209
01:51:23,480 --> 01:51:24,680
Very simple, right?

2210
01:51:24,680 --> 01:51:26,800
So a lot of the tools are very similar.

2211
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:29,360
They just made by different companies
and everything.

2212
01:51:30,480 --> 01:51:33,440
Yeah, it's like allocation
when maybe you've used Monday

2213
01:51:33,440 --> 01:51:34,880
dot com or something like that.

2214
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:36,360
Very similar time. Great.

2215
01:51:36,360 --> 01:51:40,560
Using the task
and I think that's basically what it is.

2216
01:51:41,120 --> 01:51:44,760
Duran Duran software is different
now at least in of the company

2217
01:51:44,760 --> 01:51:47,840
they have different softwares
JIRA has different version.

2218
01:51:48,080 --> 01:51:52,400
There's one for documentation, one is for
software development and such as well to

2219
01:51:57,240 --> 01:52:01,040
So let's
look at oops, did I go too far ahead?

2220
01:52:01,320 --> 01:52:04,960
So we understand
what a product backlog is right now.

2221
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:07,720
What do you think a Sprint backlog is?

2222
01:52:07,720 --> 01:52:15,000
What do you think that means?

2223
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:16,080
There are two different things.

2224
01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:25,560
There's one called product backlog
and sprint room.

2225
01:52:25,560 --> 01:52:29,240
Exactly what needs to be done
exactly in that sprint.

2226
01:52:29,240 --> 01:52:32,840
Remember, product is the entirety
that needs to be done right.

2227
01:52:33,240 --> 01:52:37,160
But we cannot work on the entire
let's say, for example,

2228
01:52:37,280 --> 01:52:41,080
whatever everything is,
we can only do some parts of it, right?

2229
01:52:41,280 --> 01:52:43,800
So let's say there are six items
we might be able to work

2230
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:46,840
only on two of them
in, let's say, a matter of two weeks.

2231
01:52:46,840 --> 01:52:47,320
Right?

2232
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:52,800
So items pick from the wish list, product
backlog by the development team, execute.

2233
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:54,880
Do this better, prioritize
by the development team.

2234
01:52:54,880 --> 01:52:55,800
Each user

2235
01:52:55,800 --> 01:52:58,800
still will be assigned points now,
which I'll explain a little bit later.

2236
01:52:59,080 --> 01:53:04,440
But basically in sprint backlog is you are
working on exactly what that sprint is.

2237
01:53:04,440 --> 01:53:07,000
For example, we pick the items from here.

2238
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:11,160
Let's say this is the product backlog
right now, This is the sprint backlog.

2239
01:53:11,160 --> 01:53:14,960
I know for a fact I don't care about this
and I'll be working on this.

2240
01:53:15,240 --> 01:53:18,000
These are the items
that you working in that sprint.

2241
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:22,800
So that means all of this tasks, let's say
our company has a two week sprint.

2242
01:53:23,160 --> 01:53:26,160
This all needs to be completed
within two weeks.

2243
01:53:26,440 --> 01:53:31,600
That means by the end of the two weeks,
let's say deadline is Friday, 5:00.

2244
01:53:32,080 --> 01:53:35,640
Everything must be here in the done
section.

2245
01:53:35,920 --> 01:53:38,760
Everything must be here
If something is, let's say,

2246
01:53:39,160 --> 01:53:41,560
missing, for example,
let's say I'm going to do this.

2247
01:53:42,080 --> 01:53:45,360
Let's see, let's see,
Let's say we did all the thing.

2248
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:46,680
Developers worked on everything.

2249
01:53:46,680 --> 01:53:48,720
Everything got in a done section.

2250
01:53:48,720 --> 01:53:51,360
This item was not,
let's say it was in progress, but

2251
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:54,720
5:00 hit deadline
and we're not able to finish this.

2252
01:53:55,080 --> 01:53:59,160
Then what will happen, guys,
when we look at this, this item,

2253
01:53:59,160 --> 01:54:03,480
whichever that one was, they'll push it
back to the pop product backlog.

2254
01:54:03,800 --> 01:54:08,520
And later on,
the product owner will decide, okay, one,

2255
01:54:08,520 --> 01:54:12,480
we can work on this in the future,
on which spring we can work on.

2256
01:54:12,720 --> 01:54:14,400
And remember this.

2257
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:17,240
The other thing,
whenever you are showcasing,

2258
01:54:17,640 --> 01:54:20,200
let's see whatever you
develop right, For example,

2259
01:54:21,840 --> 01:54:22,440
all the

2260
01:54:22,440 --> 01:54:25,120
features that you develop
and use your keys into the client,

2261
01:54:25,480 --> 01:54:29,920
all the feedback, everything that's coming
along, where do you think it goes?

2262
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:32,160
Does anyone have any idea

2263
01:54:38,080 --> 01:54:43,680
that you know,
where does all the feedback comes back?

2264
01:54:44,080 --> 01:54:46,120
It goes back to the product backlog.

2265
01:54:46,160 --> 01:54:48,120
It will be added all over here.

2266
01:54:48,120 --> 01:54:49,520
It will be added all over here.

2267
01:54:49,520 --> 01:54:52,560
And yes,
the people will decide whether it goes

2268
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:56,040
in the next spring, the following spring,
whenever whatever comes.

2269
01:54:56,040 --> 01:54:56,280
Right.

2270
01:54:56,280 --> 01:54:59,480
Let's say the feedback with the changes
the client wants after

2271
01:54:59,480 --> 01:55:03,280
we did a presentation to them, right,
they'll come back to the product backlog.

2272
01:55:03,480 --> 01:55:04,080
It goes.

2273
01:55:04,080 --> 01:55:06,720
Remember,
this product backlog can be massive.

2274
01:55:06,720 --> 01:55:08,480
Let me just show you another one.

2275
01:55:08,480 --> 01:55:10,720
Let's say, for example,
let's not look at this one, but

2276
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:13,320
look at this product
backlog versus the other product.

2277
01:55:13,320 --> 01:55:16,640
But this is just for example,
you see there's a lot of items here.

2278
01:55:16,840 --> 01:55:20,040
So product backlog keeps on getting bigger

2279
01:55:20,040 --> 01:55:22,920
and bigger because all the changes
and things like that

2280
01:55:23,160 --> 01:55:27,960
that are being requested by clients
goes back to that product backlog.

2281
01:55:27,960 --> 01:55:32,480
Sprint backlog is exactly what
we'll be working in that two week sprint.

2282
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:36,600
Basically nothing because we don't care
about anything as these six items.

2283
01:55:36,600 --> 01:55:37,520
We're basically pick

2284
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:41,760
from the product backlog into spring back
and we're going to be working on that.

2285
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:45,880
That's that's basically
exactly the same thing if you look at it.

2286
01:55:46,080 --> 01:55:48,280
It's just the items
that need to be worked on.

2287
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:50,640
We call that a sprint backlog.

2288
01:55:50,640 --> 01:55:51,720
Does it make sense?

2289
01:55:51,720 --> 01:55:59,760
Got is it crystal clear
any doubts, any confusion?

2290
01:55:59,760 --> 01:56:01,560
Okay, perfect. Perfect.

2291
01:56:02,600 --> 01:56:05,320
In some companies,
guys, maybe you've seen some shows

2292
01:56:05,320 --> 01:56:09,840
and I think some companies,
what they do is they actually do it

2293
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:12,360
on whiteboards as well
do now you can do it.

2294
01:56:12,360 --> 01:56:16,480
The digital version, let's say, for
example, through software, through JIRA,

2295
01:56:16,480 --> 01:56:20,560
what a lot of companies, what they also do
is just for visually may be all right.

2296
01:56:20,560 --> 01:56:23,000
Tasks like this stories
you see that these are used

2297
01:56:23,640 --> 01:56:26,200
to do in progress in testing spring.

2298
01:56:26,200 --> 01:56:26,760
Right.

2299
01:56:26,760 --> 01:56:29,360
Just to move it around
just for visual purpose.

2300
01:56:29,360 --> 01:56:31,360
Some people would do,
some companies will do it.

2301
01:56:31,600 --> 01:56:33,480
Maybe you've seen this.

2302
01:56:33,480 --> 01:56:35,160
Have you ever seen this show?

2303
01:56:35,160 --> 01:56:43,040
Any of you have seen Silicon
Valley used to be on HBO.

2304
01:56:43,040 --> 01:56:45,560
You have
then you definitely have seen this.

2305
01:56:45,720 --> 01:56:48,360
You've seen those developers
go and move the tasks, right?

2306
01:56:48,560 --> 01:56:50,520
They do it on sticky notes, right?

2307
01:56:50,520 --> 01:56:54,120
So is another visual way of seeing
what the progress is.

2308
01:56:54,120 --> 01:56:57,480
Remember,
is just having a visual representation

2309
01:56:57,480 --> 01:56:59,440
of what the progress is right now.

2310
01:56:59,440 --> 01:57:01,520
What a Scrum Master would. Right.

2311
01:57:01,520 --> 01:57:03,320
Let's say, for example. Right.

2312
01:57:03,320 --> 01:57:07,040
It's the end of the week and there's
items in here like less in progress

2313
01:57:07,080 --> 01:57:07,920
going to do.

2314
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:10,200
The Scrum Master is going to go back
to the developer.

2315
01:57:10,200 --> 01:57:14,360
Hey, by way, buddy,
DEADLINE is on the on Friday of 5 p.m..

2316
01:57:14,520 --> 01:57:16,680
Why are you being behind?
Do you need some help?

2317
01:57:16,920 --> 01:57:18,000
Are you behind?

2318
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:18,840
This is what they do.

2319
01:57:18,840 --> 01:57:20,800
They look at the progress of it.

2320
01:57:20,800 --> 01:57:22,720
What's going on? Are we on time?

2321
01:57:22,720 --> 01:57:24,720
Are we on track and things like that?

2322
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:28,440
This is what a Scrum
master on a day to day is looking at.

2323
01:57:28,440 --> 01:57:31,800
And of course, at the same time
running those meetings, basically.

2324
01:57:32,240 --> 01:57:35,960
Now there's another visual way
of looking at backlog in progress

2325
01:57:35,960 --> 01:57:37,320
committed in progress done.

2326
01:57:37,320 --> 01:57:40,440
There's another example
of it, different softwares out there,

2327
01:57:40,440 --> 01:57:44,240
but they all are basically
doing the same thing to short attraction

2328
01:57:44,240 --> 01:57:45,240
of what's going on.

2329
01:57:45,240 --> 01:57:47,640
Are you on on the right path?

2330
01:57:47,640 --> 01:57:51,360
Basically, are we on the right
path of completing on time?

2331
01:57:51,800 --> 01:57:54,960
Everything you see right
here needs to be by the end of the week,

2332
01:57:55,320 --> 01:57:57,360
needs to be here in the done section.

2333
01:57:57,360 --> 01:57:59,080
If they're not in the done section,

2334
01:57:59,080 --> 01:58:02,400
they go back to the backlog
they'll be worked on in the future.

2335
01:58:02,840 --> 01:58:03,440
Make sense?

2336
01:58:03,440 --> 01:58:07,840
Clear, guys.

2337
01:58:07,840 --> 01:58:09,600
Easy, easy, easy.

2338
01:58:09,600 --> 01:58:11,720
Yeah, they just look complicated,
but it's easier.

2339
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:15,840
Then the other thing that we saw over
here, let's see, what was it then?

2340
01:58:15,840 --> 01:58:18,160
There was something called a burn down
chart.

2341
01:58:18,160 --> 01:58:20,760
Now, this is not really for you.

2342
01:58:21,400 --> 01:58:23,040
This is more for management.

2343
01:58:23,040 --> 01:58:23,880
But let's leave it.

2344
01:58:23,880 --> 01:58:25,920
Let's see what up?
Burn down. Chart this. Right.

2345
01:58:27,080 --> 01:58:29,080
So a burn down chart.

2346
01:58:29,080 --> 01:58:30,800
This is one of the reports.

2347
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:33,320
Reports that basically is an agile.

2348
01:58:33,320 --> 01:58:33,760
Let me see.

2349
01:58:33,760 --> 01:58:37,720
I can look in here reports we see burn
not just been reports

2350
01:58:37,720 --> 01:58:43,200
and I mean this is charts to determine
the progress of the trail on the spring.

2351
01:58:43,480 --> 01:58:45,760
The team should answer
following question every day.

2352
01:58:45,800 --> 01:58:48,800
How much work remains
has been in this team on the spin

2353
01:58:49,080 --> 01:58:51,960
on is the team on track
to finish all the work in space?

2354
01:58:51,960 --> 01:58:53,280
Should we add work rate?

2355
01:58:53,280 --> 01:58:57,160
So this burn down charge
that we see usually starts from the top

2356
01:58:57,160 --> 01:58:58,840
end is to basically any.

2357
01:58:58,840 --> 01:59:02,040
It is not that important,
but just to understand it

2358
01:59:02,280 --> 01:59:07,200
basically a burn down chart are just
and there are some other reports here but

2359
01:59:07,320 --> 01:59:11,040
burn is probably one of the most important
one basically tracks to progress.

2360
01:59:11,040 --> 01:59:14,080
Now this is more not for you,
it's more for product

2361
01:59:14,080 --> 01:59:17,520
owners can measure just to keep track of,
Hey, what's going on?

2362
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:18,480
Are we on track?

2363
01:59:18,480 --> 01:59:20,160
Like this is not correct,

2364
01:59:20,160 --> 01:59:23,520
but usually starts from the top
and it basically changes.

2365
01:59:23,520 --> 01:59:24,000
Let me see.

2366
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:27,680
I can find another one that's a little bit
more better constructive. See

2367
01:59:29,600 --> 01:59:31,080
figure eight to

2368
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:48,360
choose.

2369
01:59:48,360 --> 01:59:49,200
You don't have either.

2370
01:59:49,200 --> 01:59:51,240
But anyway, let me just go back to this.

2371
01:59:51,720 --> 01:59:52,400
Okay.

2372
01:59:52,440 --> 01:59:55,800
Anyway, not so important,
but you see how this this chart looks like

2373
01:59:55,800 --> 01:59:57,520
or let me go back over here.

2374
01:59:57,520 --> 02:00:01,760
Well, typically, whenever let's say
you're falling behind when you're moving

2375
02:00:01,760 --> 02:00:06,400
all these let's say, for example
to do it in progress, all this thing,

2376
02:00:06,760 --> 02:00:11,680
what that chart is basically it's
a changing life chart that changes, right?

2377
02:00:11,880 --> 02:00:16,080
It goes up and down and everything
you want basically from the top to down.

2378
02:00:16,080 --> 02:00:17,280
You want it to come down.

2379
02:00:17,280 --> 02:00:21,720
It basically shows the Scrum master
and product owner what's going on.

2380
02:00:21,720 --> 02:00:24,120
If it's this chart is going like this,
it goes up.

2381
02:00:24,160 --> 02:00:25,720
That means some issues came on.

2382
02:00:25,720 --> 02:00:26,720
We need to go up.

2383
02:00:26,720 --> 02:00:29,520
It's just a visual representation
of the progress.

2384
02:00:29,720 --> 02:00:32,320
What is being done
and is being calculated in a chart.

2385
02:00:32,640 --> 02:00:34,760
Is it important for you guys?

2386
02:00:34,760 --> 02:00:37,520
Not so much if you really ask me, but

2387
02:00:37,520 --> 02:00:41,400
just know that an engineer might ask you
what is a burned down chart?

2388
02:00:41,400 --> 02:00:45,840
You just tell them, Hey, it's a chart
determines the progress of this spring,

2389
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:49,240
what's being done, what not done,
and how much work is remaining.

2390
02:00:49,680 --> 02:00:51,960
That's all it is. Nothing fancy.

2391
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,760
Don't know why they call it spring
burn down chart.

2392
02:00:55,120 --> 02:00:56,240
They make it complicated.

2393
02:00:56,240 --> 02:00:58,120
But this is what exactly it is, though.

2394
02:00:58,120 --> 02:00:59,960
And there are more charts out there too.

2395
02:00:59,960 --> 02:01:04,000
They're more reporting out
there as well to let me see

2396
02:01:10,760 --> 02:01:12,320
all the reports

2397
02:01:13,560 --> 02:01:15,640
see their different control epic.

2398
02:01:15,640 --> 02:01:19,720
I generally, if you ask me,
I probably know only two of them in here

2399
02:01:19,800 --> 02:01:23,360
and I don't care about it
because I am not a Scrum master

2400
02:01:23,640 --> 02:01:25,680
or a product owner,
so I wouldn't really care.

2401
02:01:25,680 --> 02:01:29,600
But this is just a visual representation
for management

2402
02:01:29,600 --> 02:01:32,120
basically to see what the progress is

2403
02:01:32,320 --> 02:01:34,720
and they're calculated
by looking at this spring burn.

2404
02:01:35,040 --> 02:01:37,680
So Scrum master and product owner
most like is look at it,

2405
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:39,520
Are you going to care much about it?

2406
02:01:39,520 --> 02:01:42,840
Not so much,
but is good to know what it is now.

2407
02:01:42,840 --> 02:01:45,440
Do we understand what a burn down
chart is?

2408
02:01:45,680 --> 02:01:47,040
Does it make sense?

2409
02:01:47,040 --> 02:01:51,240
It's just calculating the work, remaining
very straightforward, very simple,

2410
02:01:51,560 --> 02:01:54,120
Not so much important
for testers and developers,

2411
02:01:54,360 --> 02:01:58,320
but important for Scrum, Mass and product
owner just to know what's out there.

2412
02:01:58,320 --> 02:02:03,040
Remember, if you look at JIRA backlog,
you'll have where the items are,

2413
02:02:03,040 --> 02:02:06,320
let's say the sprint status
visually in a way

2414
02:02:06,720 --> 02:02:09,880
see reports and then there's releases,
which I'll explain a bit later.

2415
02:02:10,160 --> 02:02:13,360
Not too many features
I hear, and it's very, very easy.

2416
02:02:13,640 --> 02:02:17,360
All these softwares
are very, very similar.

2417
02:02:19,080 --> 02:02:21,720
Ensure assures
the progress of the project, right?

2418
02:02:21,720 --> 02:02:22,720
Absolutely.

2419
02:02:22,720 --> 02:02:24,760
Is showing the progress of the sprint.

2420
02:02:24,760 --> 02:02:28,120
Usually what's going on there,
they try to break it down springs.

2421
02:02:28,120 --> 02:02:32,080
So you know, if you're basically
on the right track or not and keep in mind

2422
02:02:32,080 --> 02:02:36,160
that's the Scrum master is looking at
if someone is falling behind,

2423
02:02:36,400 --> 02:02:39,080
can I get them some help,
do whatever I can for them.

2424
02:02:39,240 --> 02:02:41,480
So we finish on time. Basically.

2425
02:02:41,480 --> 02:02:43,560
That's what basically
is happening over here.

2426
02:02:43,560 --> 02:02:46,200
So now we covered let's see

2427
02:02:47,240 --> 02:02:49,080
rolls and artifact.

2428
02:02:49,080 --> 02:02:52,600
Does it make sense
so far in the rolls artifact?

2429
02:02:52,640 --> 02:02:53,400
All of them.

2430
02:02:53,400 --> 02:02:55,720
Product backlog, spring burn down chart.

2431
02:02:56,480 --> 02:03:00,120
Is this by any chance let me ask you this
and give me an honest opinion.

2432
02:03:00,600 --> 02:03:01,720
Is this complicated

2433
02:03:03,720 --> 02:03:05,040
yes or no?

2434
02:03:05,920 --> 02:03:06,920
Not really. Right.

2435
02:03:06,920 --> 02:03:09,000
It's not really complicated.

2436
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:13,040
And I guarantee you that majority
what I'm teaching right here,

2437
02:03:14,040 --> 02:03:16,640
if you want to become a Scrum master
and get a certification,

2438
02:03:16,640 --> 02:03:21,680
they teach you this in two days, charge
you anywhere from 900 to 1200 dollars.

2439
02:03:21,680 --> 02:03:23,480
And this is pretty simple stuff, right?

2440
02:03:23,480 --> 02:03:24,520
And that's how much they charge.

2441
02:03:24,520 --> 02:03:26,000
They go more,
maybe a little bit more in depth.

2442
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:26,760
Good, but simple.

2443
02:03:26,760 --> 02:03:29,680
Overall, this one is it's
just a lot of terminology,

2444
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:36,480
different terms,
basically but it's very simple.

2445
02:03:36,480 --> 02:03:40,480
Catalina, for spring backlog,
what spring burned out is just a chart

2446
02:03:40,480 --> 02:03:42,960
progress cheating spring
backlog is remember

2447
02:03:43,280 --> 02:03:45,240
of what items you were working strictly

2448
02:03:45,240 --> 02:03:49,000
that spring backlog is that cumulation
of everything spring back.

2449
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:50,160
Let me just a few things

2450
02:03:50,160 --> 02:03:53,600
you take from the product backlog
and you can develop that.

2451
02:03:53,880 --> 02:03:56,040
So very simple, very easy.

2452
02:03:56,240 --> 02:04:03,360
If you look at just a little bit
too much terminology,

2453
02:04:03,360 --> 02:04:05,520
what is the similar term for artifacts?

2454
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:11,600
I'll put it this way, important items,
That's the best way to look at it.

2455
02:04:11,600 --> 02:04:13,840
It is a folder that holds
all the pending does.

2456
02:04:14,240 --> 02:04:16,320
That's the way to look at it as well
too. Sure.

2457
02:04:16,560 --> 02:04:20,760
It's basically yeah, that's a folder
that holds whatever needs to be completed.

2458
02:04:20,760 --> 02:04:22,120
Absolutely Abdoul.

2459
02:04:22,120 --> 02:04:24,000
That's a good way of looking at whatever.

2460
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:25,680
Make it easy and simple for you.

2461
02:04:25,680 --> 02:04:27,480
Works fine for me.

2462
02:04:27,480 --> 02:04:28,080
Okay.

2463
02:04:28,080 --> 02:04:31,920
Now what we're going to going to
the very last part is ceremonies.

2464
02:04:32,160 --> 02:04:34,320
And remember
I said it's basically meetings.

2465
02:04:34,320 --> 02:04:36,600
That's the fancy way to look at it.

2466
02:04:36,600 --> 02:04:40,120
The ceremonies are just meetings
now in in Agile.

2467
02:04:40,120 --> 02:04:42,000
There are a lot of meetings there, right?

2468
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,280
A lot of meetings that we're going to go
over.

2469
02:04:44,280 --> 02:04:46,240
Spring grooming, spring planning,

2470
02:04:46,240 --> 02:04:49,840
Spring review,
Sprint retrospective, daily scrum meeting.

2471
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:52,080
Okay, let's break down
what each meeting is

2472
02:04:52,400 --> 02:04:55,320
and remember, you will be participating
in these meetings.

2473
02:04:55,320 --> 02:04:57,320
So it's important
that you know what they are.

2474
02:04:57,320 --> 02:04:58,400
Let's see.

2475
02:04:58,440 --> 02:04:58,800
Okay.

2476
02:04:58,800 --> 02:05:01,200
Spring Planning, backlog,
grooming or spring grooming?

2477
02:05:01,200 --> 02:05:03,480
Same thing. Daily stand up spring demo.

2478
02:05:04,440 --> 02:05:07,800
Now, later on, I think it's going to make
sense to you when we go to the picture.

2479
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,200
Let's start off with the first one.

2480
02:05:10,200 --> 02:05:11,760
Let's start from the bottom. I don't know.

2481
02:05:11,760 --> 02:05:15,120
They're not in the best order,
but let's start off with the daily up.

2482
02:05:15,120 --> 02:05:18,680
Okay? Which is which one?

2483
02:05:18,680 --> 02:05:23,160
It starts from the daily scrum meeting,
which is also called a daily standup.

2484
02:05:23,400 --> 02:05:25,920
So in Agile scrum,

2485
02:05:27,400 --> 02:05:29,640
the very first thing during the morning,
guys,

2486
02:05:29,880 --> 02:05:34,720
you always have a meeting, always
and usually 15 minutes

2487
02:05:34,720 --> 02:05:38,920
long is a meeting that happens
in that 50 minute long meeting.

2488
02:05:38,920 --> 02:05:39,360
Okay.

2489
02:05:39,360 --> 02:05:42,240
Scrum Master is basically,
like I said, is the coordinator.

2490
02:05:42,640 --> 02:05:47,000
They're the one who basically
is going to ask each developer investors

2491
02:05:47,760 --> 02:05:51,200
what you did yesterday,
what you plan on doing today.

2492
02:05:51,480 --> 02:05:54,520
And also,
are there any impediments, any blockers?

2493
02:05:54,920 --> 02:05:56,760
Update of a Yes, absolutely.

2494
02:05:56,760 --> 02:06:01,240
Update And usually the way you're looking
at the picture is typically like this.

2495
02:06:01,240 --> 02:06:03,240
Imagine this guy's a scrum master.

2496
02:06:03,240 --> 02:06:05,280
Each person, one by one goes.

2497
02:06:05,280 --> 02:06:08,280
Yesterday
I worked on user story, blah, blah, blah.

2498
02:06:08,360 --> 02:06:09,720
I got finished with it.

2499
02:06:09,720 --> 02:06:11,880
Today I'm going to be working on this one.

2500
02:06:11,880 --> 02:06:13,840
Whatever I'm working, I use a story.

2501
02:06:13,840 --> 02:06:14,880
One, two, three.

2502
02:06:14,880 --> 02:06:17,520
And I have no impediments.
Meaning no blockers.

2503
02:06:17,520 --> 02:06:19,640
I don't have any issues right now.

2504
02:06:19,640 --> 02:06:23,400
The reason of this meeting
is not the meeting.

2505
02:06:23,400 --> 02:06:27,760
Asset status is not just to spy
on your micromanagement.

2506
02:06:27,760 --> 02:06:32,560
No, the whole point of this meeting is to
see if there are any impediments,

2507
02:06:32,560 --> 02:06:33,960
any problems. Right.

2508
02:06:33,960 --> 02:06:39,000
So let's say, for example, let's say
our deadline is Friday and today's Friday

2509
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:43,360
and I'm working on a user story,
for example, let's say as a test, right?

2510
02:06:43,880 --> 02:06:47,760
But it hasn't been developed
that the developer is taking too long.

2511
02:06:48,160 --> 02:06:51,480
I remember this first,
something has to be created

2512
02:06:51,680 --> 02:06:53,360
only then you can test you, right?

2513
02:06:53,360 --> 02:06:56,720
So if the developer does not code
on, let's say, on a future,

2514
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,040
how are you going to test it? Right.
You can't.

2515
02:06:59,040 --> 02:07:02,240
So let's see in this meeting
you can bring up this right.

2516
02:07:02,480 --> 02:07:06,920
You can say yesterday as a test array,
I worked on user story three, five, six.

2517
02:07:06,920 --> 02:07:08,000
Today I'm going to be working.

2518
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:11,520
I have remaining 1 to 3 user story,
which I need to test.

2519
02:07:11,840 --> 02:07:13,400
However, my impediment is

2520
02:07:13,400 --> 02:07:17,320
this is the last day today and developer
or whoever the person is.

2521
02:07:17,520 --> 02:07:19,320
Yeah, I'm waiting on you, buddy.

2522
02:07:19,320 --> 02:07:20,760
You're taking too long.

2523
02:07:20,760 --> 02:07:21,840
This is the point of it.

2524
02:07:21,840 --> 02:07:25,400
If any problems comes,
you want to discuss this in the meeting

2525
02:07:25,400 --> 02:07:28,800
because you have the developers,
the developers there, the team is there.

2526
02:07:29,120 --> 02:07:31,840
And what the point
what a Scrum Master does here.

2527
02:07:32,120 --> 02:07:34,080
They will take notes here.

2528
02:07:34,080 --> 02:07:39,800
Okay, The test be your user story or
something that you need to test is behind.

2529
02:07:39,800 --> 02:07:41,800
Let me talk to the developer. What is

2530
02:07:42,880 --> 02:07:44,560
why are they all standing?

2531
02:07:44,560 --> 02:07:45,920
It's called a standard meeting.

2532
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:48,320
I don't know why
it's called a standard meeting.

2533
02:07:48,320 --> 02:07:50,160
It can be done standing up.

2534
02:07:50,160 --> 02:07:52,520
It can be done in a conference room
sitting down, but

2535
02:07:53,080 --> 02:07:55,360
it usually takes 15 minutes.

2536
02:07:55,360 --> 02:07:57,880
Can it go all 15 minutes? Absolutely.

2537
02:07:57,880 --> 02:07:59,480
It can go over 15 minutes.

2538
02:07:59,480 --> 02:08:02,600
All but typically 15, 20 minutes.

2539
02:08:02,920 --> 02:08:04,320
You try to keep it short.

2540
02:08:04,320 --> 02:08:06,080
Everyone goes give a quick status.

2541
02:08:06,080 --> 02:08:10,440
And if there's any problems,
they try to make sure they work on this.

2542
02:08:10,440 --> 02:08:15,120
Now, in this meeting,
there are some people who love to talk

2543
02:08:16,320 --> 02:08:18,360
and there are some people
who love to talk.

2544
02:08:18,360 --> 02:08:18,880
Right.

2545
02:08:18,960 --> 02:08:22,880
And a scrum master will usually say,
you know what, This is a

2546
02:08:23,280 --> 02:08:24,480
they call it what do they call it?

2547
02:08:24,480 --> 02:08:27,360
This is a parking log item
they call a parking lot.

2548
02:08:27,400 --> 02:08:31,480
I don't know why they call it,
but that means that, hey, this whatever

2549
02:08:31,480 --> 02:08:34,720
your issue is, let's talk about this
or do a separate meeting

2550
02:08:34,720 --> 02:08:37,280
because it's a longer one. Right now.
We need to go.

2551
02:08:37,280 --> 02:08:42,200
Everyone needs to give the status right?

2552
02:08:42,200 --> 02:08:43,600
Yeah. They don't use their phone.

2553
02:08:43,600 --> 02:08:45,720
Maybe that could be the reason. Yeah.

2554
02:08:45,720 --> 02:08:49,080
Sometimes not all the testers,
they maybe one representative goes there

2555
02:08:49,080 --> 02:08:50,520
and gives the status right. What?

2556
02:08:50,520 --> 02:08:54,880
But typically this is what you do.

2557
02:08:54,880 --> 02:08:57,440
Yeah. It's something
that's basically taking too long.

2558
02:08:57,600 --> 02:09:00,400
And that happens by the way,
it happens all the time

2559
02:09:00,720 --> 02:09:04,800
where someone likes to talk so much like,
Geez, okay buddy, let's move on.

2560
02:09:04,800 --> 02:09:09,640
You know, people give their status.

2561
02:09:09,640 --> 02:09:09,840
Yeah.

2562
02:09:10,840 --> 02:09:11,360
All right.

2563
02:09:11,360 --> 02:09:13,120
So this is your daily stand up.

2564
02:09:13,120 --> 02:09:15,880
So when you go in the morning, right,
you check your meetings,

2565
02:09:16,240 --> 02:09:20,000
so you check your emails and everything,
and then a specific time lapse

2566
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:23,040
in 930 in the morning,
you go to conference room or whatever, or

2567
02:09:23,040 --> 02:09:25,920
maybe on a Zoom call
and everyone gives the status, right?

2568
02:09:26,240 --> 02:09:29,600
That Scrum
Master is the one initiating it.

2569
02:09:29,600 --> 02:09:32,880
So they able to say like, All right, guys,
let's start our scrum meeting today.

2570
02:09:33,600 --> 02:09:37,840
Jon Developer Let's say, for example,
could you tell us what you worked on?

2571
02:09:38,520 --> 02:09:40,760
Yes. Jon would be like,
Yeah, I worked on this, blah, blah, blah.

2572
02:09:40,760 --> 02:09:43,040
I'm working on this no matter what. Right.
Thank you.

2573
02:09:43,040 --> 02:09:45,760
If there's any notes, any issues
he brings up

2574
02:09:46,600 --> 02:09:50,240
or she Scrum
Master will basically take the notes

2575
02:09:50,240 --> 02:09:52,600
and then most likely
come up with a solution

2576
02:09:52,840 --> 02:09:57,240
or bring it to a product or after everyone
goes, gives their 30 seconds

2577
02:09:57,240 --> 02:10:00,240
one minute
whatever talk and that's it and move on.

2578
02:10:00,440 --> 02:10:04,000
So this happens every single morning,
every single morning.

2579
02:10:04,240 --> 02:10:06,400
Very first thing you do
when you go to work.

2580
02:10:06,400 --> 02:10:06,720
Yeah.

2581
02:10:06,720 --> 02:10:10,560
After check your emails daily
stand up 15 minutes long.

2582
02:10:10,600 --> 02:10:11,480
Can it go longer?

2583
02:10:11,480 --> 02:10:13,880
Sure it can, but typically is 15 minutes.

2584
02:10:14,160 --> 02:10:16,880
I remember in the company that I worked
at, it used to be 30 minutes.

2585
02:10:16,880 --> 02:10:19,280
I have no idea why
they call them some agile,

2586
02:10:19,280 --> 02:10:23,040
but they were not really following because
30 minutes is not according to Agile.

2587
02:10:23,040 --> 02:10:27,240
But remember I said people can adapt,
companies can adapt, right?

2588
02:10:27,480 --> 02:10:28,840
So does it make sense?

2589
02:10:28,840 --> 02:10:30,360
Pretty straightforward, right? Sprint

2590
02:10:31,320 --> 02:10:34,760
daily stand up.

2591
02:10:34,760 --> 02:10:37,160
So this is what you will do.
You will get used to this.

2592
02:10:37,360 --> 02:10:38,440
Very simple.

2593
02:10:38,440 --> 02:10:40,720
Now let's see,
what were some of the other meetings?

2594
02:10:40,720 --> 02:10:42,600
Okay, let's see. Yes.

2595
02:10:42,600 --> 02:10:43,640
Sprint grooming.

2596
02:10:43,640 --> 02:10:44,760
This is very important meeting.

2597
02:10:44,760 --> 02:10:45,440
Okay.

2598
02:10:45,480 --> 02:10:48,400
So let's say, for example,
we did daily training.

2599
02:10:48,640 --> 02:10:51,320
So let's say before a sprint
starts, right?

2600
02:10:51,320 --> 02:10:53,120
Maybe you have some questions.

2601
02:10:53,120 --> 02:10:56,080
You at these user stories
and you have no idea.

2602
02:10:56,400 --> 02:10:58,120
Let's say let me open something.

2603
02:10:58,120 --> 02:11:00,440
Don't get scared
or anything in my look complicated.

2604
02:11:00,440 --> 02:11:01,280
Let's see.

2605
02:11:01,280 --> 02:11:05,040
Let's say, for example, you has a
developer is looking at as an admin.

2606
02:11:05,040 --> 02:11:07,720
I should be able to change
employee details, blah blah.

2607
02:11:07,760 --> 02:11:10,200
I have no idea
what in the world you want me.

2608
02:11:10,240 --> 02:11:11,800
Let's say you don't understand
this, right?

2609
02:11:11,800 --> 02:11:14,680
Let's say this user story
and your developer tester.

2610
02:11:14,680 --> 02:11:18,000
You can't understand a word
what the business

2611
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:21,600
and as a product owner has written
or you have some confusion on this.

2612
02:11:21,600 --> 02:11:24,240
For example, you have a meeting for this.

2613
02:11:24,600 --> 02:11:26,920
Now, this is what happened,
spring grooming meeting.

2614
02:11:27,160 --> 02:11:29,280
So this is before the spring starts.

2615
02:11:29,640 --> 02:11:32,480
Or sometimes you do this meeting
ahead of time,

2616
02:11:32,480 --> 02:11:35,480
the future sprints before a sprint start.

2617
02:11:35,480 --> 02:11:39,120
Let's say you're going to start
your new sprint on the 22nd, right?

2618
02:11:39,440 --> 02:11:43,440
Maybe on the 18 to 19,
you do sprint grooming meeting.

2619
02:11:43,760 --> 02:11:47,520
In this meeting, first of all, development
team, that means testers,

2620
02:11:47,520 --> 02:11:50,960
developer, business aspect,
master, product owner, everyone is here.

2621
02:11:50,960 --> 02:11:55,480
B Sprint product owner and team represent
arrange it in the middle sprint time.

2622
02:11:55,760 --> 02:11:59,080
In this case planning and fighting term
that happened on the same day

2623
02:11:59,480 --> 02:12:02,480
led led by the product where the involves

2624
02:12:02,800 --> 02:12:07,800
splitting big item into smaller
smaller ones, reiterating back

2625
02:12:07,960 --> 02:12:12,360
items to be more expressive,
deleting obsolete or no more neat items.

2626
02:12:12,360 --> 02:12:12,880
Right.

2627
02:12:12,880 --> 02:12:15,880
So what happens in this meeting in spring

2628
02:12:15,880 --> 02:12:19,640
grooming basically
when you looked at this one right

2629
02:12:19,640 --> 02:12:23,360
this picture here
some user stories can be massive, right?

2630
02:12:23,640 --> 02:12:25,240
That might take a long time.

2631
02:12:25,240 --> 02:12:28,160
So what happens this sometimes is like,
you know what, let's split

2632
02:12:28,160 --> 02:12:31,160
this between three or four people
or let's break it down

2633
02:12:31,160 --> 02:12:34,560
into longer time so they can
they can break it down.

2634
02:12:34,800 --> 02:12:39,200
But the main thing that happens
in this meeting, you're trying to clarify

2635
02:12:39,200 --> 02:12:43,080
and understand
exact what these user stories are.

2636
02:12:43,400 --> 02:12:46,080
Maybe, for example,
let's let's let's go back here.

2637
02:12:46,400 --> 02:12:48,920
You in the product backlog here,
you looking at this one,

2638
02:12:49,160 --> 02:12:54,120
maybe this used to use a story
is not accurate or needs more details.

2639
02:12:54,120 --> 02:12:54,640
Right.

2640
02:12:54,680 --> 02:12:58,920
In this grooming meeting, the grooming
meetings can be two, three, 4 hours long.

2641
02:12:59,160 --> 02:13:00,120
They can take long.

2642
02:13:00,120 --> 02:13:01,560
As long as it takes.

2643
02:13:01,560 --> 02:13:03,720
Before you start working in a sprint.

2644
02:13:03,720 --> 02:13:08,320
You have to understand everyone needs
to understand what each user story is.

2645
02:13:08,560 --> 02:13:12,560
Maybe a developer question,
maybe you have a question, right?

2646
02:13:12,560 --> 02:13:14,120
I tester has a question, right?

2647
02:13:14,120 --> 02:13:17,320
So what you do in this meeting is clear.

2648
02:13:17,320 --> 02:13:19,960
All five basically all of this right?

2649
02:13:20,160 --> 02:13:23,920
To understand I might have some question
I might not understand is used to it all

2650
02:13:24,600 --> 02:13:28,520
product owner in business and said hey
can you tell me what in the world is this?

2651
02:13:28,520 --> 02:13:29,560
What am I supposed to do?

2652
02:13:29,560 --> 02:13:31,880
If you ask this, you clarify.

2653
02:13:32,120 --> 02:13:34,000
Maybe you would delete some users history.

2654
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:35,720
Okay, this doesn't make sense.

2655
02:13:35,720 --> 02:13:37,440
Let's take it out, guys. Whatever.

2656
02:13:37,440 --> 02:13:41,400
So in this meeting, spring grooming,
you are basically clarifying

2657
02:13:41,400 --> 02:13:46,160
and understanding all the user stories
before you get to actually work on it.

2658
02:13:46,160 --> 02:13:46,680
Right?

2659
02:13:47,040 --> 02:13:50,240
Makes sense, guys.

2660
02:13:50,240 --> 02:13:52,680
Pretty straightforward understanding,

2661
02:13:52,920 --> 02:13:56,400
making some of the user stories
that might take a long time

2662
02:13:56,640 --> 02:14:00,920
into smaller ones and really understanding
and asking questions and things.

2663
02:14:01,280 --> 02:14:04,840
And I remember when you guys joined
the project, let's say at the beginning,

2664
02:14:04,840 --> 02:14:07,600
don't be like, no one is expecting you
to know anything at that point.

2665
02:14:07,880 --> 02:14:12,160
At the very beginning, when you join,
it might be they will give you some

2666
02:14:12,160 --> 02:14:14,640
because you're not familiar
with the application.

2667
02:14:15,160 --> 02:14:18,520
But here basically what we do,
we are understanding

2668
02:14:18,840 --> 02:14:22,400
exactly
what is what we're going to create.

2669
02:14:22,400 --> 02:14:26,160
If we don't understand, we clarify,
we take out things, we add things,

2670
02:14:26,160 --> 02:14:29,760
we add more details, we add pictures,
whatever needs to be done,

2671
02:14:30,120 --> 02:14:33,320
and this is amongst
the entire chip can take 2 hours,

2672
02:14:33,600 --> 02:14:36,640
it can take 3
hours, can take 4 hours, can take 8 hours.

2673
02:14:36,640 --> 02:14:38,160
Depend on how long sprints.

2674
02:14:38,160 --> 02:14:38,680
All right.

2675
02:14:38,680 --> 02:14:41,160
So let's see if we have a two week sprint.

2676
02:14:41,360 --> 02:14:42,560
Maybe we'll take 3 hours.

2677
02:14:42,560 --> 02:14:44,720
What if the company has three weeks
sprint, right?

2678
02:14:44,960 --> 02:14:47,000
That means there's
going to be a lot of you stories.

2679
02:14:47,320 --> 02:14:49,280
More like it's
going to take four or 5 hours

2680
02:14:50,640 --> 02:14:51,440
in this meeting.

2681
02:14:51,440 --> 02:14:52,920
You're sitting down. Yeah.

2682
02:14:52,920 --> 02:14:54,200
Only the daily stand up.

2683
02:14:54,200 --> 02:14:56,760
Maybe you are standing up.

2684
02:14:56,760 --> 02:14:59,280
This is where you absolutely started
sitting down.

2685
02:14:59,280 --> 02:15:00,400
And you have a projector.

2686
02:15:00,400 --> 02:15:03,440
You're looking at the user stories,
trying to understand something.

2687
02:15:03,440 --> 02:15:06,240
If you sleep, you're not doing much,
you understand everything.

2688
02:15:06,440 --> 02:15:07,680
But whatever, you know, you get the.

2689
02:15:07,680 --> 02:15:10,680
Point is just to clarify all the user

2690
02:15:10,680 --> 02:15:14,080
stories, the requirements
right before we start working on them

2691
02:15:14,280 --> 02:15:16,800
and questions come along,
you might not understand something.

2692
02:15:17,280 --> 02:15:18,640
Developer might not have started.

2693
02:15:18,640 --> 02:15:22,800
Maybe the business analyst and product
owner wrote the user story in a

2694
02:15:23,120 --> 02:15:26,240
I don't know, in a poorly written
English guide.

2695
02:15:26,280 --> 02:15:28,800
You might want to clarify that.
What in the world you want me to do?

2696
02:15:29,120 --> 02:15:32,840
You asked these questions here
in the spring grooming session, basically.

2697
02:15:33,080 --> 02:15:38,720
So we cover this Now remember
spring grooming look pre confusing,

2698
02:15:38,720 --> 02:15:42,400
but it's just a meeting where we clarify
all the details and break down

2699
02:15:42,600 --> 02:15:45,520
some of the user stories
down to smaller ones.

2700
02:15:45,840 --> 02:15:48,360
So we cover daily scrum.

2701
02:15:48,360 --> 02:15:49,960
Then we did spring grooming.

2702
02:15:49,960 --> 02:15:51,480
Well, shoot, let's go back

2703
02:15:53,760 --> 02:15:56,760
then we're going to have spring planning.

2704
02:15:56,760 --> 02:15:58,640
The order is a little out of whack.

2705
02:15:58,640 --> 02:16:02,160
Let's see what comes up this.

2706
02:16:02,160 --> 02:16:04,880
Okay, now we have another meeting.

2707
02:16:05,280 --> 02:16:08,520
So now that we have understood,
for example,

2708
02:16:08,760 --> 02:16:11,280
what the user stories
we understood what they are

2709
02:16:11,560 --> 02:16:13,800
Now we're going to go to another meeting

2710
02:16:14,280 --> 02:16:17,160
that is called Sprint Planning.

2711
02:16:17,160 --> 02:16:23,000
Now. And Nicola,
I don't know why they call

2712
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,800
it standard me, but a lot of companies
do do it standard, right?

2713
02:16:26,040 --> 02:16:30,360
So now that you have understood
all the users pre, now there's a meeting

2714
02:16:30,360 --> 02:16:32,600
called spring planning the same people

2715
02:16:32,600 --> 02:16:35,720
are going to be the happens
at the beginning of this year

2716
02:16:36,200 --> 02:16:39,440
the Sprint team
meeting to discuss user stories in task.

2717
02:16:39,440 --> 02:16:42,960
What do they do here
they are basically now in this

2718
02:16:44,120 --> 02:16:45,840
sprint planning meeting

2719
02:16:45,840 --> 02:16:48,240
all the let's say sprint

2720
02:16:49,680 --> 02:16:51,280
what's the sprint backlog

2721
02:16:51,280 --> 02:16:55,000
is identified
and actually created basically.

2722
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:58,360
Right so here finalize we finalized

2723
02:16:58,400 --> 02:17:01,440
basically all these user stories.

2724
02:17:01,440 --> 02:17:04,640
We finalize all of these in this course.

2725
02:17:04,640 --> 02:17:05,720
We understood

2726
02:17:05,720 --> 02:17:09,800
now we finalized some of them
and now we're going to do something else.

2727
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,120
An important part

2728
02:17:12,440 --> 02:17:15,760
is to estimate
what do you guys think that means?

2729
02:17:16,160 --> 02:17:20,480
Take a wild guess. Yes.

2730
02:17:20,480 --> 02:17:23,600
This is very, very important part.

2731
02:17:24,720 --> 02:17:28,480
Estimating meaning is, okay,
all these usage that he was team.

2732
02:17:28,760 --> 02:17:29,440
Okay.

2733
02:17:29,520 --> 02:17:32,760
Remember this a sprint is
let's say two weeks, for example.

2734
02:17:32,760 --> 02:17:33,280
Right.

2735
02:17:33,600 --> 02:17:36,680
So how much work should you get,
let's say for two weeks?

2736
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:40,600
How many hours are there,
let's say in a working day, let's say in a

2737
02:17:40,680 --> 02:17:44,160
in a week,
40 hours rate, 40 hours of work,

2738
02:17:44,160 --> 02:17:47,480
basically go for,
let's say, 9 to 5 full time job, right?

2739
02:17:47,480 --> 02:17:49,960
So two weeks
sprint would be 80 hours. Right.

2740
02:17:50,240 --> 02:17:54,320
So now what they need to do
is they need to identify

2741
02:17:54,320 --> 02:17:57,760
how long each user story going to take,

2742
02:17:58,880 --> 02:17:59,240
write

2743
02:17:59,400 --> 02:18:02,200
each user
story because they need to assign

2744
02:18:02,200 --> 02:18:05,400
that work to individual,
let's say developer and tester.

2745
02:18:05,400 --> 02:18:05,840
Right?

2746
02:18:05,840 --> 02:18:11,920
So in this sprint planning,
what we do is we break down the story.

2747
02:18:12,120 --> 02:18:12,960
So. Right.

2748
02:18:12,960 --> 02:18:15,640
For example, let's look at this
as an example right now.

2749
02:18:15,640 --> 02:18:16,960
Okay.

2750
02:18:16,960 --> 02:18:21,080
Some companies use points,
some companies use hours and days.

2751
02:18:21,080 --> 02:18:22,960
It all depends on the company.

2752
02:18:22,960 --> 02:18:26,280
One could meet one point,
could mean in a company

2753
02:18:26,520 --> 02:18:29,440
it's a small use, a story
that mean it's not going to take too long.

2754
02:18:29,920 --> 02:18:31,640
A medium could mean three points.

2755
02:18:31,640 --> 02:18:32,960
Let's say, for example,

2756
02:18:32,960 --> 02:18:36,960
it will take a little time, maybe four
or 5 hours, but it's nothing difficult.

2757
02:18:37,280 --> 02:18:38,440
Five point could mean

2758
02:18:38,440 --> 02:18:41,920
it could take a lot of effort rate
or sometimes what they could do.

2759
02:18:42,200 --> 02:18:44,520
Each user story can basically gets

2760
02:18:45,800 --> 02:18:46,440
a timing.

2761
02:18:46,440 --> 02:18:47,720
Who creates user story?

2762
02:18:47,720 --> 02:18:49,680
Guys, answer this question for him.

2763
02:18:49,680 --> 02:18:53,800
Who creates user stories?

2764
02:18:53,800 --> 02:18:56,520
Product owner slash business analyst.

2765
02:18:56,680 --> 02:19:00,280
Remember that people and business owners
who are the one taking

2766
02:19:00,280 --> 02:19:04,160
all the notes, write
all the done by business owners, right?

2767
02:19:04,400 --> 02:19:08,160
So remember people in business
and so the one creating this right.

2768
02:19:08,400 --> 02:19:11,680
So now what
we are basically doing in this meeting

2769
02:19:11,960 --> 02:19:16,040
after we have clarified all that
the user stories,

2770
02:19:16,280 --> 02:19:21,560
we got an estimate we got to give it
and in the we how it works is this way.

2771
02:19:21,560 --> 02:19:24,920
So let's say for example each user story,
let's take

2772
02:19:24,920 --> 02:19:27,320
for example
this use history right now, right?

2773
02:19:28,400 --> 02:19:32,320
So let's say Scrum master
we'll this up on a projector

2774
02:19:32,320 --> 02:19:35,440
and show it to everyone right guys
you guys understand this user story

2775
02:19:36,080 --> 02:19:38,400
developer and test you understand.
Okay, great.

2776
02:19:38,400 --> 02:19:40,920
Now developer
first developers will go right

2777
02:19:41,200 --> 02:19:45,120
They'll ask each developer,
let's say this for developer, developer,

2778
02:19:45,480 --> 02:19:48,840
how long do you think it will take you
to develop this user story?

2779
02:19:49,240 --> 02:19:51,920
Some might say it might take me 3 hours
to develop this.

2780
02:19:51,920 --> 02:19:52,440
Okay.

2781
02:19:52,440 --> 02:19:53,960
Now, remember,
they're guessing at this point,

2782
02:19:53,960 --> 02:19:56,880
no one knows how long,
but you're estimating at this point,

2783
02:19:57,200 --> 02:19:59,600
another developer might say
it might take 5 hours.

2784
02:20:00,080 --> 02:20:03,680
Another developer might say,
I think it might take 8 hours.

2785
02:20:03,680 --> 02:20:05,880
Okay, everyone, to give a different time.

2786
02:20:05,880 --> 02:20:06,680
Okay.

2787
02:20:06,680 --> 02:20:10,640
The product, the sorry,
the Scrum masters to be like, okay, guys,

2788
02:20:10,640 --> 02:20:14,400
each of you gave me different timing for
how can you explain to me

2789
02:20:14,400 --> 02:20:15,920
why you think it takes 3 hours?

2790
02:20:15,920 --> 02:20:19,120
Can you tell me why it takes 8 hours
after the explanation?

2791
02:20:19,120 --> 02:20:20,400
Let's see. Each will give.

2792
02:20:20,400 --> 02:20:21,040
All right, guys.

2793
02:20:21,040 --> 02:20:24,880
Now, each one of you heard
what you guys think your opinions are.

2794
02:20:25,080 --> 02:20:26,760
Now let's go back again.

2795
02:20:26,760 --> 02:20:28,520
How long do you guys think so?

2796
02:20:28,520 --> 02:20:30,400
They will go back each and every one.

2797
02:20:30,400 --> 02:20:33,680
Each developer will go and say, okay,
I think it's going to take 4 hours.

2798
02:20:33,880 --> 02:20:36,240
The other might say 5 hours.
They might say 4 hours.

2799
02:20:36,240 --> 02:20:40,040
Okay, let's do an average
guys is going to take 4 hours, right?

2800
02:20:40,200 --> 02:20:44,240
So now they will give four hour time
for this user story

2801
02:20:44,440 --> 02:20:48,000
that the developer needs to develop
and create this.

2802
02:20:48,160 --> 02:20:53,000
That means he at least 4 hours, this user
story has at least 4 hours of work.

2803
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:53,480
Right.

2804
02:20:53,840 --> 02:20:55,960
Then after this, what happens,
do you think?

2805
02:20:56,280 --> 02:20:59,280
Now, remember,
that was the time for the developer

2806
02:21:02,400 --> 02:21:04,920
testers will give their own timing now.

2807
02:21:05,200 --> 02:21:07,960
Now the testers will go and say this.

2808
02:21:07,960 --> 02:21:12,200
Okay, Remember, sometimes development
can take a lot longer than testing.

2809
02:21:12,520 --> 02:21:14,760
Now the timing would be separate
for testers.

2810
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:18,320
So this will have, let's say, for example,
developer time.

2811
02:21:18,320 --> 02:21:20,840
It'll have a tester, tap testers go.

2812
02:21:20,840 --> 02:21:24,760
I think it's going to take me 4 hours,
some of my samples and take 5 hours.

2813
02:21:24,920 --> 02:21:26,600
Whatever they're using,
they'll give explanation

2814
02:21:26,600 --> 02:21:28,520
and then they'll come to an average.

2815
02:21:28,520 --> 02:21:30,680
Okay, It's going to take 4 hours for you
guys.

2816
02:21:30,680 --> 02:21:34,720
Well, so now in this meeting,
they're going to basically, guys,

2817
02:21:35,320 --> 02:21:37,520
let's go to spend backlog, right?

2818
02:21:37,840 --> 02:21:42,280
They're going to go each and every user
story that they're going to have.

2819
02:21:42,680 --> 02:21:47,280
Each and every single story
is going to have a developer time

2820
02:21:47,560 --> 02:21:50,280
and is going to have a testers.

2821
02:21:50,280 --> 02:21:55,080
How much to test right now,
this task, this this whole estimating

2822
02:21:55,080 --> 02:21:57,680
and everything's been planning
could take a couple of hours,

2823
02:21:57,680 --> 02:22:00,920
2 to 3, 4 hours
depending on how many users story.

2824
02:22:00,920 --> 02:22:03,320
The more it is, the longer time will take.

2825
02:22:03,480 --> 02:22:06,920
So now you get an idea, guys,
when you go to 9 to 5,

2826
02:22:07,200 --> 02:22:11,080
you're not just coding 24 seven,
you're not 40 hours of coding.

2827
02:22:11,320 --> 02:22:14,560
If you have a lot of meetings,
you have a lot of other things going on.

2828
02:22:14,560 --> 02:22:17,520
Remember that maybe some time
the entire day can be spent

2829
02:22:17,840 --> 02:22:20,040
on just estimating things
like that. Right?

2830
02:22:20,040 --> 02:22:23,040
So let's go back over here now.

2831
02:22:23,280 --> 02:22:27,560
Once you time everything right, let's say
it's going to take this long to develop

2832
02:22:27,800 --> 02:22:33,160
or this long to once that time is given,
right, then what happens is

2833
02:22:34,480 --> 02:22:35,520
each team

2834
02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:38,840
member, let's say developers,
be by themself.

2835
02:22:38,840 --> 02:22:42,880
Okay, I'm going to work on this item
just to make it sure that it's 80

2836
02:22:42,880 --> 02:22:43,800
hours, right?

2837
02:22:43,800 --> 02:22:46,600
You pick the items you as a team, right?

2838
02:22:46,840 --> 02:22:50,160
Each and every person need that product
order

2839
02:22:50,280 --> 02:22:54,440
need a Scrum master assigns
you usually the team itself.

2840
02:22:54,440 --> 02:22:55,720
Let's say there's a senior developer.

2841
02:22:55,720 --> 02:22:58,760
Okay, guys,
I think this is a four day long

2842
02:22:59,680 --> 02:23:02,080
user story is going to take me a week
to develop this.

2843
02:23:02,360 --> 02:23:03,000
I'll take this.

2844
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:06,240
Since I'm a senior person,
everyone picks themself.

2845
02:23:06,280 --> 02:23:10,120
Usually that's I was when you start
at a new company, you're brand new.

2846
02:23:10,120 --> 02:23:11,160
You have no idea.

2847
02:23:11,160 --> 02:23:14,760
Don't worry, they won't make you pick it
because you don't know at the beginning.

2848
02:23:14,760 --> 02:23:15,520
They'll give you okay

2849
02:23:15,520 --> 02:23:20,440
you John New person, you work on these two
or three users story.

2850
02:23:20,440 --> 02:23:21,840
They're easy at the beginning,

2851
02:23:21,840 --> 02:23:26,320
but you as a team, for example,
each person picks their own one.

2852
02:23:26,520 --> 02:23:29,600
So testers, testers might say, you know,
I think I'll work

2853
02:23:29,600 --> 02:23:32,640
on this, this, this user
story values during values story.

2854
02:23:32,840 --> 02:23:33,640
Okay, great.

2855
02:23:33,640 --> 02:23:35,640
Someone else will be like,
I'll work on this one.

2856
02:23:35,640 --> 02:23:39,440
So you yourself pick all of these
which stories you're going to work

2857
02:23:39,640 --> 02:23:41,760
when you pick them, for example. Right?

2858
02:23:41,960 --> 02:23:42,480
Whenever.

2859
02:23:42,480 --> 02:23:45,320
Let's say the sprint starts,
let's say sprint planning.

2860
02:23:45,320 --> 02:23:49,440
Everything happened on the 20
of September, let's say the following day.

2861
02:23:49,440 --> 02:23:52,360
22nd is when the sprint is going to start.

2862
02:23:52,360 --> 02:23:53,960
That means developing testing.

2863
02:23:53,960 --> 02:23:58,000
Then you will come when you come to log
into JIRA, all the user stories,

2864
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,280
whatever was assigned,
let's say that you picked

2865
02:24:00,280 --> 02:24:03,640
will show up in your, for example,
in your dashboard.

2866
02:24:03,640 --> 02:24:04,120
Right.

2867
02:24:04,120 --> 02:24:08,720
And that's how you work usually works
like, does it make sense how this works?

2868
02:24:09,240 --> 02:24:11,240
It's a very democratic process.

2869
02:24:11,480 --> 02:24:12,840
If you haven't seen so far.

2870
02:24:12,840 --> 02:24:16,000
It's very democratic,
very involved in here

2871
02:24:16,240 --> 02:24:19,960
where you much in what everyone say,
what they want to do,

2872
02:24:19,960 --> 02:24:21,480
what they don't want to do,
whatever it is.

2873
02:24:21,480 --> 02:24:25,560
You know, it's a very team effort,
you see, and no one is assigning.

2874
02:24:25,560 --> 02:24:27,240
There's no micromanagement.

2875
02:24:27,240 --> 02:24:31,200
But at the same time, they're trying
to really do team building work,

2876
02:24:31,440 --> 02:24:34,760
try to do everything,
give enough time to understand things

2877
02:24:34,760 --> 02:24:36,040
and not make it pressure.

2878
02:24:36,040 --> 02:24:39,360
They want to make efficient
with these meetings and things.

2879
02:24:39,560 --> 02:24:42,920
Supposedly everything's supposed to go
smooth and you have an understanding

2880
02:24:43,160 --> 02:24:44,720
and you can achieve this stuff.

2881
02:24:44,720 --> 02:24:47,680
So this happens in the sprint planning.

2882
02:24:48,920 --> 02:24:50,880
So what did we cover so far?

2883
02:24:50,880 --> 02:24:55,320
Let's see, we covered daily standup,
which is the 15 minute long meeting.

2884
02:24:55,640 --> 02:25:00,000
Sprint, GroupMe, where we basically
understand the user stories.

2885
02:25:01,080 --> 02:25:03,240
If we need to delete them,
try to understand,

2886
02:25:03,240 --> 02:25:06,800
take out things, make smaller,
use destroy, meaning smaller, task.

2887
02:25:06,800 --> 02:25:09,240
We do all of that in sprint planning.

2888
02:25:09,240 --> 02:25:13,760
We finalize exactly all the user story
that we're going to be working on.

2889
02:25:14,040 --> 02:25:17,520
Also, we're estimating
giving it and everything.

2890
02:25:17,520 --> 02:25:21,120
And then at the same time we're choosing
which items

2891
02:25:21,120 --> 02:25:24,800
I'm going to be working as a tester
developer at the same time as well.

2892
02:25:25,280 --> 02:25:27,920
So we cover three of them so far.

2893
02:25:27,920 --> 02:25:31,680
Pretty easy,
am I or not already challenging.

2894
02:25:32,960 --> 02:25:34,720
Easy, right? Pretty simple.

2895
02:25:34,720 --> 02:25:38,520
Just a lot of terminology,
but it's pretty simple analysis.

2896
02:25:38,520 --> 02:25:39,840
Soon you're going to understand

2897
02:25:39,840 --> 02:25:42,760
this picture that I showed you,
so it will make a lot of sense.

2898
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:43,720
Okay.

2899
02:25:43,720 --> 02:25:46,320
Now, basically, let's say
Sprint will start.

2900
02:25:46,320 --> 02:25:48,360
Let's see.
You've done all your meetings, etc..

2901
02:25:48,640 --> 02:25:49,560
Everything is good.

2902
02:25:49,560 --> 02:25:51,680
You've done
all the estimation, everything.

2903
02:25:51,880 --> 02:25:53,720
Now sprint the start two weeks.

2904
02:25:53,720 --> 02:25:56,960
So basically go
by two weeks in the two weeks.

2905
02:25:57,080 --> 02:26:00,240
Every day you have daily stand up
and you're working, blah, blah, blah.

2906
02:26:00,240 --> 02:26:02,160
You developing your testing every day.

2907
02:26:02,160 --> 02:26:04,800
Now what happens
after the end of the two weeks?

2908
02:26:04,800 --> 02:26:11,880
What do you think happens?

2909
02:26:11,880 --> 02:26:12,600
Review meeting.

2910
02:26:12,600 --> 02:26:16,200
Okay,
so now we have Sprint demo slash review

2911
02:26:16,200 --> 02:26:19,520
meeting, right in this meeting,
not everyone is here, right?

2912
02:26:19,920 --> 02:26:24,240
So developer scrum, massive business,
all of you, the client side is here.

2913
02:26:24,240 --> 02:26:26,920
Maybe they'll come on Zoom
or on site, for example.

2914
02:26:27,240 --> 02:26:29,000
And this happens right after the spring.

2915
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:34,760
And here now typically led by a RSM
EY or Tesla.

2916
02:26:34,760 --> 02:26:39,320
I'll explain to you what it s
I mean subject matter expert.

2917
02:26:39,320 --> 02:26:40,440
That means someone who's

2918
02:26:40,440 --> 02:26:43,880
a very senior person
who's probably from the beginning of the

2919
02:26:44,280 --> 02:26:47,640
or the project, someone who could be
a developer, it could be a tester.

2920
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:51,240
A test
lead is usually a very senior tester.

2921
02:26:51,240 --> 02:26:51,680
Right?

2922
02:26:51,680 --> 02:26:54,680
So let's say you're
I've been in this company for four years

2923
02:26:54,680 --> 02:26:57,840
and four or two other testers got hired.

2924
02:26:58,040 --> 02:27:00,240
They're junior people
under automatic testing,

2925
02:27:00,240 --> 02:27:02,800
someone who's more in charge,
a more senior. Right.

2926
02:27:03,120 --> 02:27:06,760
So they're one
usually leading this meeting.

2927
02:27:06,760 --> 02:27:12,280
Right now, in this meeting,
what happens is what ever was developed

2928
02:27:12,280 --> 02:27:18,640
in this thing by hey,
let's look at a sprint.

2929
02:27:18,640 --> 02:27:20,480
Whatever was in that section, right?

2930
02:27:20,480 --> 02:27:23,000
Let's say supposedly
everything is done right.

2931
02:27:23,480 --> 02:27:26,960
Everything that was created,
we're showing them a demo.

2932
02:27:26,960 --> 02:27:28,640
We're going one by one

2933
02:27:28,640 --> 02:27:31,400
and showing them, okay,
this is the new functionality created.

2934
02:27:31,600 --> 02:27:34,800
We added a login page,
we built a posting page, blah, blah, blah.

2935
02:27:35,040 --> 02:27:38,120
You go one by one
and show it to the client.

2936
02:27:38,120 --> 02:27:40,280
You show it to exactly what you created.

2937
02:27:40,520 --> 02:27:42,520
Usually a tester does this.

2938
02:27:42,520 --> 02:27:46,240
Why the tester usually showcase this
because they're the one

2939
02:27:46,240 --> 02:27:47,480
who is more experienced

2940
02:27:47,480 --> 02:27:50,280
in playing out with the application,
finding flaws and everything.

2941
02:27:50,600 --> 02:27:52,200
So very easy.

2942
02:27:52,200 --> 02:27:54,720
A test lead,
usually that's a senior person.

2943
02:27:54,720 --> 02:27:56,560
So don't expect when you go to work

2944
02:27:56,560 --> 02:27:58,640
that you're going to be doing it
so they'll get freaked out.

2945
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:02,640
They basically show step by step
what they've created

2946
02:28:02,640 --> 02:28:06,480
a bit added, I don't know, a login button
or Instagram button.

2947
02:28:06,640 --> 02:28:08,640
They're going to show that
that's all it is.

2948
02:28:08,640 --> 02:28:09,920
Very simple.

2949
02:28:09,920 --> 02:28:11,120
It could be on a zoom,

2950
02:28:11,120 --> 02:28:14,400
could be a Skype call,
it could be on WebEx or can be persuade.

2951
02:28:14,680 --> 02:28:17,520
So now you show them basically

2952
02:28:17,520 --> 02:28:20,320
what you are creating step by step, show
all that.

2953
02:28:20,600 --> 02:28:23,080
And also what happens in this meeting.

2954
02:28:23,680 --> 02:28:28,160
In this meeting, for example, the meetings
like this, the team members,

2955
02:28:28,520 --> 02:28:32,120
business analyst, product owner,
developers, maybe even not us,

2956
02:28:32,120 --> 02:28:33,000
for example,

2957
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:36,360
we want, but they'll take the notes
if the customer is giving feedback.

2958
02:28:36,360 --> 02:28:37,680
Okay, I don't like this.

2959
02:28:37,680 --> 02:28:39,440
I think this shouldn't be here.

2960
02:28:39,440 --> 02:28:41,840
It should be at the bottom of the screen,
whatever they want.

2961
02:28:41,880 --> 02:28:44,960
Right?
So all that feedback, they take care.

2962
02:28:45,080 --> 02:28:47,680
All that feedback they take
and they're going to put.

2963
02:28:47,680 --> 02:28:50,200
Where do you think that feedback
is going to go?

2964
02:28:50,200 --> 02:28:54,880
Whatever the customer doesn't like
or want that changes the product backlog?

2965
02:28:54,880 --> 02:28:55,840
Absolutely.

2966
02:28:55,840 --> 02:28:58,080
Is Going to go into the product backlog

2967
02:28:58,240 --> 02:29:00,560
and most likely
we're going to work on the future,

2968
02:29:00,720 --> 02:29:03,960
maybe the next sprint or whenever
we need to work on that.

2969
02:29:03,960 --> 02:29:04,960
Right. For example.

2970
02:29:04,960 --> 02:29:10,120
So this what the spring demo slash
sprint review is where you're showcasing

2971
02:29:10,120 --> 02:29:13,560
whatever you created,
you're basically showing it to the client.

2972
02:29:13,920 --> 02:29:14,640
They like it.

2973
02:29:14,640 --> 02:29:18,240
They hate it when they see
you take feedback and that feedback

2974
02:29:18,240 --> 02:29:23,120
goes back
and do this product backlog in the future,

2975
02:29:23,280 --> 02:29:25,560
most likely in the next sprint
or the following sprint.

2976
02:29:25,560 --> 02:29:29,160
Basically pretty straightforward,
not too complicated,

2977
02:29:29,160 --> 02:29:33,560
but usually how it works that don't expect
you guys to be leading the meetings.

2978
02:29:33,960 --> 02:29:36,560
Who takes the notes most of the time?

2979
02:29:36,560 --> 02:29:38,880
Product owner and the business manager.

2980
02:29:38,880 --> 02:29:42,360
Remember, they're the one who makes
what the user story is, right?

2981
02:29:42,600 --> 02:29:44,960
Business analyst is the one
usually writing a product one.

2982
02:29:44,960 --> 02:29:47,680
It helps out as well
do so. They're the one taking the most.

2983
02:29:47,680 --> 02:29:51,280
Maybe some time, you and I developers
and tester can take notes.

2984
02:29:51,280 --> 02:29:55,880
But remember this we are not the ones
writing these user stories.

2985
02:29:55,880 --> 02:29:57,720
No, we don't do all this.

2986
02:29:57,720 --> 02:30:00,880
This is the job of product
owner and business analyst.

2987
02:30:01,160 --> 02:30:03,240
They're adding all this stuff basically.

2988
02:30:04,440 --> 02:30:06,840
So now this meeting is done.

2989
02:30:06,840 --> 02:30:10,120
That means the sprint
has completed At this point,

2990
02:30:10,400 --> 02:30:15,120
while we give the feedback, the feedback
will come most likely the product backlog.

2991
02:30:15,120 --> 02:30:17,320
Then there is one last meeting.

2992
02:30:17,320 --> 02:30:18,360
A lot of meetings,

2993
02:30:18,360 --> 02:30:23,280
a lot of meetings, one more meeting left
after everything is done right.

2994
02:30:23,640 --> 02:30:27,600
And that meeting is called Sprint
retrospective.

2995
02:30:27,600 --> 02:30:31,320
Now Hugh, who is attending development
Team Scrum Master product

2996
02:30:31,320 --> 02:30:34,800
on a business that right after Sprint ends
all the following debt.

2997
02:30:35,120 --> 02:30:38,320
Now in this meeting,
you can be open here, right?

2998
02:30:38,320 --> 02:30:39,480
This is internally.

2999
02:30:39,480 --> 02:30:41,760
There's no client or anything like that.

3000
02:30:41,760 --> 02:30:43,280
What worked, guys?

3001
02:30:43,280 --> 02:30:47,040
What didn't work type of issues
and problem came up in the sprint

3002
02:30:47,840 --> 02:30:51,680
what things we can improve,
what caused the problems

3003
02:30:51,680 --> 02:30:55,160
you're basically expressing
if something went well, great.

3004
02:30:55,440 --> 02:30:57,840
If something didn't go well,
why did it happen?

3005
02:30:57,840 --> 02:30:59,520
It's internal meeting.

3006
02:30:59,520 --> 02:31:00,680
You could even say things.

3007
02:31:00,680 --> 02:31:02,200
Guys, we've been overworked work.

3008
02:31:02,200 --> 02:31:04,560
I think we need a happy hour.

3009
02:31:04,560 --> 02:31:06,120
Literally, you can say anything.

3010
02:31:06,120 --> 02:31:10,400
I even one time I got fed up, I ask for
a raise in my meeting as added a raise.

3011
02:31:10,400 --> 02:31:12,480
Otherwise,
maybe you shouldn't be doing that.

3012
02:31:12,480 --> 02:31:14,280
But still, what is this like?

3013
02:31:14,280 --> 02:31:17,440
You know, in this meeting
you can express yourself,

3014
02:31:17,440 --> 02:31:19,680
You can express yourself and say like,
Hey, look,

3015
02:31:20,280 --> 02:31:23,800
you know, developers, you guys
kind of heard us last time, you know,

3016
02:31:23,800 --> 02:31:27,440
you guys took so long and testers,
we were all crunched up the

3017
02:31:27,960 --> 02:31:31,800
you can expressively openly
basically say things in this meeting

3018
02:31:32,040 --> 02:31:35,600
and what the product owner
and the scrum master what they're doing

3019
02:31:35,880 --> 02:31:39,480
they're basically writing down
all the things they want.

3020
02:31:39,480 --> 02:31:41,640
You do want to hear from you, right?

3021
02:31:41,640 --> 02:31:43,720
So you remember it's
all collaborative, right?

3022
02:31:43,720 --> 02:31:47,520
So if something didn't go well or you guys
were really stressed out or something

3023
02:31:48,120 --> 02:31:51,600
about the project, whatever
you expressed this in this meeting

3024
02:31:51,840 --> 02:31:55,800
and the whole point of this is
to make this team functioning well, right?

3025
02:31:56,120 --> 02:31:57,840
So how can it function?

3026
02:31:57,840 --> 02:31:59,760
Well, they have to hear your concern.

3027
02:31:59,760 --> 02:32:00,960
You have to bend down.

3028
02:32:00,960 --> 02:32:03,960
So if you want to vent out
you went out in this meeting that, hey,

3029
02:32:04,200 --> 02:32:07,600
you know, this is too difficult, whatever
it is, you know, you went down on this

3030
02:32:07,800 --> 02:32:10,760
or you give suggestions, things
that work, things that didn't work.

3031
02:32:10,760 --> 02:32:12,480
And this is strictly internal.

3032
02:32:12,480 --> 02:32:14,520
There's client to anything like that.

3033
02:32:14,760 --> 02:32:18,400
And the goal of this is
how can we improve in the following what

3034
02:32:18,600 --> 02:32:21,160
what things we did
well, what things we can improve,

3035
02:32:21,160 --> 02:32:23,680
and what are some concerns from the team
members? Right.

3036
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:29,000
So it's an open discussion and sometimes,
you know the Scrum master product

3037
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:31,880
winners, they'll make sticky notes
and things like that.

3038
02:32:32,160 --> 02:32:35,200
So now do we understand what's going on?

3039
02:32:35,560 --> 02:32:37,880
Can this get hostile?

3040
02:32:37,880 --> 02:32:40,080
It can be usually doesn't, right?

3041
02:32:40,320 --> 02:32:44,040
Maybe someone got upset or something
sure, comments can be made,

3042
02:32:44,040 --> 02:32:46,920
but but it usually doesn't get a hashtag.

3043
02:32:47,160 --> 02:32:52,560
But this is all the meetings
that we have in Agile Scrum. Now.

3044
02:32:52,560 --> 02:32:57,160
I'm going to go back to this picture
and you're going to understand exactly

3045
02:32:57,400 --> 02:33:00,040
what's going on.
So let me break this down to you.

3046
02:33:00,040 --> 02:33:04,640
Eight inputs from team management,
meaning the client comes to the product

3047
02:33:05,600 --> 02:33:09,440
list requirements prior,
prioritized by business value, etc..

3048
02:33:09,680 --> 02:33:11,800
This is your product backlog right here.

3049
02:33:12,120 --> 02:33:14,120
Then you went to spring planning meeting

3050
02:33:14,880 --> 02:33:17,760
as to how much can be committed, deliver
whatever, etc.

3051
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:21,480
There is no sprint grooming here,
but still sprint planning happens.

3052
02:33:21,480 --> 02:33:24,040
Right now a sprint backlog is created.

3053
02:33:24,040 --> 02:33:26,440
That means one block was taken from here.

3054
02:33:26,440 --> 02:33:30,600
Backlog is broken into little small pieces
and basically given

3055
02:33:30,600 --> 02:33:34,320
to all the members now in here,
I don't know why it says three days.

3056
02:33:34,320 --> 02:33:36,120
Maybe they have a four week sprint.

3057
02:33:36,120 --> 02:33:41,000
But basically right here,
the list end up happening every 24 hours.

3058
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:45,200
That means another meeting is happening
and the whole sprint is in 30 days.

3059
02:33:45,680 --> 02:33:48,960
At the end of 30 days,
you have a sprint preview.

3060
02:33:49,080 --> 02:33:52,440
That means what you from this into that

3061
02:33:52,840 --> 02:33:58,280
then you have a sprint retrospective
and this whole cycle repeats again.

3062
02:33:58,320 --> 02:34:00,920
Now let's
look at it in a easier form format,

3063
02:34:02,600 --> 02:34:05,400
product backlog, sprint planning
happening, right?

3064
02:34:05,400 --> 02:34:07,480
That means Sprint backlog was created.

3065
02:34:07,480 --> 02:34:09,640
That means items were taken from here,

3066
02:34:09,640 --> 02:34:12,760
Scrum team daily scrum happens,
the whole thing happens,

3067
02:34:13,440 --> 02:34:15,840
product is basically made, Sprint review

3068
02:34:15,840 --> 02:34:18,120
happens, a demo was given increment

3069
02:34:19,080 --> 02:34:22,320
Sprint retrospective happens
and the whole cycle repeats again.

3070
02:34:23,280 --> 02:34:24,680
Now do you understand the picture?

3071
02:34:24,680 --> 02:34:27,080
What happens in a in an agile scrum?

3072
02:34:28,400 --> 02:34:31,760
See we identified each
and every single part.

3073
02:34:31,920 --> 02:34:33,120
What does bring back?

3074
02:34:33,120 --> 02:34:33,880
What is this?

3075
02:34:33,880 --> 02:34:37,680
What it's been all the different meetings,
who are the main members

3076
02:34:37,680 --> 02:34:40,200
and what comes up? And yet

3077
02:34:40,680 --> 02:34:44,520
what is an incremental increment
is what you make a product into.

3078
02:34:44,520 --> 02:34:47,000
Small timing in small module plane.

3079
02:34:47,280 --> 02:34:49,440
Remember this in, a sprint,
two weeks sprints.

3080
02:34:49,440 --> 02:34:52,040
We created
some part of the application, right?

3081
02:34:52,600 --> 02:34:54,320
And then we delivered it right.

3082
02:34:54,320 --> 02:34:56,400
So you making it into small pieces.

3083
02:34:56,680 --> 02:34:58,560
Remember this picture
at the very beginning,

3084
02:35:00,360 --> 02:35:01,800
this picture here

3085
02:35:01,800 --> 02:35:05,200
incremental you making in waterfall,
what happens?

3086
02:35:05,720 --> 02:35:08,880
You build the entire project
and then you show it to the client.

3087
02:35:08,880 --> 02:35:10,000
At the very end,

3088
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:15,000
we're building this project into small
pieces, into small in this small sprints

3089
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:18,480
we accomplish and we're getting feedback
This way towards the end.

3090
02:35:18,760 --> 02:35:22,320
The project can be a little longer,
it can go overboard,

3091
02:35:22,520 --> 02:35:25,840
but still customer is satisfied,
their feedback is in there.

3092
02:35:26,040 --> 02:35:28,920
And this how basically we're

3093
02:35:30,280 --> 02:35:33,320
is there any meeting
for bringing all applications together?

3094
02:35:34,240 --> 02:35:36,480
Could you elaborate a little bit on that?

3095
02:35:36,480 --> 02:35:41,760
What do you mean by that?

3096
02:35:41,760 --> 02:35:43,040
It's actually very easy, guys.

3097
02:35:43,040 --> 02:35:49,600
When you get into the real
it's pretty simple.

3098
02:35:49,600 --> 02:35:50,360
I know.

3099
02:35:50,360 --> 02:35:51,760
I didn't understand your question.

3100
02:35:51,760 --> 02:35:54,360
If you don't mind elaborating,

3101
02:35:54,760 --> 02:35:55,920
is there a product? Yeah.

3102
02:35:55,920 --> 02:35:58,760
I mean, we had meeting
where we talk about it, but remember

3103
02:35:59,440 --> 02:36:02,280
the entire project, we can talk about it,
we break it down

3104
02:36:02,280 --> 02:36:06,480
to these small sprints
because it's impossible to.

3105
02:36:06,480 --> 02:36:09,480
Tackle
the entire project all at once, right?

3106
02:36:09,480 --> 02:36:14,000
So they break it down and that means small
sprints and I altogether.

3107
02:36:14,480 --> 02:36:17,520
Yup, exactly. So that's those agile.

3108
02:36:17,640 --> 02:36:21,720
Now this is has a lot more
a lot more involvement in here

3109
02:36:22,200 --> 02:36:24,840
overall but yeah that's it.

3110
02:36:24,840 --> 02:36:29,640
Any question is there anything you did not
understand about Agile so far

3111
02:36:30,640 --> 02:36:31,720
any confusion

3112
02:36:31,720 --> 02:36:37,560
anything.

3113
02:36:37,560 --> 02:36:38,520
No, not yet.

3114
02:36:38,520 --> 02:36:39,080
And guys

3115
02:36:39,080 --> 02:36:42,960
remember this don't feel overwhelmed
if there's a lot of terminology to this.

3116
02:36:42,960 --> 02:36:46,760
Okay, guys, in the next six months,
you will hear these words so many times

3117
02:36:47,120 --> 02:36:48,600
it will make a lot of sense to you.

3118
02:36:48,600 --> 02:36:50,640
Trust me, it is not difficult.

3119
02:36:50,640 --> 02:36:53,440
It's just a lot of terminology. Right.

3120
02:36:53,440 --> 02:36:57,160
But when you play with the JIRA board,
when you play with all of this

3121
02:36:57,160 --> 02:36:59,160
and everything,
it'll make a lot of sense to you.

3122
02:36:59,160 --> 02:37:02,800
And keep in mind you will be working on
JIRA, making user stories

3123
02:37:02,800 --> 02:37:06,600
all this things later on.

3124
02:37:06,600 --> 02:37:08,640
User story is a requirement.

3125
02:37:08,640 --> 02:37:11,960
Okay, Product backlog
is that requirement in that

3126
02:37:13,080 --> 02:37:17,240
entirety, meaning all of them combine
all accumulation of all of that.

3127
02:37:17,640 --> 02:37:19,880
So bunch of thousands
of users points. That's it

3128
02:37:23,600 --> 02:37:24,160
usually.

3129
02:37:24,160 --> 02:37:27,960
Dennis Yes, some companies have
sometimes some companies will have

3130
02:37:27,960 --> 02:37:31,040
a little bit different structure,
but you have to wait for the developer

3131
02:37:31,040 --> 02:37:35,120
to be remember this, you not just sit
in, you will still have later

3132
02:37:35,160 --> 02:37:37,880
you learn, you'll do manual test case
and then you go automation.

3133
02:37:37,880 --> 02:37:42,360
So you'll still be working.

3134
02:37:42,360 --> 02:37:43,800
Is the business on the client?

3135
02:37:43,800 --> 02:37:47,440
Yes. In this picture that I showed
you last time, that's the client, right?

3136
02:37:47,560 --> 02:37:52,800
Same example I give you HP,
also the development team and everything.

3137
02:37:52,800 --> 02:37:56,280
Client was united
supposedly over you making the product for

3138
02:37:57,320 --> 02:38:00,960
is the business owner. Yep.

3139
02:38:00,960 --> 02:38:03,560
The product owner
communicates to the business owner.

3140
02:38:03,560 --> 02:38:05,840
That means the ones you're building for.

3141
02:38:05,840 --> 02:38:10,400
This is the entire company and the team
that's hired to create that application

3142
02:38:10,400 --> 02:38:14,240
for business owner or whatever company
they're representing, for example.

3143
02:38:14,640 --> 02:38:15,840
Does it make sense?

3144
02:38:15,840 --> 02:38:18,560
All right, so guys, that was it.

3145
02:38:18,640 --> 02:38:19,800
That was Agile.

3146
02:38:19,800 --> 02:38:23,520
I know there was a lot of terminology
and if you didn't get everything,

3147
02:38:23,800 --> 02:38:24,840
no problem, guys.

3148
02:38:24,840 --> 02:38:28,320
It will stick in your brain
over time in six months, trust me.

3149
02:38:28,320 --> 02:38:29,160
Repeated.

3150
02:38:29,160 --> 02:38:33,720
And we'll go this quite a few times.

3151
02:38:33,720 --> 02:38:40,080
No questions, any questions, anything.

3152
02:38:40,080 --> 02:38:41,520
They did it all in piece sprint.

3153
02:38:41,520 --> 02:38:45,160
So this there so is there any your time
where the bring the whole software.

3154
02:38:45,520 --> 02:38:48,880
I know all of this is slowly
basically coming together

3155
02:38:49,200 --> 02:38:51,840
remember everything slowly
you think of it like this right.

3156
02:38:52,120 --> 02:38:54,800
Facebook has a new feature that comes out
next week.

3157
02:38:54,800 --> 02:38:55,200
Great.

3158
02:38:55,280 --> 02:38:56,320
You'll see that later on.

3159
02:38:56,320 --> 02:38:58,480
So slowly, all that pieces come together

3160
02:39:02,720 --> 02:39:03,320
for you.

3161
02:39:03,320 --> 02:39:03,960
What you can

3162
02:39:03,960 --> 02:39:07,200
review for coding class at the moment,
if you want to just look at

3163
02:39:07,200 --> 02:39:08,120
look at the calendar.

3164
02:39:08,120 --> 02:39:10,920
If it has,
what is Java and things that you can

3165
02:39:11,280 --> 02:39:13,920
we will give you, by the way,
the instructions for

3166
02:39:15,480 --> 02:39:18,360
the installation and things to wait
till tomorrow and Friday.

3167
02:39:18,600 --> 02:39:19,760
You can follow that

3168
02:39:19,760 --> 02:39:24,160
if Sprint is completed and review is fine
and then it goes to the production phase.

3169
02:39:24,480 --> 02:39:26,280
Yes, I'm right, it can go.

3170
02:39:26,280 --> 02:39:27,840
But remember what I said.

3171
02:39:27,840 --> 02:39:32,160
A lot of companies decided not to, let's
say every two weeks, make it live.

3172
02:39:32,200 --> 02:39:37,320
Can it technically go live 100%
after the Sprint review happens?

3173
02:39:37,320 --> 02:39:38,360
It's good to go.

3174
02:39:38,360 --> 02:39:41,000
It can go, but times they don't. Yes.

3175
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:43,920
And by the way, there's no class tomorrow
since it's your first week.

3176
02:39:44,160 --> 02:39:46,160
Review will start from next week

3177
02:39:46,160 --> 02:39:48,840
because in review classes
we doing the coding reviews

3178
02:39:49,040 --> 02:39:51,520
and that's going to come from next week
by the way guys.

3179
02:39:52,120 --> 02:39:54,560
So guys, that's all I have for today.

3180
02:39:54,560 --> 02:39:55,720
I don't have anything.

3181
02:39:55,720 --> 02:39:58,440
Again,
if any questions, please do ask. But

3182
02:39:59,760 --> 02:40:01,080
it's a simple process,

3183
02:40:01,080 --> 02:40:04,280
not too difficult, a lot of terminology,
but it's still very easy.

3184
02:40:04,280 --> 02:40:06,520
And remember, again,
if you didn't get some of it,

3185
02:40:06,880 --> 02:40:11,400
it will make a lot of sense to you
guys later on.

3186
02:40:11,400 --> 02:40:12,240
All right.

3187
02:40:12,240 --> 02:40:14,640
I will see you guys on Tuesday.

3188
02:40:15,360 --> 02:40:19,080
And on Saturday, Mischelle
will be teaching your first programing.

3189
02:40:19,080 --> 02:40:21,120
So get ready, guys. All right.

3190
02:40:22,680 --> 02:40:25,760
Thank you so much, guys,
and see you guys on Tuesday.

3191
02:40:26,080 --> 02:40:28,520
So we need to start apps for Saturday.

3192
02:40:28,520 --> 02:40:30,880
Alex Just keep an eye on the course
announcement.

3193
02:40:31,080 --> 02:40:37,000
We're going to share the video
and give you announcement in there.

3194
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:37,920
All right, guys.

3195
02:40:37,920 --> 02:40:40,080
Goodnight, everyone. Have a lovely day.

3196
02:40:40,080 --> 02:40:45,200
And any time any questions, come
just either tag me or put in support ones

3197
02:40:45,400 --> 02:40:48,080
and I'll be happy to answer
if anything comes later on, guys.

3198
02:40:48,320 --> 02:40:50,760
And by the way,
it should be all online already.

3199
02:40:50,760 --> 02:40:54,280
Or maybe in the next two or 3 minutes
I'll make the slides live over there.

3200
02:40:54,280 --> 02:40:54,840
Okay, guys.

3201
02:40:56,160 --> 02:40:56,520
All right.

3202
02:40:56,520 --> 02:40:58,960
Have a go. Going. Not take out one, guys.

3203
02:40:58,960 --> 02:41:03,680
Goodbye.

3204
02:41:03,680 --> 02:41:05,160
Yeah, guys, no class for tomorrow.

3205
02:41:05,160 --> 02:41:08,520
Someone asked already? Yep. No class.
