1
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:10,840
No, I'll agree.

2
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,320
We were not refunding.

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,840
We are recording now.

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,080
Okay.

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,240
So today

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,200
we will learn how to

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,720
write duties and how to do that. Now

8
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,400
using Java in your Java products,
in your job application,

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,840
and how you can

10
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,840
how you can integrate this
with your framework as well.

11
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,320
So if we already installed it,
there is no need for 8.7.

12
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,920
Yes, it's fine.

13
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,480
If you guys do that, we will again
be wasting 14 years like we did yesterday.

14
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,560
So let's start from here.

15
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,680
Let me call it ask you and then move on.

16
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,280
So you connect to the database.

17
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:22,400
You guys know that we need the username,
the password,

18
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,160
the database, name, the host

19
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,800
default,
and all of the information in here.

20
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,280
Are we working on Main? Yes.

21
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,120
You guys can work on May not even.

22
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,640
We had filed in the testing.

23
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,800
Here's just a demo.

24
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,120
So it will not matter.

25
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,360
Which plugin
do we need to run the project?

26
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,840
No plugins. We don't need any plugin.

27
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,040
Just create a simple maven project
and add the minus equal connector.

28
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:49,800
That's it.

29
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:57,240
It's.

30
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,680
What did I miss?

31
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,920
Or you have all almost missed.

32
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:10,720
I tell you, I've already told all.

33
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,720
So this is how we combine this information
that we need to connect

34
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,400
with the backup base
to connect from Java applications.

35
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,840
So what do we do?

36
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,400
We build something called

37
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,400
database.

38
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,000
You are this database.

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,480
You are.

40
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:40,280
It first specifies
what kind of Java API we are

41
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,000
trying to use to connect to the database.

42
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,720
We will be working with the database.

43
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,760
Then we specify the type off
to get our base,

44
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,200
then the IP address of the server

45
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,600
on which the database is located.

46
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:03,840
Then the port number
and then the database name.

47
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,240
And then we feed this information
to a method

48
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,960
and that method will give us
the connection to the database.

49
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,200
Using that connection,
we can execute the curious

50
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,440
and we can fetch the
results from the database.

51
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,600
So for example, this is

52
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,240
one of the examples
of how we can build that

53
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,920
database on it.

54
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,560
So we can try to be seen here
because we are dealing with my sequel,

55
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,760
that garbage, so Pollen
and then my sequel database, then the IP,

56
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,680
this port and then syntax data,
and then my sequel

57
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,680
and then this class, this driver
manager class.

58
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,920
It has this method get connection

59
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,360
in which we boss this database.

60
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,640
You are all that we have built in here
so that this driver manager knows

61
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,840
from which base
we are trying to create the connection.

62
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,960
We passed the username

63
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:11,080
as this document
and the password and this, this,

64
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,640
this method will return us
and object of the connection interface.

65
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,320
So the connection class that we will
stored inside the connection interface.

66
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,360
The driver manager class acts

67
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,040
as an interface
between the user and the drivers.

68
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,360
Okay.

69
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,080
It is not like the interface
that we discussed and got.

70
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,840
It keeps

71
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,920
track of the drivers that are available
and handles

72
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:41,360
establishing a connection
between database and appropriate driver.

73
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,320
So let me show you
so that it makes more sense.

74
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,760
So let's, let's do a demo

75
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,400
so we could hear the main method in here.

76
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,400
Let's be clear.

77
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,360
Three variables.

78
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,760
Look, let's call it baby.

79
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,120
You are

80
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,680
so to build this DB, you are.

81
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,920
We need this information.

82
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,720
So go to your

83
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,160
sequel workbench and then

84
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,120
open up your

85
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,800
connection.

86
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,720
So click on Edit Connection.

87
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,120
And from here we can find the hostname.

88
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,000
Yes, you should be following me.

89
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,760
Are you guys following me?

90
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,320
Yes. You should be following

91
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:55,680
again.

92
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,040
Please follow me

93
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,760
as could do my.

94
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:09,520
Enjoying your pond
or the mail for a second? Yep.

95
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,640
So you should have this dependencies back

96
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,720
and inside of that
you should have this dependency.

97
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,040
Alexey,
all of you have you added this dependency

98
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:26,720
you follow me to here?

99
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,760
Is there anyone who is having issues

100
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,760
with adding these dependencies?

101
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,000
I do not
have a job in my skill connection.

102
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,720
I also do not have at my sequel connection

103
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,920
a moment.

104
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,400
You mean on the page

105
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,680
in here

106
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,880
you can use the same information

107
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,000
that I am showing and yet it's fine.

108
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,040
I forgot how to define a string.

109
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:09,600
If then I am very,
very happy to hear that.

110
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,120
Plus, please have some clapping for

111
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:22,480
that is for this great achievement.

112
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,800
Where did you get the dependency?

113
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,040
I got the dependency from?

114
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,160
I tell him from where
I got the dependency.

115
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,360
You said he didn't miss anything.

116
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,520
We got it from the Maven.

117
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,480
Good morning. Sorry I'm late. It's fine.

118
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,000
Okay, guys,

119
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,480
let me send you this information in here
so that you guys don't get to go on.

120
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:46,840
Good work.

121
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,680
Is there anyone who has not ended
this dependency

122
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:58,880
in your project?

123
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:03,720
You are serious today.

124
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:09,160
Yesterday was a complete disaster.

125
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,280
Complete, complete, complete disaster.

126
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,560
So those are those who don't have

127
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,960
this information on your government.

128
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:24,840
You guys can use the information
from here with me.

129
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,560
So the first thing we specify, the

130
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,840
type of API that we are using.

131
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,920
So right now
we are using B did, B, b, C API, right

132
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:44,280
then A colon, and then we specify
what kind of database we are working with.

133
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,640
So which database we are working
with. DICE

134
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,760
it's my S, right,

135
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,480
so we have to specify it
without specify like this in all lowercase

136
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,160
and then we specify another colon
and often back

137
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,520
to forward slashes.

138
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,520
And then we need

139
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,000
the IP of this server on which the

140
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,400
Yes. Dennis

141
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,200
So on which this database is located.

142
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,280
So I am copying this IP.

143
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,520
Those who do not have this IP are
investing in the like questions channel.

144
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,360
You guys can copy it from here.

145
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,080
Okay,

146
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,360
so then comes the IP part, right?

147
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,680
And if we check it, then comes

148
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,800
the board of the database. So

149
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,760
IP, then column and then reports.

150
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,120
So or most probably this information

151
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,800
you guys will be getting this information
from your DB

152
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,120
so you guys don't need to worry
about on your jobs.

153
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,000
So we are using 3003

154
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,480
as the code then for Slash
and then the name of the backup.

155
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,880
So I am copying it from here

156
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,440
and let me put it in here
and when you define it.

157
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,080
So let me also send you distribution
because a lot of you

158
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,720
will be making mistakes.

159
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,040
Building this being stones
use the steepest thing.

160
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,200
I don't know,
even if I have delivered correctly or not.

161
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,480
We will see

162
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,520
this.

163
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:35,880
So again, let me repeat the type of API
call database name colon

164
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:41,400
to forward slashes the IP of the database
on the IP of the server

165
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:46,160
on which the database is located,
then column and then the port number

166
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,480
and then in forward
slash and then the name of the database.

167
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,160
So you will be getting these baby
strings from your DB is on your job.

168
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,080
So you guys don't
need to even worry about.

169
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,040
I am You have just explained it

170
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,680
so that you guys can understand
how you can even if you don't get it.

171
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,880
The next thing we will be needing
a username, right?

172
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,560
Everyone needs a username and password
to connect to a database.

173
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,800
Can you show your physical connection
server?

174
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,320
No, it is located on us

175
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,200
and I don't have the credential
as currently for that.

176
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,960
The developers are managing it for syntax.

177
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,320
They do all of this
setup thing and everything.

178
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,360
We just tell them the requirements.

179
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,600
So then we will be needing the username

180
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,120
and we also need

181
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,240
to be password.

182
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,240
So what is the username goes
to the syntax,

183
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,000
underscore extreme right

184
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,200
and and the password log syntax.

185
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,760
I tell 1 to 3. Right.

186
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,840
I am not wrong.

187
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,920
Syntax room one two, three.

188
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,240
Yes. So they make sure

189
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,280
that you are entering this information

190
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:14,080
as it is without changing it.

191
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,080
Or are you guys done

192
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,480
with these three things?

193
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,680
Now let's declare the variables
to hold the connection

194
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,440
object, the statements
and the other stuff.

195
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,400
So first I will show you how it works.

196
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,040
Then I will explain
what each object is doing.

197
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,000
So we will be needing an object

198
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:45,960
A and a variable of connection class.

199
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,560
Right now I'm initializing it with NULL.

200
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,760
Okay, then we will be needing.

201
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,040
Are you guys able to see these?

202
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:58,440
Make sure guys these are coming from Java
dot school import.

203
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,960
You are not importing
it from somewhere else

204
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,720
are you guys do do

205
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,560
you guys see this
or you are getting some kind of datas?

206
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,040
If you are getting right data, that means
the dependency that you guys have added.

207
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,320
You either have not sync your project
or you need to invalidate your

208
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,160
in your session.

209
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,000
Okay.

210
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,840
And very so we have this

211
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,320
the results sec

212
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,200
object.

213
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,720
That's better.

214
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,720
Let me put some comment in here

215
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,640
variable to hold the connection.

216
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:01,320
Remember guys before we can to anything
on the database, we need a connection.

217
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:06,400
So that connection thing
was all managed by my sequel workbench.

218
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,600
But in here
because we are writing the code now,

219
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,520
so we have to build
these steps as well on our own.

220
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,720
So this object will hold the connection

221
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:20,040
for us, for this database.

222
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,440
Yes, this results act.

223
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,760
It's a if an object that can store
be that in the form of a table

224
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,320
that you get when you gilti
something from your database.

225
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,800
So we will be getting the results
and the actual data

226
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,800
against activity from this object,
which import we use for it.

227
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,520
This is not
oh sorry, it should be redirected

228
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:52,600
with java door basket.

229
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,440
All the imports will be from Java.

230
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,200
Don't ask you if you guys want
I can send the imports as well.

231
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:03,360
Use this import space,

232
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:10,920
not this one of the.

233
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,040
And this object helps us

234
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,080
execute the execute

235
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,080
the duties on the

236
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,120
on the database.

237
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,960
And this object

238
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,520
here helps us

239
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,680
store the

240
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,840
results.

241
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,280
These three objects we will be using to

242
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,720
then you send them your phone or exemplar.

243
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,800
Yes, why not?

244
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,920
I can actually send you
my completely apple.

245
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,360
Oh, I am here to be complete pass.

246
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,040
And then

247
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,960
you just you just need this dependency.

248
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,480
Then add this dependency to your pond or

249
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,160
make sure you include a sticky

250
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,680
with username and password.

251
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,240
Serbian.

252
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,840
You are always operable laptop Alexa.

253
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,600
Make sure that if there are so many laptop

254
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,360
thefts in Ukraine, you

255
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,120
you tell your police guys
to make sure to check with this order.

256
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,040
Will be always interested

257
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,480
in powerful especially the Mac ones

258
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:47,960
they okay all look good days

259
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:54,560
Mac I search in
No no it is my new business.

260
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,440
So you are also partner with him.

261
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,080
Are you pushing the code in GitHub?

262
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,320
Am I right?

263
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,120
This code? Yes.

264
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,680
I can push it to the gate, I'm sure.

265
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,560
Why not?

266
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:17,520
So everyone use
those letters or polymorphic.

267
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,200
All right, guys.

268
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:25,440
So once we have these variables, now
we can use the driver, manager, player.

269
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,680
So it is called driver.

270
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,320
It is also from Java dot School.

271
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,280
So driver manager, dot

272
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:40,040
get connection is the method
that will take care of using this

273
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:44,080
information that we are providing in here
and giving us the connection.

274
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,720
So it takes three arguments.

275
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,280
The first is the

276
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:57,840
DB you are, the second is the

277
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,520
username

278
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,280
and the third is the Fosler.

279
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,920
And because now we are interacting

280
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,280
with the outside world
outside of the Java program.

281
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,680
So now we have to make sure
that if there are any exceptions

282
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,600
that can enter,
we are also handling those that session.

283
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,480
So I will write this strike at BLOCK
as well

284
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:28,760
to make sure that if we get any skill
exceptions, for example,

285
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,160
connection is not available,
username and password is incorrect

286
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:37,560
or we get an error,
we write some duty that has syntax error.

287
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:45,560
So this scatterplot
can handle all of those scenarios.

288
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:49,240
So we will be storing this inside
the connection object

289
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:55,160
that we here.

290
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,600
So I want you to execute this program

291
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,680
after writing this piece of work

292
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,080
and if you guys have followed me
correctly,

293
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,880
you should not be getting any errors
that mean the connection was created

294
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:25,560
successfully.

295
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:25,960
Okay.

296
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:30,120
So the next thing is
how do we write the queries

297
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,560
and we feed those queries to the database

298
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,920
so that we will do with the help
of this second object.

299
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,080
So from this connection

300
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,840
that we have got

301
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:48,280
from the database,

302
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,400
we can write, we can create,

303
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,960
we can call this method
that bears the statement.

304
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,840
So once I have this statement
from this connection,

305
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,320
I can also pull back

306
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,200
for the inside the statement variable
that we created here.

307
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,840
So statement is equal to
then action dot create statement

308
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:19,160
and now this using this variable,
we can start feeding after this.

309
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,200
So let's let me go to

310
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,560
my sequel workbench.

311
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:28,720
Look close this.

312
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,560
So let's see this simple table from

313
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:42,640
mechanism.

314
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,520
So let's see this table

315
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,360
and let's see what is security.

316
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,920
And these are the results

317
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,720
that we should get in our Java program
and we execute this activity.

318
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,240
So before we integrate the duties,

319
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,480
yes, I agree.

320
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,960
Before we

321
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,040
go to

322
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:18,120
create the you would use the

323
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,280
we need to

324
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,080
if we are getting the proper results.

325
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,760
This Lola

326
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,480
is not binding my brother's browser.

327
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,520
We are not looking for a browser.

328
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:44,280
Or why are you looking for a browser?

329
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:48,480
We lose the connection if you there slow

330
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,440
shows error browser not found

331
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,920
who shows you this at a browser.

332
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,920
Not old Stephen.

333
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,240
She's looking for Steven.

334
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,160
Olga, are you feeling okay?

335
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,800
Take a deep breaths.

336
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,360
Have some water please.

337
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,760
So Hal had that 0.5 x versus
four x squared

338
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:17,200
and nothing in between it.

339
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,880
Do you guys know
Olga is attending this boot camp?

340
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,320
Since.

341
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,920
Since the beginning.

342
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:28,200
So just changes her picture
in all the badges and she is always there.

343
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,480
Let me show you.
She was also in the back then.

344
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,040
I don't know.

345
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,280
You see Olga in here?

346
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:40,200
She just changed the profile picture
and she was all also in Batch nine.

347
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,720
Again, she just changed the picture.

348
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,280
If you are also in back, it

349
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,240
again, just a different picture.

350
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,520
She was also in by seven,

351
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,400
again, a different picture.

352
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,360
So she is attending the syntax
since Badge seven

353
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,520
and that's
why see you guys can imagine why she is

354
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:15,800
sometimes my boss Steven or other things.

355
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:19,200
Can you show your complete

356
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,520
and you see my original

357
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,440
It is your
that I am just looking for Steven

358
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,240
no suitable driver.

359
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,320
Oh I told you guys
not to use the latest word.

360
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,440
Yeah, they always have problems.

361
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,720
Now please, with all due respect

362
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,080
or downgrade to your schoolwork,
this would be better than that.

363
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,880
I told you.

364
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,000
I'm sorry. I should have done that first

365
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,880
try, please.

366
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,320
To look at what? Alexi

367
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,000
guys use this word.

368
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,200
General vascular sequence.

369
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,680
If you are getting that data,

370
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,360
then you show me your code. Yes.

371
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,760
Guys, use this.

372
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,400
This login 8.0.6 for

373
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:23,400
this is my.

374
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,720
Is there anyone else who is

375
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,240
getting the issue
like all you guys getting that

376
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,960
no suitable driver or

377
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:48,720
Alexey?

378
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,560
How can I get all mad.

379
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,760
What was the thought that podcast please.

380
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,440
It is a click on this bulb icon or press.

381
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,440
All right.

382
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,640
I thought you guys were writing
the Java code all the time.

383
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,080
Didn't you guys use
Java code in your customer framework?

384
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,640
Why are you guys forgot all those things?

385
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:13,560
It was just two weeks back, right?

386
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,720
What was the shortcut for autocomplete?

387
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,800
Come on, guys.

388
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,960
All to

389
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,800
white fields like you guys.

390
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:32,360
It's been, like, months
since you have been intelligent.

391
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:37,000
It feels weird to reconfigure after it.

392
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,880
Maybe they were blown in yesterday. Class.

393
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,640
It is all our knowledge. Yes.

394
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,320
In fact, all the.

395
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,720
All the problems in your life,
all that they are

396
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,120
because of the last class assignment that

397
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,000
both. Yes.

398
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,640
I will send you an written apology
for yesterday's class.

399
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,200
Please send me your address.

400
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:02,840
I have an error.

401
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,760
Yes, you are.

402
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,880
All in all, the batch is right.

403
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:12,120
Always wanting.

404
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,360
Are you doing it?

405
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,440
Is because you have not defined this.

406
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,040
Maybe you are all variable.

407
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,240
And the internet being

408
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,920
Nabeel,
can you scroll up and show me this?

409
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,280
Stocking lines of the arrow?

410
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:33,280
Most probably it is because of
I am watching your class for free.

411
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,880
Please then me intuitive. So here

412
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,040
it is also an ability.

413
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,400
Maybe because you are using
the latest version of

414
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,960
Driver are

415
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,480
can cannot be applied

416
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:54,000
to given types.

417
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
It is get connection
not that can driver that high.

418
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,000
It is.

419
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,840
It is that connection did not get

420
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,200
automate a lot of your mouse over

421
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,320
the border of username and password
and show me what intelligence is

422
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,440
access denied for user blah blah blah.

423
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,600
Using password

424
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,400
and you are

425
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,960
your password is not correct.

426
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,000
You have syntax at different.

427
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:57,600
Oh my God why are you guys are doing this?

428
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,720
Why it is happening?

429
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,080
I think it's just two weeks.

430
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,360
Right? You are. You are.

431
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:06,080
You have not touched Java, right?

432
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,080
Let me send you the complete code.

433
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,840
Guys, it's almost time.

434
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,840
Please, please, please do this time.

435
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,560
Please go to.

436
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:15,920
I will.

437
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,640
Even if they ask you to write a follow up.

438
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,000
I don't think so.
You guys will be able to do that

439
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:31,920
quickly.

440
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,600
Showed me all the errors.

441
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,640
If you guys are getting any errors,
some of you can post this for channel two

442
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,480
is also there.

443
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,720
Some of you can post in here
so that we don't waste much time.

444
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,800
I think there are hardly
ten lines of code.

445
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,520
Maybe

446
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,680
I should be doing this right now.

447
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:05,520
Let me know once all of you are good.

448
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:13,160
It might be a problem to as
I would get the word, the

449
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,160
okay, so

450
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,720
no, no, it's not me.

451
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,760
Please don't blame me

452
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,960
for all the problems
that you have in your life.

453
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,520
Are you already have so many problems
in my life

454
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:35,160
that I have to figure it out.

455
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,800
Geniuses make these silliest mistakes.

456
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,920
Remember yesterday
I got you all my going to be like

457
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:44,280
cannot say a single word, right? You.

458
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,720
You have written such a comment.

459
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,520
What? I can say no to you guys

460
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,200
is, guys,

461
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:57,000
please make more mistakes.

462
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,400
Becomes bold

463
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,240
black male advice.

464
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,600
If if everyone is

465
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,480
blackmailing these days.

466
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:12,960
Okay.

467
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,640
Do you read my Arab?

468
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,600
No, sir.

469
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,240
Can you please send it again?

470
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,960
I am sorry, sir.

471
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:41,240
I. It's all because of your engagement.

472
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:47,440
Yes, yes, yes.

473
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,160
All right, guys.

474
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:50,960
Everybody looks good.

475
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:57,640
Now of still issues.

476
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,720
Oh, like

477
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,720
these because of the import homework.

478
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,400
Check your line.

479
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,160
Number one, remove that and put

480
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,920
anyone else against anyone else

481
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:14,160
having issues.

482
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:17,120
We have already spent 40 minutes on this.

483
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,840
Then lines of code

484
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,200
again, maybe black anyway, because

485
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,600
I don't know, guys.

486
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:35,400
Is it because you guys feel
so stressed, so, so relieved after

487
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,560
having those discussions
with your senior there?

488
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:47,320
It's easy to get the job,
especially silver in Zimbabwe, right?

489
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,840
You guys, you left the class yesterday
after inviting those students.

490
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,120
They're

491
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,440
already back.

492
00:31:54,440 --> 00:32:01,200
Combination of everything.

493
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,840
So guys, this statement object
that we have created and we can exit.

494
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:11,280
We can say statement, not execute duty.

495
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,280
And inside the brackets
we can write our activities.

496
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,920
So if we go to

497
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,200
my skill workbench

498
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,120
and you guys don't need

499
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,480
the semicolon in here, I like this.

500
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,280
So statement dot execute.

501
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,000
I was here till one and 15

502
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:39,280
and this all this method execute query.

503
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:43,160
It will actually give us the results

504
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,480
in the form of the results like this

505
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,120
reminder.

506
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:58,120
Remember you will, you will actually
be making 300 K right silver plasma.

507
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:03,080
Give your bank account number
in the company she will be joining.

508
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,320
And then don't tell me password

509
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:15,960
of your bank account.

510
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,320
All right, guys. So it is that it

511
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,680
is an object that can contain the

512
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,240
that table

513
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,200
so we get the results in the form
of the table from and from scalability.

514
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:28,840
Right.

515
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:35,400
So we try to vacuity here and we provide
we stored the results inside this.

516
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,960
Now this results are method.

517
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:41,200
It has a similar something similar to that

518
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,680
vibrator that we learned for the

519
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,520
so it has a method reserved set dot.

520
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:56,000
Next it will keep on giving us through

521
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:59,880
until we have that
to inside this reserve set.

522
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,560
So these are dot next

523
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:08,000
and now so you guys know that
once we execute security

524
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:14,680
we get the results
in the form of columns and rows.

525
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:18,800
So as far as there are rules in the table

526
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:23,280
that that that results are not next,

527
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,520
that result
or next that method will return as true.

528
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,280
That means that loop that we have written,

529
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:34,800
it will continue working
unless and until there are rules.

530
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:40,920
But then we can also
we also need these column names.

531
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:44,120
If let's say we are interested
in this specific information.

532
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:48,880
So what we can do,
we can specify the column names in there.

533
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:52,040
So let's say, for example,
if I want to check the results

534
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:58,840
of first name, what I can do, I can see

535
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:02,600
Alexis is out and it is old Dot.

536
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,920
Get that string.

537
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:08,560
And inside here
I can specify the name of the column.

538
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,840
So for example, I can see ID

539
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,440
and now I will be getting all the IDs

540
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:21,840
from that table
that is the result of this activity.

541
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:26,600
Will Java recognize
or ignore the last and all auto generated?

542
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,480
Not no, no, no.
It will not give you that null. It is just

543
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:31,800
I don't

544
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,320
know if it is a feature
or a bug or whatever it is.

545
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,720
The editor.

546
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,120
They also don't give you
that last row as well.

547
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:42,680
It is only the great software my work

548
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:52,160
once that gives you that class
for as no. So.

549
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,320
So if you guys execute the score,

550
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,680
you should be getting all the ideas

551
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,600
from that person table.

552
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:05,560
So all the ideas, these ideas in here,
you should be getting inside

553
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,320
your Java program.

554
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,120
Do you guys checked your ideas?

555
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:13,680
It might take some time because all of you
are executing the code at the same time.

556
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,840
So can you guys tell me
how can I modified that code

557
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:22,800
to get the first
and last name and age as well?

558
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,840
It is easy or hard guys writing Java code

559
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:32,160
to get the results from
that is either easy or hard, so you

560
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,920
just need to understand these three

561
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,640
interfaces.

562
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,960
Connection statement and result.

563
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,960
So can you guys tell me
how can I get the first name?

564
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:51,080
Last name as well?

565
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:51,560
Little

566
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,720
So some space

567
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,880
and then I can again say

568
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,680
the result.

569
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,200
Dart That spring

570
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,480
and the name of the column

571
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,760
is first name, right?

572
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:17,040
So the first name like this,

573
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:26,920
is there anyone who is getting any errors?

574
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,240
So I now get the first names as well

575
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,520
and then you can obviously
modify it again.

576
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:47,560
Sorry to get the last name

577
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:59,160
and a

578
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,240
so reserved boss.

579
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:07,800
This thing, if that string is overloaded,
is it insensitive? No.

580
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,400
The same column names
you can specify in uppercase case,

581
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,320
same rules that you guys have learned

582
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:19,560
in your classes.

583
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:25,120
But as a good practice, you should always
specify the column names as it is.

584
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,680
As you see on the

585
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,680
editor's in

586
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,960
here, so that
even if some of the databases they have,

587
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:38,840
this is sensitive issue,
you guys don't waste your time

588
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,200
resolving those issues.

589
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:48,320
So do you guys see
all of this information?

590
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,360
Is there anyone who is getting any errors

591
00:38:51,360 --> 00:39:11,960
or issues?

592
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:17,040
Let me go through pretty little bit
so that you guys can also understand

593
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:25,640
these objects.

594
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:29,680
So the clear statement,
the method of connection are

595
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,440
all Andy a mod

596
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:41,000
I can not expect this out of
at this point.

597
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,320
Why you are typing skill and then column

598
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,880
is just
have you not been using intelligent

599
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,680
like this school dart dart.

600
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,800
It is a suggestion from intelligent.

601
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:06,160
You don't need to type it like this. It's

602
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,160
I don't understand
what is happening to you guys.

603
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,480
Not will.

604
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:21,120
Why are you calling result
Do not object to ASCII stream

605
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:24,520
and then passing the matter
method Just get a string method

606
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,800
that is Are you okay?

607
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:36,240
I thought it was only mean. So

608
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,320
do you need this code?

609
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:46,800
Okay.

610
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:52,040
Grade 19.

611
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:55,720
Oh, I heard that
it has effects on your brain

612
00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:00,160
as well.

613
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:08,880
Java over.

614
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,200
And let me tell you the quote.

615
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:21,000
Complete could actually be complete mean.

616
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,280
Then you throw all code in school.

617
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,880
Alex, You mean to query the query?

618
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,600
It's simple.

619
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,920
Select all from person.

620
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:32,520
That's it.

621
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:35,960
The that is all the code that I thought

622
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:44,640
I go for.

623
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,200
Are you getting better than we are?

624
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,240
Wondered about this
so we cannot not focus.

625
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,680
Okay.

626
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,720
I am sure I did.

627
00:41:53,720 --> 00:42:00,120
Good thing actually.

628
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,840
Oh yes, you guys, it can happen.

629
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,960
It's perfectly fine.

630
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,320
It's perfectly fine. So.

631
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,080
So do we move to the next step? Rise

632
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,600
Or if all looks good, should

633
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:16,560
we move to the next step?

634
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,720
Okay, so

635
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,520
there is an important thing

636
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,600
that I want to discuss in here.

637
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,440
These objects, this connection statement

638
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:34,200
and set objects,
they are actually very important objects.

639
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,400
And unless and until we close them,

640
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,000
they keep on occupying their resources

641
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,800
as far as your application is running.

642
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:48,120
So if you are building an application
that runs on a server

643
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:52,360
all the time, the resources
will all go forward all the time.

644
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:57,440
So we should close the resources
like we did for the

645
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,120
except for the file to be filed, we closed

646
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,360
the file screen.

647
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:06,480
So for that you guys know that
finally block is the place

648
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:13,160
where we should do
all of this stuff right?

649
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:18,160
Then Java Console show the structure
of table with border, for example.

650
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,920
I think you can write your

651
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,040
your source in any way you like.

652
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:29,520
I am not sure
if there is a built in method to

653
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,840
which we can just pass
this results are displayed

654
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,960
the output light
that my workbench is displaying.

655
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:41,080
You saw searching it on the internet
if it is possible,

656
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:45,440
but I have not seen such a method.

657
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,840
So in the finally block, we should

658
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:53,280
we should close these objects as well.

659
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,600
So once we are done using the results
that we should say

660
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:02,040
that result not close,

661
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,000
but because we are initializing these

662
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:10,280
variables with null values.

663
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:14,680
So they are chances
that if anything goes wrong in here.

664
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:19,280
So if you guys remember from your prior,
if your exception places,

665
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:24,480
if anything goes wrong in here,
these results will never be initialized.

666
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:28,560
The the execution will directly jump
to the catch block

667
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:32,040
And this where variable will contain null.

668
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:36,080
And what happens, guys,
when we call a method on an object

669
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,120
null pointer exception.

670
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,920
Right null pointer exception.

671
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,960
So it is a better idea.

672
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,480
Is a good practice
to check for the null values before

673
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:59,400
we call any matters

674
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:03,960
on those objects.

675
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:07,080
So if result is not equal to null,

676
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:10,080
then only we want to close this right?

677
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:10,640
Get again?

678
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:16,000
Yes. Also,
if the if we get any issues in here,

679
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:19,120
this this variable will never be
initialized properly.

680
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:22,920
This actually this complete code
will not be executed right.

681
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:28,040
And if something is not initialized,
the property of properly

682
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,680
does not make sense to close a pride

683
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:34,960
even if something is not opened,
then how can we close that?

684
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:39,000
So Eskil warned us that,
Hey guys, you should also.

685
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,960
You can also get an exception when you

686
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,600
try to close this result.

687
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:49,960
So for that
we need to add the get block again.

688
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:53,960
And remember, guys, as a best practice.

689
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,600
If a single

690
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:00,640
method is containing multiple
try catch blocks,

691
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:05,200
you should create a separate
method for back in your program.

692
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,600
So what I will do,

693
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:11,000
I will select this piece of code

694
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,800
I will right click and then refactor

695
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,880
and then extract the method.

696
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,240
Let me know
if you guys see this option and

697
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,600
select the piece of code,

698
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,120
then refactor and then expect

699
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:35,560
method.

700
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,800
Do you guys see this option

701
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:41,480
of the click on extract method

702
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:45,240
and then you can view
any name to your method.

703
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:51,000
Can I see the code behind it?

704
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:56,080
You mean above it for this one?

705
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,840
Give me on one more time this time.

706
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:00,680
So let me rename it. Oops

707
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,840
Refactor

708
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:13,880
extract method
and let's call it clause. So

709
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:18,480
these are set.

710
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:20,760
I can

711
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,440
do this guided less created
DB You do this class

712
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:27,560
because you guys can also use
these methods in your framework.

713
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:30,840
Let me put all these methods in so DB

714
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,480
utils

715
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:42,880
and let's

716
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,840
copy that method

717
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,320
from here.

718
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:56,120
So your duties
so that you can use these methods again or

719
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:05,040
and it should not be private
or should be public

720
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,560
and it is static.

721
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:10,960
So when you add the name of the class

722
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:19,440
dot proposal to this,

723
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,720
let me know once you guys have done
all of this,

724
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:51,840
I you lost me

725
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,880
since the right click

726
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:58,720
Mohammadi just create this matter.

727
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,400
The purpose of that right
click was to create a method

728
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,920
and write that code in that method

729
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,600
is the util package along with the main

730
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:12,680
I shall

731
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:19,800
do many util package along with the main.

732
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:23,320
You want to create a separate package
for this util class.

733
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,960
This is what you mean

734
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,480
and want the quality of

735
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:30,360
it is fine.

736
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:31,640
For now.

737
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:34,560
We will create those packages
in your framework actually.

738
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:35,080
Okay.

739
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:36,880
This this is just a demo.

740
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,440
We will create those packages in

741
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,520
you send the code. Yes. Issue.

742
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,160
So let me send you
the main method from here.

743
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:49,360
This and let me also send you

744
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:54,120
this W-2s class complex.

745
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:59,320
And guys, if you still feel
I am going fast, Lucas, you can stop me.

746
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:00,480
Alexi

747
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,920
But if you guys feel

748
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:06,080
that I am going faster, you can stop me.

749
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:07,920
I'm back.

750
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:10,840
Okay.

751
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:11,520
Nice.

752
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:38,400
Please take your time.

753
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:43,120
Yes, guys, please start fighting with me
to the end in place for some comments.

754
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:51,240
Nobody saying something different.

755
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:56,400
Can we write our access
that to be in configured property?

756
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,280
Yes. For one,
we will do that When I will tell you

757
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:03,360
when we will be integrating
all of these things with your framework.

758
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:09,640
We will do everything in proper places
like concrete fires,

759
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:17,160
properties, files and all that. So

760
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:26,640
adrenalized when

761
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:44,920
you are done.

762
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:46,720
Okay, so let's do this guys.

763
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,920
Let's copy this exact same code

764
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:52,720
and for the next demo

765
00:51:52,720 --> 00:52:04,640
we will modify this code.

766
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,560
So let's create another class.

767
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:09,840
Let's call it clear Demo two

768
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,080
and last space.

769
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:30,800
The code in here for

770
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:36,480
I should copy the main metadata stuff

771
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:44,760
like this. Yep.

772
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:48,840
Yep. Pasting.

773
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:51,320
And I'm closing this class, guys.

774
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:55,960
Right.

775
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:57,960
Oh, we missed one more thing.

776
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:00,480
Let's go back to demo once again.

777
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,800
So we only close to the

778
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:07,680
results set.

779
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:11,600
We also need to close the statement
and the connection.

780
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:15,640
Let me fix the error in here

781
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,560
and let's close these things

782
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:27,880
so let us to next.

783
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:34,160
Why not copy this one,
copy this method again days

784
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:39,160
and let's call it
the second thing is the statement.

785
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:40,080
So let's follow up

786
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,160
rules

787
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,320
statement

788
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:50,200
and instead of passing results, whoops,

789
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:58,960
we've instead of passing the dataset,
we will pass a statement.

790
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:03,480
And then this statement is not doing no

791
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:06,640
and statement of false

792
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:10,400
and you can again copy it to

793
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:13,320
close the connection.

794
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:17,080
You guys, if you don't want to follow me
you don't need

795
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:21,720
I will send these matters to you.

796
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,720
So connection

797
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:38,040
and connection is not important.

798
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:41,320
And so let me show you all of these

799
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,360
three matters to

800
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:51,960
Alexi lost again.

801
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:55,200
I think I need to call your wife
to make sure

802
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,360
that you are not struggling or not going

803
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:02,520
with the big giant viper

804
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,680
is holding that viper behind you

805
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:09,000
so that you can focus.

806
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:14,400
So let's say DB utils dart close

807
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:18,000
statement and looks boss.

808
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,640
This statement and

809
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,920
baby is a dog clause

810
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:32,440
so it will be close connection

811
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:40,200
the yes you say

812
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:43,280
change in default

813
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,360
close connection.

814
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:50,160
They're concerned.

815
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:53,400
It all looks good now

816
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:55,880
close connection

817
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:59,120
close statement and close to the reset

818
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,400
and just to make sure
that everything works fine

819
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:14,720
you guys again again I see your data

820
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,880
and no errors this time

821
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:18,680
and this time.

822
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:20,760
This, by the way, this is the proper way.

823
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:24,280
Nice to open a connection. Use it.

824
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,560
And as soon as you guys are done, close it

825
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:39,920
all looks good.

826
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:44,640
Ways.

827
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:48,960
Also copy
the last lines to the demo two. Yep.

828
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,640
Thank you guys.

829
00:56:50,640 --> 00:57:01,120
I should also this.

830
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:04,000
All right, so

831
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,920
the next thing is, guys in here,

832
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:10,120
we kind of have to

833
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:14,240
for the B names of the columns, right?

834
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:16,440
But we don't need to do this.

835
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:20,240
We can also actually factor
this information

836
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:25,800
from the database
that the query that we are executing,

837
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:31,200
how many columns it contains
and what are the names of those columns.

838
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:36,280
But to find out that information, I and I,

839
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:41,240
we will be needing another object
that obviously is called result metadata.

840
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,800
So let me be clear of that as well.

841
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:46,640
So it is of set metadata

842
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:50,640
is there except metadata is required. You

843
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,040
all get to

844
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:01,880
give the information about

845
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,240
table and it's there

846
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,920
to fill this resultant metadata.

847
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:11,880
It can tell us
how many queries that acuity,

848
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:19,200
how many rules that he has returned,
what are the column names

849
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:24,320
inside the acuity, what are the data types
of those columns and things like that.

850
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:28,880
So for example, what I can do,
I can say why

851
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:34,880
the are results that are, that are not

852
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:39,720
actually I will be needing affordable.

853
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:43,280
So for example, let's say
I want to find out all the column names

854
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:47,400
in that table so I can save for I,

855
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:51,000
I equal to zero and I is equal to result

856
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,840
set metadata or to get column count.

857
00:58:55,840 --> 00:59:00,200
So it will tell me the column
count of these variables

858
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:04,440
and let me put it

859
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:07,720
inside the type edge ideologically.

860
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:12,040
Say that you can get an error and now

861
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:16,840
what I can do, I can actually print out.

862
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:21,360
So I am using print
instead of print alone.

863
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:24,640
So I can say a reader

864
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:27,840
segment our that our dog.

865
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:32,520
I can say get column name
and it requires an index to be passed.

866
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:37,320
And so if I lost the index one,
it will give me the column one.

867
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:41,480
It can tell me the label,
it can tell me the catalog name.

868
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:45,360
So catalog name,
they are the kind of the company name,

869
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:47,840
the vendor name has developed outside

870
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:51,000
the class, names and things like that.

871
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,680
So most probably the things that you guys
will be using will be the column names.

872
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:59,240
Yeah, column names.

873
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:02,880
They act as like aliases so far

874
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:06,240
are part of our
our testing of the column names

875
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:08,520
will be enough

876
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:11,760
and what I can do I can pass the index.

877
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:14,400
But there is one thing that we need to

878
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:18,920
make sure that most of the time actually

879
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:20,680
appealing.

880
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:24,240
Up till now, you guys have seen that

881
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:29,000
all the things they have a starting
this index starts from zero.

882
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:33,240
But for this reason such metadata
if starts from one.

883
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:37,440
So if you start the loop from zero,
you will be getting an error.

884
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,200
So and after

885
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:47,200
putting anything out of the names,
let me just bring a new line.

886
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:49,720
So there we see the information.
Excellent.

887
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:55,440
So let's execute this.

888
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:57,720
I'm closing this class. Nice.

889
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:01,200
And so that column called

890
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:04,480
Oh, what,

891
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:07,920
you're going to initialize this video,
but we need to like this valuable asset.

892
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,400
So these are certain metadata.

893
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,880
So we will be getting this result,
certain metadata

894
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:17,640
from this.

895
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,960
Let me talk to this code. And

896
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:24,160
so we will be getting this result

897
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:29,680
from this result, not getting metadata.

898
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:34,200
So we need to call this method as well.

899
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:36,160
I will send you the code.

900
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:39,800
We just spoke last time, but

901
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:47,000
I think we should put some spaces as well

902
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,320
so that you guys can see

903
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:54,840
all the names of the columns

904
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:02,880
that we see the

905
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:07,080
I need the first name,
last name and age be and

906
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,680
but these are actually all the columns

907
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:19,080
that are in here.

908
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:21,240
Where is that?

909
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:23,360
So we are missing the last column.

910
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:26,720
We need this equal less than equal to sign
as we would like to with this time.

911
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:29,080
The index is not starting from zero.

912
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:30,840
So many good idea was missing in here.

913
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:32,080
Let's see.

914
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:35,320
Let's get that as well.

915
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:39,120
Now it looks like so I'd be first

916
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:43,800
name, last name, gender city in papers
but then when you really

917
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:48,400
and they are
the exact same column names in here

918
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:53,280
so the information that guys
we were hard coding in here

919
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:57,280
now we don't need to hide
all that information in here. Yep.

920
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:06,760
Is it good Now for one,
you'll get that there is no difference.

921
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:11,040
Let's not discuss the column level.

922
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:12,920
We will not be needing that.

923
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:17,000
But if you guys are just curious
what you guys can do.

924
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:21,000
As I have printed out these
get column names,

925
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:25,560
you can all, all the methods and can
print out different different things.

926
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:29,200
But the main purpose
why we are using this,

927
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:33,240
there are so many metrics
we will not be going over all the methods.

928
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:39,440
The main purpose of using this object
is to make sure that we don't particle

929
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:44,600
any values and if we are building
something, we can write some genetic code

930
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:47,840
that can automatically factually column

931
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:50,840
names
and corresponding data from the table.

932
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:56,760
So can you guys tell me
how can I avoid these hardcoded values?

933
01:03:57,360 --> 01:04:00,800
So I am writing a loop
to get the column names

934
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:05,200
that I am printing in here,
but how can I avoid this?

935
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:10,680
What do I need to modify inside this loop
so that all the column names

936
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:14,720
they are fashioned automatically
and the corresponding data

937
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:17,920
for all the column names
is also attached automatically.

938
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:21,560
So this texting method,
it requires the column name.

939
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:25,080
So somehow
I need to write a piece of logic

940
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,280
that can pass the column names one by one

941
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:34,080
to this string method,
and then we can get the cross

942
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:37,120
bonding that
then you guys modify this code to do this.

943
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:42,000
Have you guys underscore the problem?

944
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,160
So we want to avoid this hard coding? No,

945
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:46,640
Aleks, we

946
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:51,120
don't I don't want to specify these
these ideas.

947
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:55,440
First name, last name, because I can now
write a loop to get all of these

948
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:58,520
column names
automatically with the help of this

949
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:01,840
result of certain metadata.

950
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:04,560
So I want to modify this loop
in such a way

951
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:08,360
that I don't need to hard for these values

952
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:11,480
and I get all of these values from this.

953
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,480
My connector.

954
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:16,360
All right.

955
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:21,040
Straight through with the list.

956
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:24,200
Okay, So

957
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:24,760
check this out.

958
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:28,120
This I am copying this loop.

959
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:32,120
Okay, in here.

960
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:37,560
So in this result,
set the metadata to get column.

961
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:39,720
I gives me the column name right?

962
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:42,760
So if I copied this column name

963
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:48,640
and instead of hard calling this value,
if I passed that in here

964
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:52,440
like this,

965
01:05:52,440 --> 01:06:03,120
oops, I'm deleting this

966
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:14,520
and I am deleting Augustus,
I will change the score.

967
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:18,680
So what I am doing,
I am starting from column number one.

968
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:21,800
I am I creating through

969
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:25,000
all the columns one by one

970
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:29,120
and I get the first column name
by calling this method.

971
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:31,680
There are certain letters
that are not that column name.

972
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:32,600
Right?

973
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:38,040
Then I pass that column
name to this string method.

974
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:38,800
Right.

975
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:44,080
And once we pass the get string
a column name,

976
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:48,200
we know that it will give us the data
from corresponding row.

977
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,080
Right.

978
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:52,200
So this result not

979
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:56,120
exiting, will get the corresponding data
from that column.

980
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:56,440
Right.

981
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:59,320
And then I am printing out
that information.

982
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:02,680
So instead of oops

983
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:05,840
instead of quintillion, that's the print

984
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:10,240
and, use this space.

985
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:14,440
And after that, let's print out a new line

986
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:27,040
right there, see if we get the desired.

987
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:28,040
So you guys see

988
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:31,320
now we are

989
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:34,200
not uploading any of the column names

990
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:38,400
and we get all the data in here

991
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:44,280
from that table with columns.

992
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:47,640
Oh, let me send you this code as well,

993
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:53,000
because you guys will not be writing
this code again and again.

994
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:56,400
Once this code
has been integrated in your framework,

995
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:59,040
you will just be calling the method

996
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:02,560
and you will be getting
your desired desired result.

997
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:05,000
But you should definitely know
how this code is working.

998
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:09,600
So if you guys don't understand
any of this line, you can tell me

999
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:15,040
I can debug this code for you, but

1000
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:21,840
let me know guys,
if you don't understand any line of code.

1001
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:28,360
That line of code is doing,
you should be getting something like me,

1002
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:47,880
like this.

1003
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:48,520
Yes. Yes.

1004
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:50,080
Please ask your questions.

1005
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:52,560
Yes, ask good questions.

1006
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:55,360
And actually,
let me also put some comments for you.

1007
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:57,800
Okay.

1008
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:00,960
Getting the back obvious connection

1009
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:05,440
from driver

1010
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:11,320
manager class.

1011
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:12,840
Can you debug it quickly?

1012
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:17,240
So I was asking everyone else
other than Hallmark, is there anyone else

1013
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:20,240
who wants to be this code

1014
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:26,320
other than Anna? Yes.

1015
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:29,280
Anyone else other than of

1016
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:36,160
you guys?

1017
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:39,440
Just just let me just put the comments you
then I will debug this for you.

1018
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:43,080
Creating a statement

1019
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:48,080
to execute the

1020
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:56,040
duties,

1021
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:58,800
executing

1022
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:01,560
the duty

1023
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:10,400
or building the user or

1024
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:16,400
although I know

1025
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:18,440
you guys will never look at these comments

1026
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:29,640
Body by mission work metadata.

1027
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:32,800
Is it a big class or another something

1028
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:36,680
boss or another something

1029
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:40,320
awesome, another something?

1030
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:44,200
So let me click on this variable name.

1031
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:46,960
I am holding down my control button

1032
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:49,920
and I press on digital set metadata

1033
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:54,720
and now you guys will tell me
if it is a class or what is it?

1034
01:10:55,280 --> 01:11:00,600
What is it guys?

1035
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:02,560
Okay, I will be sent to code. Okay.

1036
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:06,440
It is an interface that contains a method

1037
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:09,600
to get column count
and you guys can read the description.

1038
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:13,120
It says Returns the number of problems
in this result set object

1039
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:17,600
because the number of column
is auto increment indicates

1040
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:22,680
the designated column is automatically
integrated is so sensitive.

1041
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:28,040
So I was saying if the column names
it should be case sensitive or not.

1042
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:28,360
Right.

1043
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:32,360
So you can call
this method is searchable is currency.

1044
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:35,360
So you guys can call all of these methods.

1045
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:37,680
You guys can read
the description from here

1046
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:40,920
and you guys can also search
on the Internet of Things.

1047
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,280
So all of these,
they are actually interfaces, connection

1048
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:48,280
statements that are set.

1049
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:50,880
And then we are calling these methods.

1050
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,040
They create the object of the classes.

1051
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:55,440
Which are you guys remember I told you

1052
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:57,760
this database

1053
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:00,040
is the heavily used polymorphism.

1054
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:03,160
These interfaces are created by Java guys

1055
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:06,880
and all of the vendors
which create the databases.

1056
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:09,360
They implement these methods
in their own way.

1057
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:13,040
So that's why they are all interfaces,
not classes.

1058
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:17,440
Do you guys understand this,
why they are all not actual classes?

1059
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:23,080
The actual classes are implemented by the
vendors who are developing the databases.

1060
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:27,920
It is again polymorphism in here,
so that's why you guys don't need to

1061
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:32,240
memorize different different method names
for different different databases.

1062
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:36,440
You will just call the exact same method
for of the database

1063
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:59,840
if that is supported with Java,

1064
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:02,720
it can be reserved

1065
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:09,560
object so that we can

1066
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:13,600
back to the

1067
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:18,240
column names and

1068
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:22,720
other info

1069
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:28,360
related to the

1070
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:42,440
printing being

1071
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:52,920
followed.

1072
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:54,720
There we

1073
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:02,800
column name it.

1074
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:04,560
It would be

1075
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:08,640
the string method to get

1076
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:12,760
to the

1077
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:16,720
content of or

1078
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:22,160
there are the new.

1079
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:25,680
Okay, now let's do this code

1080
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:34,360
and also debug this course
so that you guys can understand

1081
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:37,880
inconsistencies between

1082
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:42,440
let me place an e-book point in here

1083
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:44,680
and how can I debug decoding including

1084
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:53,000
calendars.

1085
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:56,760
I have left the debug point

1086
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:02,200
for two dogs

1087
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,280
I have nested right

1088
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:09,080
and then right click.

1089
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:11,400
Why you always not copy last.

1090
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:14,800
But it is because Alexa,

1091
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:17,000
you guys might have a different class name

1092
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:20,760
and you guys might

1093
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:23,160
face some issues
when copying and pasting before.

1094
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:26,400
So I this is what I expect from you.

1095
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:29,920
Create
any class any side that this demon matter

1096
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:33,200
and then write it

1097
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:40,440
and then debug as the application.

1098
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:44,160
So how can I go
to the next line, step over a

1099
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:50,120
step into some.

1100
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:52,920
So this
is where the connection is created.

1101
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:56,840
You see how much time Java takes
to create the connection.

1102
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:59,520
And once we have the connection,
you guys can

1103
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:03,440
get the database name

1104
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:07,880
and you can check the password from here,
the user and all that info.

1105
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:11,400
So disconnection that contains all the,
all that information.

1106
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:14,640
Then we created this statement

1107
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:18,800
and once we have this statement
object, it's also a very big object

1108
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:22,200
that contains so many properties
that we can modify

1109
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:25,600
to execute security
in many different ways.

1110
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:29,600
What exemple executing these in batches

1111
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:33,400
and all that, Then we execute the security

1112
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:36,400
and we get the results
in reserve set object.

1113
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:39,520
Certainly
if you expand the observed set object

1114
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:43,800
again, these objects,
they are very, very heavy.

1115
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:48,560
So you should always close these objects.

1116
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:52,760
I didn't heard this tactic question
for a long time.

1117
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:57,320
So can we create a static
can we call a static method inside the

1118
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:58,680
non static method based

1119
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:09,000
we cannot call affecting method
inside the non

1120
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:12,960
static method severity of please,
please, please.

1121
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:17,160
We're right that in the end
emit is also saying we cannot do that.

1122
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:21,160
Why cannot we call a static method
inside the non static?

1123
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:27,640
Why? What is wrong in that

1124
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:33,120
not good idea

1125
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:35,360
guys.

1126
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:36,440
Well what did we do?

1127
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:38,920
Well, this was a static method.

1128
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:40,480
This was a static method.

1129
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:42,440
Close riddle said we had.

1130
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:45,280
I called it.

1131
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:46,640
Okay, so it was also static.

1132
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:49,120
But even if I removed that,
I can still call it.

1133
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:53,280
I can still call it no issues.

1134
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:54,400
You guys

1135
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:56,560
okay, let's do this.

1136
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:58,560
Always try to answer in reverse.

1137
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:01,640
If you think you can
call, always say you cannot.

1138
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,440
And if you you cannot always say you can.

1139
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:14,640
Maybe that works.

1140
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:14,920
Okay.

1141
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:18,000
Yes, let's do this.

1142
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,320
Do it for interviews.

1143
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:24,480
Okay. So now we have the results.

1144
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:31,920
That object
and this object, it contains the fields.

1145
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:36,240
So filters zero to filter it,
and then it contains

1146
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:39,400
the name of the field table name user.

1147
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:42,360
We don't need to look
at the other information, but

1148
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:47,480
it can give us the column count in here
and we can write a loop.

1149
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:50,320
So when we are created the first time this

1150
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:54,000
results are metadata or that column,

1151
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,560
it will give us
the first name of the column.

1152
01:18:57,560 --> 01:19:02,680
So in the console we get this ID,
then we do the second iteration.

1153
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:04,160
It is equal to two.

1154
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:06,720
So we pass the I use equal to two in here.

1155
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:10,080
We will get the second column

1156
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:13,920
first name, then I put the third
and fourth column like this.

1157
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:20,280
So we will be getting all the columns
one by one right?

1158
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:21,640
Humanitarian order.

1159
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:25,680
Then again,
we use the same loop, exact same loop,

1160
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:29,160
but this time
instead of printing the column names,

1161
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:34,200
we are passing this column
names, names to this we are testing method

1162
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:39,720
and we know the exiting method can get rid
written as the data for that column.

1163
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:42,440
Right.
So the delta exiting and inside here

1164
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:47,680
we pass the column name.

1165
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:50,440
So we will be getting the data from

1166
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:53,120
for the first column.

1167
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:54,760
I missed the fun part.

1168
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:57,720
I guess that means

1169
01:19:57,720 --> 01:20:01,320
the question was
can we call the non static method

1170
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:05,280
inside this static method?

1171
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:06,840
So this is how this code works.

1172
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:11,280
Get the column name
and then get the data for that column

1173
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:14,520
and then get the next column name
and get the data and rule

1174
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:18,120
will continue
working for all of the columns

1175
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:21,920
and all the rows. Yes.

1176
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:25,320
Yes. With static or what?

1177
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:28,760
Are you good? Now

1178
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:32,640
you guys can also debug this code later on

1179
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:34,800
if you guys are still not comparable.

1180
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:38,760
So let's celebrate, guys,

1181
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:42,240
after the break, we will explore.

1182
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:46,000
We will write a
we will store this resource,

1183
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:50,160
these results inside a list of maps

1184
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:54,280
like as we did for the Excel files

1185
01:20:54,960 --> 01:21:00,120
so that we can post these that are easily
two different methods.

1186
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:03,200
We can use these
that are inside the framework

1187
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:05,320
and we can do other stuff
with that, right?

1188
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:10,160
Instead of just printing it out,
we will be using it to test different

1189
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:15,200
things.

1190
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:18,400
And also, guys, during the break, please

1191
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:21,800
make sure that you have a working copy
of The Cucumber Project.

1192
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:24,000
So I'm giving you a longer
break contained winners.

1193
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:29,160
But please make sure every one of you
have a working copy of Cucumber Project.

1194
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:32,680
So after the next exercise we will shift

1195
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:35,120
all of this code in your cucumber,

1196
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:40,000
then we will write some scenarios
in which we will get

1197
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:44,280
some information from different
then some information from the backend,

1198
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:49,920
and then we will compare that information
and will write test cases to verify.

1199
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:50,720
Let's save

1200
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:54,960
the same information that is stored in
and that we inserted in the event.

1201
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:59,760
And if that is stored
inside the back end of.

1202
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:03,680
And so I am giving you a lot longer break
guys please make sure your cucumber

1203
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:09,480
projects, they are all working
and if they are not working, I will.

1204
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:11,960
Okay. I will show you from scratch.

1205
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:16,920
Starting from how to clone it
from the good repository, a fresh copy of

1206
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:22,960
our base.

1207
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:26,520
Please be back by

1208
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:28,120
1150.

1209
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:38,240
Okay.

1210
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:42,240
So as you guys know about
the next previous class or an absolute

1211
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:44,680
method already,
so we will start from here.

1212
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:47,920
So absolute method

1213
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:52,560
is used to jump to a row directly.

1214
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:57,760
Let's say we want to iterate
every second row at row or before throw

1215
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:02,120
so we can write a piece of logic
in which we passed the row number

1216
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:05,640
and then it will jump
to that specific specific

1217
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:09,960
and then this

1218
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:14,120
get the input
in which we specified the column index.

1219
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:18,000
We used to return the data
of a specified column

1220
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:20,800
for which we are specifying the index.

1221
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:22,280
So what is happening in here?

1222
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:26,000
So let's say for example,
this is it or zero.

1223
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:31,680
This is one, two, three, four, five, six.

1224
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:34,480
And the these rules,
they are keep on going.

1225
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:38,240
So and we also have columns, columns,
by the way,

1226
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:43,760
they start from one column,
one, two, three, four, five.

1227
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:46,440
So if we directly want to

1228
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:51,400
jump to column number four
and row number five, it is also possible

1229
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:56,960
how we can use the get into method
to directly jump to a specific column

1230
01:23:57,360 --> 01:24:01,240
and this absolute method
to directly jump to a specific row.

1231
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:04,680
Ella Everyone, again

1232
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:08,320
out there

1233
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:12,840
and by then so in here
this into method is an overload method.

1234
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:15,720
We can pass the index
of a specific column.

1235
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:19,960
So let's say
I have eight columns in this security.

1236
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:24,800
So I can, I can say, let's say
maybe give me the data from the standard.

1237
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:29,400
All by saying one, two, three, four
by specifying integer four.

1238
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:34,000
I can also specify its name
explicitly by gender.

1239
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:46,200
So this method, this get into

1240
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:51,000
my 30,
takes this integer and add string aspect,

1241
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:55,680
and then this gets thing in
which would not it be hard coding.

1242
01:24:56,080 --> 01:25:00,080
I mean if sometimes you needed
you don't need to if you don't want to

1243
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:04,840
board, you can use this overloaded version
in which you are specifying integer.

1244
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:06,680
And if you don't,

1245
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:10,720
if you want to specify the exact column,
you can use this other method.

1246
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:14,760
So you might want to use these column
names as well so that

1247
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:16,600
your code is readable.

1248
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:21,040
Because right now alone,
if you look at your code right now,

1249
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:26,040
it is very hard to find out for
which columns you are getting the data.

1250
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:30,960
So yes, it is hard coding,
but it also makes your code more readable

1251
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:31,560
for depends

1252
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:35,440
if you are only looking with information,
maybe from one column or two columns,

1253
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:39,160
then maybe it is a good idea
to specify the column names as well.

1254
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:40,360
Otherwise What will happen?

1255
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:43,520
Let's say you check this code

1256
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:48,360
after three weeks, four weeks,
you have to execute this query.

1257
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:50,880
You have to find out
how many columns are there

1258
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:53,800
or you have to execute this code
to understand it.

1259
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:56,880
Now, when these kind of counts,

1260
01:25:56,880 --> 01:26:00,080
they become a part of a big system.

1261
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:04,520
Sometimes it is not possible
to just execute these small concepts.

1262
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:08,400
So in those scenarios we try to write

1263
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:11,960
as much as possible readable code.

1264
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:16,880
Then this gets fingered same,
and we pass the call

1265
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:21,080
and we pass the row index
and it gives us some natural

1266
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:25,080
and this gets being

1267
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:32,200
also used to the candidate
of a specified column.

1268
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:34,200
This is the exact same code

1269
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:39,160
with the slight modification
that we have written in the demo.

1270
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:45,360
So I am creating the connection, then
printing out simply connecting is created.

1271
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:47,920
Also printing out the object of connection

1272
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:51,400
that creating a statement present set

1273
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:54,680
and then print writing a loop.

1274
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:59,600
So before writing the loop,
I am doing this next next in here

1275
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:03,000
so that you can visually
also see where this it is.

1276
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,400
Our next method returns
and how the exiting.

1277
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:11,120
When we pass a specific column name,
it returns us the back for that

1278
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:15,040
and then closing the results statement
and the connection

1279
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:18,240
and also observe guys,
I am doing it in reverse.

1280
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:23,760
So you see
I open the connection object first

1281
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:28,680
just to keep the code simple

1282
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:30,320
in the later demos.

1283
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:35,160
As we do more demos,
the code will get real close to real.

1284
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:39,600
The real life,
how you would be reacting in real life.

1285
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:41,480
So you guys uploaded this.

1286
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:43,600
I open the connection first, right?

1287
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:45,600
But I close it at the last.

1288
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:46,680
Why I do that?

1289
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:48,360
Because this reader site

1290
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:52,040
is connected to this statement and
the statement is connected to connection.

1291
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:55,960
Okay, so sometimes you might get errors

1292
01:27:55,960 --> 01:27:59,400
if you don't follow this approach for us.

1293
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:02,960
Some of you get that basis
because for some of the databases,

1294
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:06,080
the results are statements
and connections.

1295
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:12,320
They are all linked together.

1296
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:15,880
This is about the metadata,
this is about the metadata.

1297
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:21,760
The metadata object
that we use to get the information

1298
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:26,160
about the names of the columns
from that results.

1299
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:27,880
And so

1300
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:29,440
there are two

1301
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:33,120
types of results that one is database
metadata.

1302
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:36,400
Let's say you want to get the information
about the database.

1303
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:40,160
What is the name of the database,
what is the version of database

1304
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:43,160
and all those info
So you can use or metadata.

1305
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:46,240
But it is very rare.

1306
01:28:46,360 --> 01:28:50,520
Almost everybody you already know what
kind of database you are interacting with.

1307
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:53,880
And then we have this reserve set metadata
that we have

1308
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:57,640
just used to avoid the hard coding values.

1309
01:28:57,640 --> 01:29:01,000
And these are some of the methods,

1310
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:05,960
these metadata from database metadata.

1311
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:10,600
So has got a driver name
which will return.

1312
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:13,320
You do driver, but

1313
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:15,760
it does not make much more sense because

1314
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:21,120
in here we are already specifying
all of this information.

1315
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:25,960
But if this information
is being passed to you as a parameter,

1316
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:29,800
you are writing a method
and this information is being passed

1317
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:33,360
in the form of three strings
like we are passing

1318
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:36,920
inside this connection,
then maybe sometimes.

1319
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:43,880
And sometimes you guys need to know the
driver name, but usually those companies

1320
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:48,080
would develop the underlying API
to interact with the specific database.

1321
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:49,800
They need these kind of information.

1322
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:52,880
The user name again, same.

1323
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:55,120
The name user name
that we used in the string

1324
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:59,320
and that we you possibly get connection
method,

1325
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:03,560
your database product name, the name of
the database and then the word game.

1326
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:07,680
So very simple
but never used in practice techniques.

1327
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:11,440
On the other hand,
this one you guys might want to use and

1328
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:14,960
you guys might also see it in
different flavors,

1329
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:18,680
especially this call column
count and column name.

1330
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:21,720
It tells you
how many columns are present in

1331
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:26,960
the query that you write,
how many columns that it is returning,

1332
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:31,840
and by passing the index, you can get
all the names of those buildings

1333
01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:35,520
and then column times
might also be helpful.

1334
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:39,400
For example, some columns contain
walked our data type, some contains

1335
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:43,440
integer
data type, some contain decimal ones. So

1336
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,800
if you are not So

1337
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:49,640
in this example,
we are getting all the data

1338
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:51,080
as being

1339
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:54,320
all the data as being.

1340
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:57,160
But you can also say

1341
01:30:57,160 --> 01:31:02,120
negative blob vector by that globe
reference asking whether you are a

1342
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:03,480
big decimal.

1343
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:06,520
So you can get the data
in different different forms

1344
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:11,120
and get in bigger get time.

1345
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:16,160
So you guys might want to check
what kind of information

1346
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:20,800
is presenting a specific column
before you do get spring or let's

1347
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:24,280
see if something contains alphabets

1348
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:27,440
and you call getting better on that
column,

1349
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:31,680
you guys will be getting an error because
you will not be able to convert it.

1350
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:34,920
And so this column type

1351
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:38,520
method, that column type will help you

1352
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:43,200
tell the data type of the column,
and then you can decide

1353
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:47,560
if you want to get it as is being integer
or decimal double or whatever.

1354
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:52,160
So it depends how you want to use that
information for the linear framework part

1355
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:57,120
in your application,
and then it will give you a table.

1356
01:31:57,120 --> 01:31:59,240
But there are many, many other matters.

1357
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:02,960
But these are for you guys will definitely

1358
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:06,360
be using.

1359
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:07,240
The second is

1360
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:10,720
the second demo is just shows

1361
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:21,360
how to get to those columns
and the count of those columns.

1362
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:23,640
And this is what we will do now.

1363
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:26,560
So once we have the results set, how

1364
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:34,680
we can store that an object
so that we can easily pass

1365
01:32:34,680 --> 01:32:39,360
that information from one method, either
method from one plus one the class.

1366
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:44,240
This is the code to do
that, let's have a demo for it. Now,

1367
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:49,360
any questions
before we start the demo for this case?

1368
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:53,520
Do you guys remember how we did this
for Excel Files?

1369
01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:57,520
We created a list of maps

1370
01:32:57,720 --> 01:33:03,560
right?

1371
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:13,280
So we will do exactly the same thing
in here as that.

1372
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:16,080
Are you guys ready to do stock up so

1373
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:18,520
far? One rule, one map.

1374
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:20,120
Yes, yes, yes.

1375
01:33:20,120 --> 01:33:25,440
You are right.

1376
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:28,080
So I am again copying this code.

1377
01:33:28,080 --> 01:33:33,360
So we will just modify this code
because the only thing that we need to do

1378
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:36,000
is instead
of printing out this information,

1379
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:56,520
we need to store it inside
a map of list of maps.

1380
01:33:56,520 --> 01:34:20,280
Again, without main method. So

1381
01:34:21,240 --> 01:34:22,360
virtual reality of that

1382
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:45,720
list of maps.

1383
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:49,120
Okay, well,
let me know where you're going with that.

1384
01:34:49,120 --> 01:34:49,720
You can

1385
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:54,480
if we're depleted after a while,

1386
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:57,840
I assure you we are getting the data
inside of the while.

1387
01:34:57,880 --> 01:35:00,960
How would you save the data
inside of that list of map

1388
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:14,120
side?

1389
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:16,680
While maybe if we declare it
inside the while.

1390
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:23,320
Hudson Every time that loop runs,
it will be reappeared again and again.

1391
01:35:23,320 --> 01:35:26,320
I am being a student at least.

1392
01:35:26,680 --> 01:35:29,320
Yep, yep, yep.

1393
01:35:30,240 --> 01:35:32,080
It's good at this.

1394
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:34,000
You responding

1395
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:36,760
well,

1396
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:42,440
so it will be an error list

1397
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:45,480
and for

1398
01:35:45,480 --> 01:35:55,360
So this is what we will do guys.

1399
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:57,600
And let me know guys,
if this is not clear.

1400
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:00,120
If you guys understand this part,
everything will be easy.

1401
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:01,880
So first I am creating a list

1402
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:12,680
and on each index of that list.

1403
01:36:12,680 --> 01:36:16,520
So this is index.

1404
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:18,120
This is one

1405
01:36:19,320 --> 01:36:24,800
two, four.

1406
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:27,640
Inside each index

1407
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:34,720
I will be having a map.

1408
01:36:34,720 --> 01:36:37,680
So the map will contain a key.

1409
01:36:38,240 --> 01:36:41,600
The key for the first row will be ID.

1410
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:45,200
So I will store this already in here
and this pool.

1411
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:51,480
So D and to go to the you gold

1412
01:36:52,800 --> 01:37:00,600
then that's where you have deleted that.

1413
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:04,200
Then I will still be plus name as the key.

1414
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:06,480
Then John

1415
01:37:06,680 --> 01:37:09,960
as the value then last name

1416
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:13,840
and then Jerry.

1417
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:16,560
Is it the bomb on me or on someone else?

1418
01:37:18,520 --> 01:37:21,920
And then I will keep on doing it
for all the columns.

1419
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:28,280
Please don't post-treatment.

1420
01:37:28,280 --> 01:37:32,160
And then for the second row again and map

1421
01:37:33,480 --> 01:37:35,280
again, I will use the same

1422
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:39,400
ID as E,

1423
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:45,680
but this time the value will be three.

1424
01:37:45,680 --> 01:37:48,000
The name first name Maddy

1425
01:37:49,160 --> 01:37:51,960
and then I will keep on doing it
for all zeros.

1426
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:53,280
Does it make sense, guys?

1427
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:56,800
This data structure, this list of maps

1428
01:37:56,800 --> 01:38:02,360
that I have created in here,

1429
01:38:02,360 --> 01:38:07,960
this is how we will use it.

1430
01:38:07,960 --> 01:38:10,920
So this list it contains,

1431
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:14,400
it is a list of maps, and each map

1432
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:17,640
will contain the data of one rule.

1433
01:38:18,440 --> 01:38:21,440
The column names will be used as keys

1434
01:38:21,960 --> 01:38:25,200
and the value of those that role will be

1435
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:28,000
used as the value of that map.

1436
01:38:29,080 --> 01:38:30,600
So it means nice.

1437
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:36,200
It means we need to have a map
for each row.

1438
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:36,480
Right.

1439
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:42,240
So this is this why loop
is I tripping through the rows, right.

1440
01:38:42,240 --> 01:38:44,880
So what I can do, I can see a map

1441
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:49,920
string and then

1442
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:53,160
string is equal to row.

1443
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:58,400
So can you guys tell me
what kind of map I should use

1444
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:05,720
if I have to store
this kind of character in

1445
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:19,120
link the hash provide
because link the hash maps,

1446
01:39:19,120 --> 01:39:23,520
they also store
the insertion order, right?

1447
01:39:24,040 --> 01:39:27,720
So that we can retain the insertion
order off rules in whichever

1448
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:31,480
order they are being returned.

1449
01:39:31,480 --> 01:39:33,840
So we we can use the link patch map.

1450
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:36,800
Okay.

1451
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:40,960
So I am removing this printout statement,
right.

1452
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:45,240
Because this time we don't need to print,
we need to store this information

1453
01:39:46,720 --> 01:39:48,360
inside

1454
01:39:48,680 --> 01:39:49,920
this map.

1455
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:52,800
So again, can you guys tell me

1456
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:56,000
from where I can get the key for this map?

1457
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,680
So roll all dot port

1458
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:01,760
and I need a key and a value.

1459
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:02,880
So which method?

1460
01:40:04,360 --> 01:40:07,120
This this method will give me the key
or this result set

1461
01:40:07,160 --> 01:40:13,360
or the exchange will give me the key.

1462
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:28,520
How can I get The key is the column name.

1463
01:40:28,520 --> 01:40:30,720
What? What does this matter? Return, guys?

1464
01:40:31,120 --> 01:40:40,200
What does this method return?

1465
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:42,560
The column names. Right.

1466
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:46,200
And I am planning to use the column names
as the key.

1467
01:40:46,200 --> 01:40:47,040
Right.

1468
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:51,600
So for Biggie, I see the there third
or get column name right.

1469
01:40:52,240 --> 01:40:54,800
And how can I get the corresponding value

1470
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:59,520
for that column?

1471
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:02,720
Which lines give me the corresponding
value for this column?

1472
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:04,960
I am passing the column name in here

1473
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:09,120
and this method, starting from here

1474
01:41:09,120 --> 01:41:12,440
till here, gives me the data

1475
01:41:12,760 --> 01:41:19,520
for that specific role.

1476
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:24,640
So once this loop will be done, once
we've done iterating through this look,

1477
01:41:25,360 --> 01:41:28,160
we will have a map in which

1478
01:41:28,640 --> 01:41:33,320
we will have eight keys, ID,
first name, last name, gender, age

1479
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:37,240
and eight values to John, Daddy
and between blah, blah, blah.

1480
01:41:37,240 --> 01:41:38,160
All right.

1481
01:41:38,360 --> 01:41:42,360
For the first time, then for the second
iteration of this y loop,

1482
01:41:43,320 --> 01:41:44,200
we will again be

1483
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:48,120
having eight keys ID,
first name again, last name, same

1484
01:41:48,240 --> 01:41:52,440
button values will be this time
three Matic in F 22.

1485
01:41:53,880 --> 01:41:57,480
So then we inserting that in here

1486
01:41:57,760 --> 01:41:59,800
and once we have created that map,

1487
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:05,160
then we can insert that map inside this

1488
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:07,840
next.

1489
01:42:09,080 --> 01:42:11,040
So all

1490
01:42:12,440 --> 01:42:15,120
and after we are done with this loop,

1491
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:19,520
I can in here to print out this table
like this

1492
01:42:20,840 --> 01:42:23,560
looks like this for

1493
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:31,360
so you guys see,

1494
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:35,000
please explain line 39

1495
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:38,160
one more time, which is like

1496
01:42:38,160 --> 01:42:40,560
this one.

1497
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:43,320
So to store the values in a map,

1498
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:47,560
what do we need
to store the values in the map?

1499
01:42:47,560 --> 01:42:52,800
What do we need?

1500
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:57,000
A key and a value And what we have,

1501
01:42:57,080 --> 01:43:00,360
what we are using as keys

1502
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:07,280
column names.

1503
01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:08,120
Right.

1504
01:43:08,160 --> 01:43:11,120
This method result set the metadata.

1505
01:43:11,160 --> 01:43:15,160
The column name gives me the column names.

1506
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:17,400
Okay, this is the desired set object.

1507
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:21,840
I passed the index,
so for the first operation

1508
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:28,520
the index will be one and at the column
at index number one is it this one?

1509
01:43:29,560 --> 01:43:30,400
The column at

1510
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:34,400
index number two is first name, last name
three, four, five.

1511
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:35,520
Like this.

1512
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:39,080
So this five for this inner for loop.

1513
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:43,640
When I will be one,
I will be getting ID and I will be two.

1514
01:43:43,640 --> 01:43:46,560
I will be getting first
name and I will be three.

1515
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:49,680
I will be getting last name
already will be four getting eight

1516
01:43:49,680 --> 01:43:52,400
and I will keep on getting all the column
names.

1517
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:55,320
The last in priority

1518
01:43:55,320 --> 01:43:59,760
and then to get the value for this idea

1519
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:03,720
for first row.

1520
01:44:03,720 --> 01:44:06,600
So let's say I want to get

1521
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:13,680
this first value from the row number one.

1522
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:20,400
So this rule number one,
when the Y loop is on the first iteration.

1523
01:44:21,240 --> 01:44:24,360
And this I is also one.

1524
01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:27,680
This method will give me ID,

1525
01:44:29,360 --> 01:44:32,160
this method will give me two.

1526
01:44:32,160 --> 01:44:36,440
So I pass the column, name
the information about.

1527
01:44:36,440 --> 01:44:41,720
The row is coming from this result
because you remember next method all all

1528
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:46,920
automatically moves you to the next row
after each time you call method.

1529
01:44:47,640 --> 01:44:50,880
So it automatically you
it is moving you to one row

1530
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:54,640
in advance or one by one
when this loop executes.

1531
01:44:55,120 --> 01:44:57,640
Let me actually debug this code names,
but find

1532
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,920
so right now the value

1533
01:45:08,240 --> 01:45:10,440
right now the value of I is one

1534
01:45:11,440 --> 01:45:13,600
and right now we are on raw number zero,

1535
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:16,480
which means we are
on the first creation of value.

1536
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:21,320
So if check what we get from this method

1537
01:45:22,280 --> 01:45:24,640
by creating a watch.

1538
01:45:24,640 --> 01:45:27,280
So you see it gives us an ID

1539
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:31,920
for the first iteration of
this fun book and this method

1540
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:34,920
that spring on other.

1541
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:38,640
It gives us the data for back.

1542
01:45:38,640 --> 01:45:41,160
So see, we get to

1543
01:45:41,160 --> 01:45:43,440
when we are on the second iteration.

1544
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:46,680
Now the value of I is two and now

1545
01:45:46,680 --> 01:45:50,000
we get as a key first name and as a value.

1546
01:45:50,040 --> 01:45:54,200
John When we are on third,
we get last name Daddy,

1547
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:58,480
then we get gender and

1548
01:45:58,480 --> 01:46:01,560
so we are moving from left side
to right side.

1549
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:04,160
So first we go row by row.

1550
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:08,560
Once we are on the first row,
we start from left column and its value.

1551
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:11,200
We pick that column name that is value.

1552
01:46:11,200 --> 01:46:13,400
Then next, next, next, next.

1553
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:16,160
Then we move to the next row
starting from left.

1554
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:19,200
Pick the column story that is a key

1555
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:22,200
value added as a and key value.

1556
01:46:22,680 --> 01:46:26,760
So we keep on going, iterating,
as I forgot.

1557
01:46:26,760 --> 01:46:27,440
Never mind.

1558
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:32,520
Everyone fell down asleep already.

1559
01:46:32,520 --> 01:46:41,680
Guys, please also tell me if you guys are
sleeping so that I can also go to sleep.

1560
01:46:41,680 --> 01:46:43,920
Okay. Let's go to sleep together.

1561
01:46:44,280 --> 01:46:48,440
I remember my teachers
that they used to do this with us when.

1562
01:46:48,440 --> 01:46:50,640
We used to starting in

1563
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:53,600
very, very

1564
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:57,120
junior grades, Prep, Katie
or whatever they call it.

1565
01:46:57,720 --> 01:47:01,560
So they they used to tell us,
okay, let's go to sleep altogether.

1566
01:47:01,560 --> 01:47:03,000
It's called class.

1567
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:06,200
And my teachers told me

1568
01:47:07,240 --> 01:47:09,760
listening
and understanding is very difficult.

1569
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:15,120
Yes, yes, yes, it is very difficult.

1570
01:47:15,120 --> 01:47:19,480
So already sleeping for the last one,

1571
01:47:21,360 --> 01:47:25,000
all guys, these messages,
they are very, very motivated.

1572
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:34,680
I am very motivated to show you the next
things that I want to show you to go.

1573
01:47:34,680 --> 01:47:40,680
You are also reading words wrong.

1574
01:47:40,680 --> 01:47:42,360
Okay, English master.

1575
01:47:42,360 --> 01:47:44,400
Sorry for that.

1576
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:47,160
So this is how the school is working.

1577
01:47:47,240 --> 01:47:53,640
Is not.

1578
01:47:53,640 --> 01:47:56,720
Otherwise let's open up
your cucumber frame books.

1579
01:47:57,640 --> 01:47:58,680
Okay, let's do something.

1580
01:47:58,680 --> 01:47:59,400
Let's

1581
01:48:00,240 --> 01:48:03,000
have that practice so that you, based on

1582
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:11,120
philosophy,
can you please turn this score?

1583
01:48:11,440 --> 01:48:15,960
Is it okay, guys, if I push this code,
then you guys rejected from the GitHub

1584
01:48:20,600 --> 01:48:26,440
that I have shared the repository
link in the course announcement.

1585
01:48:26,440 --> 01:48:30,200
Please use that to launch

1586
01:48:30,240 --> 01:48:39,360
or get the updates.

1587
01:48:39,360 --> 01:48:43,120
Okay, so now let's integrate
all of this knowledge in your framework

1588
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:47,640
and I want every one of you
for it to follow me.

1589
01:48:48,600 --> 01:48:50,480
So go to YouTube.

1590
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:52,840
If you have already a working copy of

1591
01:48:53,960 --> 01:48:57,360
Cucumber Framework,
you guys don't need to do these steps,

1592
01:48:57,360 --> 01:49:00,120
but if you want to do everything
from scratch,

1593
01:49:00,720 --> 01:49:04,560
you guys might want to follow me.

1594
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:07,200
So. Well,
what was the name of your cucumber

1595
01:49:08,520 --> 01:49:08,840
then?

1596
01:49:09,040 --> 01:49:10,960
This is a
this is the framework that you develop.

1597
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:13,120
Cucumber framework batch, right

1598
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:27,720
to the click on this core button
and then click on

1599
01:49:27,880 --> 01:49:30,360
copy the you are in for this

1600
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:34,200
repository

1601
01:49:35,440 --> 01:49:39,960
and you go to your intelligent
and go to file

1602
01:49:40,360 --> 01:49:45,200
new project from login control and paste.

1603
01:49:45,200 --> 01:49:55,840
Let me know once
you guys have followed me to this point.

1604
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:59,280
Is there anyone who follows the S.

1605
01:49:59,960 --> 01:50:01,880
S seeds of Samson

1606
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:06,720
or who is interested in buying the S 22

1607
01:50:09,640 --> 01:50:10,200
logo?

1608
01:50:10,200 --> 01:50:12,960
Do you see any updates? Like

1609
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:18,240
do you think that it is work to upgrade
this time?

1610
01:50:18,240 --> 01:50:24,640
I don't see much changes this time.

1611
01:50:24,640 --> 01:50:29,680
You have already ordered it
open is the best.

1612
01:50:29,680 --> 01:50:31,120
I don't know.

1613
01:50:31,280 --> 01:50:32,600
I got the new pixel.

1614
01:50:32,600 --> 01:50:37,080
Actually, I like the pixel devices
more than iPhone or Samsung

1615
01:50:37,200 --> 01:50:40,160
because they are cheaper
and their software

1616
01:50:40,160 --> 01:50:42,280
is all optimized. So.

1617
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:45,640
So well.

1618
01:50:46,640 --> 01:50:48,960
New Galaxy looks awesome.

1619
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:51,720
I preorder Samsung Country two for silver.

1620
01:50:51,720 --> 01:50:55,120
Not like you see poor husbands of.

1621
01:50:55,560 --> 01:50:58,360
Are you using Nokia 33 110

1622
01:50:58,400 --> 01:51:01,680
demo for yourself and

1623
01:51:01,680 --> 01:51:07,080
new s 22 ultra for your wife

1624
01:51:09,720 --> 01:51:12,960
Z My you are not alone, believe me.

1625
01:51:13,080 --> 01:51:16,440
I will also be ordering iPhone 13

1626
01:51:16,440 --> 01:51:20,240
for my future
wife and I still use this s 20

1627
01:51:25,080 --> 01:51:25,680
you have note

1628
01:51:25,680 --> 01:51:28,560
20 ultra at
least you have something better than me.

1629
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:32,320
Still something better than me.

1630
01:51:32,320 --> 01:51:35,440
Somehow it is on the

1631
01:51:35,600 --> 01:51:38,160
spintex re possibly

1632
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:40,800
right

1633
01:51:42,600 --> 01:51:46,280
guys, let me know once you are here

1634
01:51:46,480 --> 01:51:48,480
better once again.

1635
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:50,080
How did you go to this page?

1636
01:51:50,080 --> 01:51:54,560
I did file new and then project

1637
01:51:54,560 --> 01:52:01,720
from Login control.

1638
01:52:01,720 --> 01:52:03,200
Are we using this?

1639
01:52:03,200 --> 01:52:09,000
We have address C or not.

1640
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:15,800
This is not your framework
to convert framework. Yes.

1641
01:52:15,800 --> 01:52:20,960
You guys can rename the directories.

1642
01:52:20,960 --> 01:52:23,960
You guys created two frameworks.

1643
01:52:23,960 --> 01:52:26,840
I mean, the framework that

1644
01:52:27,160 --> 01:52:33,480
that Sunil showed you,
that is our normal framework with Sohail.

1645
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:36,280
And then you guys created something else.

1646
01:52:37,600 --> 01:52:38,760
It's the same.

1647
01:52:38,760 --> 01:52:40,200
Okay, guys, it's fine.

1648
01:52:40,200 --> 01:52:42,440
We can use this one. It's fine, it's fine.

1649
01:52:43,480 --> 01:52:48,520
You can use whatever
whichever framework you want to use.

1650
01:52:48,520 --> 01:52:50,720
Okay,
Let me know Once you guys are on this page

1651
01:52:55,320 --> 01:52:58,560
Now, I have started understanding slowly.

1652
01:52:59,160 --> 01:53:01,080
Have you guys noticed this?

1653
01:53:01,080 --> 01:53:03,480
Females,
they don't get harder text, right?

1654
01:53:03,480 --> 01:53:05,560
It's always the males.

1655
01:53:05,560 --> 01:53:07,920
No. Now I understand all the tension.

1656
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:11,080
Pressure goes to men. Women.

1657
01:53:11,080 --> 01:53:12,160
They are attention free.

1658
01:53:12,160 --> 01:53:15,280
You always.

1659
01:53:15,280 --> 01:53:19,200
I have literally not seen anybody
in my circle like women.

1660
01:53:19,200 --> 01:53:23,320
They are still all the time
living for 100 to 110 years.

1661
01:53:23,320 --> 01:53:26,560
Men, poor men,
they are almost done with their life

1662
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:33,920
after 65 years.

1663
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:37,240
So that's why we women

1664
01:53:37,240 --> 01:53:45,960
don't die.

1665
01:53:45,960 --> 01:53:50,720
Women have cardiac arrest and just to die.

1666
01:53:50,720 --> 01:53:53,280
No, no, they don't die even after.

1667
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:57,480
No, because women have multi-task

1668
01:53:57,480 --> 01:54:04,480
and men only have one task.

1669
01:54:04,480 --> 01:54:06,840
No, this is also not within.

1670
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:09,600
I can now understand
what is the true reason

1671
01:54:11,880 --> 01:54:14,760
this.

1672
01:54:14,760 --> 01:54:18,040
It's I think also women. They are kind of

1673
01:54:19,360 --> 01:54:19,800
they just

1674
01:54:19,800 --> 01:54:25,000
cry and they their heart is kind of
not that that they remove their burden

1675
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:29,200
by crying or just cussing or whatever
they are doing.

1676
01:54:29,200 --> 01:54:30,840
But men, they usually don't cry.

1677
01:54:30,840 --> 01:54:33,680
They give all of their pain inside

1678
01:54:33,960 --> 01:54:37,040
and just wait.

1679
01:54:37,040 --> 01:54:41,800
Okay, enough.

1680
01:54:41,800 --> 01:54:50,360
So like click on Clone guys,
should we clone same Yes guys

1681
01:54:50,680 --> 01:54:52,960
Deacon put on

1682
01:54:57,360 --> 01:54:59,880
and then you can click on Trust Project

1683
01:55:02,760 --> 01:55:04,920
and then New window

1684
01:55:21,600 --> 01:55:24,200
give it give it some time guys

1685
01:55:24,200 --> 01:55:26,600
let them sink from the year. Come

1686
01:55:34,160 --> 01:55:40,360
it might take some time.

1687
01:55:40,360 --> 01:55:42,600
Also guys

1688
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:45,480
I think you will get an error

1689
01:55:45,960 --> 01:55:50,320
if you are using the maven and five
so next year

1690
01:55:51,200 --> 01:55:53,960
come on next year and for

1691
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,720
this is not order

1692
01:56:00,720 --> 01:56:04,200
to be project
that how you have grown you have

1693
01:56:07,200 --> 01:56:07,720
so let's

1694
01:56:07,720 --> 01:56:11,600
use them forward in here
and there's a consent project

1695
01:56:16,920 --> 01:56:18,520
and make sure that you are not

1696
01:56:18,520 --> 01:56:21,880
getting any errors
after thinking you should see

1697
01:56:22,920 --> 01:56:26,760
all the all of your pages, runners

1698
01:56:26,800 --> 01:56:29,160
and everything

1699
01:56:34,960 --> 01:56:39,120
as we should teach you how to use cucumber
frame loops please.

1700
01:56:39,120 --> 01:56:40,160
Then this.

1701
01:56:40,240 --> 01:56:43,880
I will be privileged to be out by you
guys.

1702
01:56:44,680 --> 01:56:45,800
My own findings. Fine.

1703
01:56:45,800 --> 01:56:49,960
Maybe I am using a different version
of Java and intelligent

1704
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:51,600
it is.

1705
01:56:51,600 --> 01:56:54,080
If you are not getting any errors,
it is fine.

1706
01:56:54,080 --> 01:56:57,320
But I think it is good to use them for

1707
01:56:57,320 --> 01:57:01,960
because I guess after two weeks
I will teach you Jenkins

1708
01:57:01,960 --> 01:57:04,920
and it will definitely not like

1709
01:57:06,280 --> 01:57:08,440
with Jenkins. So it depends on you.

1710
01:57:08,440 --> 01:57:13,440
If you want to change now or later.

1711
01:57:13,440 --> 01:57:13,720
Okay.

1712
01:57:15,040 --> 01:57:16,080
Yes. We

1713
01:57:16,080 --> 01:57:19,080
need to install my sequel dog in here.

1714
01:57:19,080 --> 01:57:21,640
We need to use texture.

1715
01:57:21,640 --> 01:57:23,440
So guys.

1716
01:57:24,040 --> 01:57:26,200
So Dennis, can you please tell me

1717
01:57:26,720 --> 01:57:29,480
what is this cucumber thing

1718
01:57:29,640 --> 01:57:30,760
I want to add?

1719
01:57:30,760 --> 01:57:34,600
The the dependency for the my sequel.

1720
01:57:34,600 --> 01:57:37,280
So again, let's go in here

1721
01:57:38,320 --> 01:57:42,080
and let's use this 8.6

1722
01:57:43,440 --> 01:57:47,520
16 this time.

1723
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:49,360
Okay? Thank you, sir.

1724
01:57:49,360 --> 01:57:51,240
Dennis Sir.

1725
01:57:51,520 --> 01:57:54,000
So I am adding the dependency first thing

1726
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:57,600
because I will be working with the skills,
so I need that dependency.

1727
01:57:58,760 --> 01:58:02,720
So I am adding it inside
the dependencies tab in here

1728
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:06,480
and after I add

1729
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:09,880
the dependency,
I need to reload my project.

1730
01:58:10,160 --> 01:58:14,520
So make sure you are not

1731
01:58:14,520 --> 01:58:18,600
getting any of lines over here
and everything is up to date

1732
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:48,840
and so

1733
01:58:50,920 --> 01:58:53,440
now let's run

1734
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:57,760
any of the tests,
any of the runners just to make sure

1735
01:58:57,760 --> 01:59:02,720
that we have imported everything correctly
and our frame load looks good. So

1736
01:59:04,600 --> 01:59:07,600
I am running the smoke, but
I know you guys can run any of the runner

1737
01:59:07,760 --> 01:59:09,560
that can run.

1738
01:59:09,560 --> 01:59:12,280
So that we know everything is good.

1739
01:59:12,280 --> 01:59:23,920
Before we start modifying this project.

1740
01:59:23,920 --> 01:59:26,360
Run structured successfully,

1741
01:59:27,600 --> 01:59:29,840
I mean, blah blah blah.

1742
01:59:31,080 --> 01:59:34,640
I can get this error

1743
01:59:35,320 --> 01:59:38,400
so far plugin and for not found

1744
01:59:38,520 --> 01:59:41,520
you can use them
five and four is not working for you.

1745
01:59:41,800 --> 01:59:47,880
Mohammad.

1746
01:59:47,880 --> 01:59:51,080
Okay, so everything looks good.

1747
01:59:51,360 --> 01:59:54,160
Now we can start making changes in here.

1748
01:59:55,080 --> 01:59:57,320
You guys can use them
five and four and five.

1749
01:59:57,320 --> 02:00:03,240
Anyone will work for this
for today's class.

1750
02:00:03,240 --> 02:00:05,520
Is there anyone else
with getting any errors

1751
02:00:13,400 --> 02:00:23,640
on word?

1752
02:00:23,640 --> 02:00:26,640
So, guys, this is my requirement.

1753
02:00:26,640 --> 02:00:32,520
So what I want to do,
I want to go to this website, this

1754
02:00:34,320 --> 02:00:36,680
great extremist website.

1755
02:00:36,960 --> 02:00:40,560
I want to log in in here,
click on the log in button

1756
02:00:43,440 --> 02:00:44,760
and then

1757
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:49,920
see sort of token validation filter.

1758
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:52,800
This is not what I want.

1759
02:00:53,080 --> 02:00:55,800
After that, I want to go to be

1760
02:00:55,840 --> 02:01:01,080
am then an employee.

1761
02:01:01,080 --> 02:01:03,320
Then I want to add some information

1762
02:01:07,240 --> 02:01:08,680
in here.

1763
02:01:09,320 --> 02:01:21,760
I want to click on Save.

1764
02:01:21,760 --> 02:01:28,440
I do exist, but

1765
02:01:38,160 --> 02:01:44,240
so then what I want I want to copy this,

1766
02:01:44,640 --> 02:01:48,560
employ it from here,

1767
02:01:48,560 --> 02:01:51,760
and then I want to write a piece of code

1768
02:01:51,760 --> 02:01:54,720
that goes inside the A database

1769
02:02:00,280 --> 02:02:01,600
and it queries

1770
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:05,640
the same information with the help of that
really

1771
02:02:06,680 --> 02:02:08,880
that we see in the front end

1772
02:02:32,040 --> 02:02:33,400
is called employ it.

1773
02:02:33,400 --> 02:02:36,640
So we're

1774
02:02:37,960 --> 02:02:40,400
in for

1775
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:46,560
really important tool in this.

1776
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:52,120
So I want to make this query in my best.

1777
02:02:53,120 --> 02:02:56,680
Then I want to fetch this information
from the backend

1778
02:02:57,840 --> 02:03:01,480
and I want to factor this information
from the front end

1779
02:03:02,360 --> 02:03:04,760
and then I want to match

1780
02:03:04,760 --> 02:03:08,080
this piece of information
if it is correct or not.

1781
02:03:08,880 --> 02:03:13,800
So what I will do, I will write peculiar
to fetch this information from the columns

1782
02:03:13,800 --> 02:03:17,520
and using this query,
using this simple already.

1783
02:03:18,240 --> 02:03:22,840
I should be getting the same results
and the data should support

1784
02:03:22,840 --> 02:03:28,000
inside of these proper columns like this
should not happen that maybe

1785
02:03:28,760 --> 02:03:32,880
this door is being stored in the middle
name or the last name column.

1786
02:03:32,880 --> 02:03:33,240
Right.

1787
02:03:33,240 --> 02:03:37,000
It should be stored in the first name,
middle name and last name columns

1788
02:03:37,400 --> 02:03:39,120
inside the database.

1789
02:03:39,120 --> 02:03:43,160
So this is how you can verify different
than the backend, all the requirements,

1790
02:03:43,160 --> 02:03:49,280
clear days.

1791
02:03:49,280 --> 02:03:53,920
So as you guys know,
I don't know anything about cucumber.

1792
02:03:53,920 --> 02:03:57,560
So you guys will tell me
how can I do that?

1793
02:03:57,560 --> 02:04:04,760
So from where should I start?

1794
02:04:04,760 --> 02:04:05,640
And I hope

1795
02:04:06,680 --> 02:04:08,240
because we have

1796
02:04:08,240 --> 02:04:12,560
around tonight
90 intelligent students in here,

1797
02:04:12,600 --> 02:04:17,480
I hope we will be able to do it
next to the US.

1798
02:04:17,480 --> 02:04:18,360
No, you can do it.

1799
02:04:18,360 --> 02:04:22,360
Believe in yourself. It's

1800
02:04:24,320 --> 02:04:33,640
a go.

1801
02:04:33,640 --> 02:04:37,600
This functionality belongs to the ADD

1802
02:04:37,600 --> 02:04:43,280
employee feature, right?

1803
02:04:43,280 --> 02:04:44,640
So what do you guys think?

1804
02:04:44,640 --> 02:04:50,440
So should I write this scenario in here
or maybe inside dashboard in place

1805
02:04:50,720 --> 02:04:52,320
or blogging feature

1806
02:04:54,760 --> 02:04:55,600
there?

1807
02:04:56,120 --> 02:04:59,040
So to write a scenario,

1808
02:04:59,040 --> 02:05:01,280
we use the tags

1809
02:05:01,280 --> 02:05:04,440
and you guys tell me, what are these?

1810
02:05:04,440 --> 02:05:10,240
What is this excel that are table
simple number scenario.

1811
02:05:10,240 --> 02:05:13,240
So I am using this DB

1812
02:05:13,240 --> 02:05:16,800
tag in here.

1813
02:05:16,800 --> 02:05:21,520
So let's say
if I want to run a specific test case,

1814
02:05:21,960 --> 02:05:25,120
I can use this best tag in my runner

1815
02:05:25,640 --> 02:05:29,280
to maybe only execute that tag,
or if I have used that tag

1816
02:05:29,280 --> 02:05:32,960
with multiple scenarios,
all those scenarios will be executed.

1817
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:33,320
Right?

1818
02:05:33,320 --> 02:05:36,560
And just a way of
categorizing your test cases.

1819
02:05:38,160 --> 02:05:41,400
So after the tag,

1820
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:45,560
I will see a scenario

1821
02:05:46,600 --> 02:05:50,000
and let's call it

1822
02:05:52,520 --> 02:05:54,760
front and and

1823
02:05:55,920 --> 02:06:02,280
back and testing right.

1824
02:06:02,280 --> 02:06:08,160
And have you guys already done
some of the steps there?

1825
02:06:08,320 --> 02:06:12,560
So I have shown you the requirements
do you guys already have steps

1826
02:06:12,560 --> 02:06:16,480
for some of the requirements
I should write all it

1827
02:06:16,560 --> 02:06:18,760
to from scratch

1828
02:06:20,280 --> 02:06:21,440
we have.

1829
02:06:22,600 --> 02:06:30,280
So where do you guys have this?

1830
02:06:30,280 --> 02:06:32,640
I think I can use this one right.

1831
02:06:32,640 --> 02:06:35,880
Adding
one employee using to convert to user

1832
02:06:36,040 --> 02:06:43,080
does not have to be expensive,
but I need to successfully.

1833
02:06:43,080 --> 02:06:46,640
But I think we can use this one.

1834
02:06:46,680 --> 02:06:50,120
Right. Right.

1835
02:06:50,120 --> 02:06:52,520
Even if we are only planning
to add the backup.

1836
02:06:53,840 --> 02:06:58,200
So I will just copy these steps in here

1837
02:07:00,160 --> 02:07:04,960
and I will say
add user and third detect. So

1838
02:07:05,920 --> 02:07:08,880
it already include this step.

1839
02:07:08,880 --> 02:07:13,240
Like for example,
it will already log in inside

1840
02:07:13,240 --> 02:07:15,320
the web page, right?

1841
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:20,760
This step.

1842
02:07:20,760 --> 02:07:21,600
All right.

1843
02:07:21,600 --> 02:07:24,360
And then after I have entered of the data,

1844
02:07:25,480 --> 02:07:29,440
before I click on Save Button,
I need to capture that I be right.

1845
02:07:29,680 --> 02:07:32,040
So before I can

1846
02:07:32,760 --> 02:07:36,640
save and close this,
I need to get this employ ID in here.

1847
02:07:36,640 --> 02:07:39,840
Right?
I don't want to get employed number.

1848
02:07:39,840 --> 02:07:42,560
I want to get employee ID so

1849
02:07:44,320 --> 02:07:48,160
let's do this after this

1850
02:07:49,280 --> 02:07:53,080
and then there

1851
02:07:53,120 --> 02:07:56,640
the employee I.D..

1852
02:07:57,720 --> 02:07:58,120
Well, why?

1853
02:07:58,120 --> 02:08:01,120
It is highlighted in different color
guys. Why?

1854
02:08:01,120 --> 02:08:07,320
Why intelligent highlighting it
in a different color.

1855
02:08:07,320 --> 02:08:09,720
It means that in this scenario,

1856
02:08:10,520 --> 02:08:13,400
this step is not implemented.

1857
02:08:13,400 --> 02:08:15,720
Right. We need to implement this.

1858
02:08:16,520 --> 02:08:18,760
So once we have captured the employer

1859
02:08:18,760 --> 02:08:21,520
I.D., user clicks on the save button.

1860
02:08:22,040 --> 02:08:24,560
So must be data has been stored

1861
02:08:25,560 --> 02:08:27,000
from the front end.

1862
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:30,040
The next step should be that

1863
02:08:30,600 --> 02:08:35,440
using this employer I.D.,
we vetted this same information

1864
02:08:35,440 --> 02:08:41,400
from the database right.

1865
02:08:41,400 --> 02:08:43,360
So user clicks on save button.

1866
02:08:43,360 --> 02:08:46,800
And after that, we have

1867
02:08:46,920 --> 02:08:50,000
to employ it successfully.

1868
02:08:51,600 --> 02:08:54,640
So do we change the name,
last name or not?

1869
02:08:55,440 --> 02:08:56,840
Should we change the name?

1870
02:08:56,840 --> 02:08:59,840
Last name or not, we are hosting.

1871
02:08:59,840 --> 02:09:03,080
Can you tell me the line number

1872
02:09:10,480 --> 02:09:12,160
48 in here?

1873
02:09:12,160 --> 02:09:14,280
No, Governor, depends on you.

1874
02:09:14,760 --> 02:09:18,320
Can we insert multiple same first names

1875
02:09:19,120 --> 02:09:23,520
in your grade at premise web application?

1876
02:09:24,240 --> 02:09:27,280
If we can, we can keep them other way.

1877
02:09:27,280 --> 02:09:31,840
You can also can you if you if you guys
want to insert something different.

1878
02:09:32,840 --> 02:09:35,880
Yes. You guys can
maybe can you to Stephen and then thing

1879
02:09:36,600 --> 02:09:40,520
and in between
we can have all that here center

1880
02:09:56,360 --> 02:09:58,760
true love triangle

1881
02:10:04,440 --> 02:10:07,440
so and the

1882
02:10:07,640 --> 02:10:11,960
user enters this information
and we capture the employee I.D.

1883
02:10:12,200 --> 02:10:15,760
then we click on same button, employed it
successfully.

1884
02:10:15,800 --> 02:10:18,200
Then maybe

1885
02:10:21,920 --> 02:10:23,720
you see

1886
02:10:23,760 --> 02:10:26,000
the information

1887
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:31,480
from the backend.

1888
02:10:31,480 --> 02:10:34,200
And then uh,

1889
02:10:35,880 --> 02:10:38,480
so once
we have the information from the front end

1890
02:10:38,480 --> 02:10:43,160
and the back end, then we will do that
verification thing, right?

1891
02:10:44,040 --> 02:10:48,320
And verify

1892
02:10:50,120 --> 02:10:54,600
the result from UI and backend.

1893
02:10:55,040 --> 02:10:57,960
Yeah.

1894
02:10:57,960 --> 02:11:01,200
So we need to implement these three steps

1895
02:11:01,800 --> 02:11:04,920
then will be expected
results should be when

1896
02:11:06,560 --> 02:11:09,360
or and why you start your scenario

1897
02:11:09,360 --> 02:11:11,760
with and or

1898
02:11:12,840 --> 02:11:15,120
when and then and then

1899
02:11:17,640 --> 02:11:19,640
and then

1900
02:11:21,640 --> 02:11:24,600
then and

1901
02:11:24,600 --> 02:11:29,720
that it look good
because we have background.

1902
02:11:29,720 --> 02:11:32,920
I don't know anything about cucumber guys
you see you guys are

1903
02:11:33,240 --> 02:11:35,280
you guys are teaching me flip open the

1904
02:11:41,080 --> 02:11:43,600
it does
not matter we can start from anything

1905
02:11:44,520 --> 02:11:47,600
okay so I have written a scenario guide

1906
02:11:49,080 --> 02:11:51,120
what should be my next step.

1907
02:11:51,120 --> 02:11:56,280
What should be my next step?

1908
02:11:56,280 --> 02:11:59,680
So now I should dry run

1909
02:12:00,320 --> 02:12:03,720
so that these steps
which are not implemented,

1910
02:12:04,200 --> 02:12:06,600
I can kind of get those or

1911
02:12:07,120 --> 02:12:10,120
generated methods for these things.

1912
02:12:10,120 --> 02:12:10,440
Right.

1913
02:12:10,440 --> 02:12:14,480
So let me copy this bag from here.

1914
02:12:14,480 --> 02:12:18,240
Let's go to smoke.

1915
02:12:18,240 --> 02:12:21,200
And and instead of that one,

1916
02:12:21,320 --> 02:12:24,680
let's put the be bright run next book.

1917
02:12:24,720 --> 02:12:25,280
Cool.

1918
02:12:25,280 --> 02:12:26,400
Looks good

1919
02:12:29,040 --> 02:12:29,280
today.

1920
02:12:29,280 --> 02:12:32,560
Click on Execute.

1921
02:12:32,560 --> 02:12:40,440
Okay.

1922
02:12:40,440 --> 02:12:42,840
So definitely it will fail.

1923
02:12:43,800 --> 02:12:45,880
And now I have the

1924
02:12:47,920 --> 02:12:51,160
definition for the capturing ID

1925
02:12:52,040 --> 02:12:56,000
so I have steps in here.

1926
02:12:56,120 --> 02:12:56,960
Right.

1927
02:12:57,080 --> 02:13:00,840
And in the inside of the steps
I have this add employee steps.

1928
02:13:00,960 --> 02:13:10,120
So should I put it inside this class
or under some other classes?

1929
02:13:10,120 --> 02:13:14,200
Actually, I am planning to
create another step class for

1930
02:13:15,520 --> 02:13:17,880
this duty database team

1931
02:13:19,800 --> 02:13:24,480
so that we can put all the database
recruiting things inside of that.

1932
02:13:25,040 --> 02:13:26,160
So let's go.

1933
02:13:26,160 --> 02:13:27,360
Are you guys following me? Right.

1934
02:13:27,360 --> 02:13:30,520
You guys are following me.

1935
02:13:30,520 --> 02:13:34,840
Okay, so, so many steps, steps

1936
02:13:34,880 --> 02:13:37,120
that flexible all the way down

1937
02:13:38,360 --> 02:13:41,320
next to started in here?

1938
02:13:41,320 --> 02:13:44,440
No, not in here

1939
02:13:44,440 --> 02:13:47,440
and here.

1940
02:13:47,440 --> 02:13:49,600
Okay.

1941
02:13:52,280 --> 02:13:53,040
So, guys,

1942
02:13:53,040 --> 02:13:57,160
once I have the all ready,

1943
02:13:58,200 --> 02:14:00,440
how can I get the

1944
02:14:00,480 --> 02:14:04,440
have you guys already created objects
to get the already.

1945
02:14:05,280 --> 02:14:07,600
Let me check

1946
02:14:08,120 --> 02:14:11,120
the new page first.

1947
02:14:11,360 --> 02:14:13,320
This is the employer ID right.

1948
02:14:13,320 --> 02:14:16,880
The web element to get the employer ID

1949
02:14:23,320 --> 02:14:23,600
please

1950
02:14:23,600 --> 02:14:27,960
do not break our framework
that is I'm I'm doing nothing.

1951
02:14:28,200 --> 02:14:31,280
All all I'm doing is just following

1952
02:14:31,280 --> 02:14:36,800
your commands.

1953
02:14:36,800 --> 02:14:38,160
So how can I do that?

1954
02:14:38,160 --> 02:14:45,960
But which class object I need?

1955
02:14:45,960 --> 02:14:49,200
Add new employee page.

1956
02:14:49,200 --> 02:14:50,280
I want to get the ID

1957
02:15:02,600 --> 02:15:04,680
of a and

1958
02:15:04,680 --> 02:15:09,360
guys, let's create one more class inside
your utils.

1959
02:15:09,360 --> 02:15:16,800
Let's create a new class
inside your utils.

1960
02:15:16,800 --> 02:15:19,400
Let's call it global

1961
02:15:20,640 --> 02:15:22,240
variables

1962
02:15:29,600 --> 02:15:32,920
and alert.

1963
02:15:32,920 --> 02:15:34,960
Let's create a variable.

1964
02:15:35,240 --> 02:15:37,920
You already have this case.

1965
02:15:38,520 --> 02:15:44,400
Global variables class.

1966
02:15:44,400 --> 02:15:45,720
No, that is different.

1967
02:15:45,720 --> 02:15:48,400
The initialization or initialize
the initialize

1968
02:15:48,440 --> 02:15:51,080
there is different page and slightly

1969
02:15:53,160 --> 02:15:54,920
public

1970
02:15:56,720 --> 02:15:58,760
static

1971
02:16:00,880 --> 02:16:02,080
string.

1972
02:16:03,160 --> 02:16:05,520
Let's call it MP.

1973
02:16:05,520 --> 02:16:13,560
Right.

1974
02:16:13,560 --> 02:16:16,320
And all.

1975
02:16:16,320 --> 02:16:19,240
So once we have this

1976
02:16:19,240 --> 02:16:22,480
add dot

1977
02:16:22,480 --> 02:16:24,240
mp id lock. Right.

1978
02:16:24,240 --> 02:16:26,640
This is what contains the ID.

1979
02:16:26,920 --> 02:16:30,120
So I will say get attribute and let's

1980
02:16:30,360 --> 02:16:33,360
take the value of it.

1981
02:16:33,560 --> 02:16:36,560
And last, let's store

1982
02:16:36,600 --> 02:16:39,920
that inside global variables.

1983
02:16:39,960 --> 02:16:43,440
Dot MP IP

1984
02:16:53,440 --> 02:16:56,240
and I am keeping things simple,

1985
02:16:56,240 --> 02:17:00,640
so it just contains a public

1986
02:17:00,640 --> 02:17:04,640
static variable string variable.

1987
02:17:04,640 --> 02:17:05,160
Okay.

1988
02:17:07,760 --> 02:17:08,160
Okay.

1989
02:17:08,160 --> 02:17:40,200
Yep. Yep. Yep.

1990
02:17:40,200 --> 02:17:44,000
I can issue with scenario for one second.

1991
02:17:44,040 --> 02:17:47,320
Yep. Are you guys
done? The global variables

1992
02:17:49,400 --> 02:17:51,480
scenario for a section

1993
02:17:51,920 --> 02:17:57,200
here is automatically.

1994
02:17:57,200 --> 02:17:59,040
Can you show steps? Yes.

1995
02:17:59,040 --> 02:18:04,320
You just give me one moment.

1996
02:18:04,320 --> 02:18:07,480
The steps. No, sorry.

1997
02:18:07,480 --> 02:18:09,760
Not the steps.

1998
02:18:09,760 --> 02:18:15,520
We see all the steps.

1999
02:18:15,520 --> 02:18:19,200
You don't have to create
an object of an employ page.

2000
02:18:19,280 --> 02:18:23,840
Okay, You guys can get this information
in many, many different ways.

2001
02:18:23,840 --> 02:18:36,400
Whatever way source you
you guys can use that.

2002
02:18:36,400 --> 02:18:39,440
You guys literally know
more about cucumber than me.

2003
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:44,520
It's been a while
since I looked at things about cucumber.

2004
02:18:45,160 --> 02:18:48,960
Can someone copy MP I lock for me.

2005
02:18:48,960 --> 02:18:50,760
I missed that location.

2006
02:18:50,760 --> 02:18:53,320
I need the

2007
02:18:56,840 --> 02:18:57,720
this one

2008
02:18:59,040 --> 02:19:04,640
and let me know guys, once you are ready

2009
02:19:04,680 --> 02:19:26,480
so that we can move forward.

2010
02:19:26,480 --> 02:19:31,280
So when the when this step
will be executed what will happen?

2011
02:19:31,720 --> 02:19:33,360
The employ I.D.

2012
02:19:33,360 --> 02:19:37,560
from that page, the value of that employee
I need will index stored

2013
02:19:38,160 --> 02:19:40,760
inside this MP underscore ID.

2014
02:19:40,960 --> 02:19:41,400
Right?

2015
02:19:42,680 --> 02:19:46,080
And then because it is a static variable,

2016
02:19:46,080 --> 02:19:50,720
we can access this information
anywhere inside this project easily.

2017
02:19:50,720 --> 02:19:53,400
So that's why I have stored
this MP sitting here.

2018
02:19:53,640 --> 02:19:57,760
There's also got the first name guys,
and that's also going to be first name.

2019
02:19:57,760 --> 02:20:04,360
So Global variable start.

2020
02:20:04,360 --> 02:20:09,800
First name is equal to law

2021
02:20:11,760 --> 02:20:14,680
class named that you

2022
02:20:16,440 --> 02:20:17,600
value

2023
02:20:18,720 --> 02:20:20,800
and yes, you will be getting an error.

2024
02:20:20,800 --> 02:20:24,080
You can or enter
and you can click on create

2025
02:20:24,080 --> 02:20:27,280
for the first name in global application
just like this

2026
02:20:28,640 --> 02:20:30,960
and an enter field to indicate.

2027
02:20:30,960 --> 02:20:37,880
So we will only verify the first name.

2028
02:20:37,880 --> 02:20:40,680
Also guys, this website has a bug.

2029
02:20:40,880 --> 02:20:45,600
So will we see the same first name
that we enter inside that page?

2030
02:20:45,880 --> 02:20:49,320
We should we see the same
first name from the backend

2031
02:20:50,680 --> 02:20:51,600
we should see,

2032
02:20:51,600 --> 02:20:55,520
but we will not see the same information
in the back end.

2033
02:20:55,520 --> 02:20:56,240
Right?

2034
02:20:56,240 --> 02:21:01,560
So this scenario,
if we don't see the actual information,

2035
02:21:01,560 --> 02:21:04,640
if the information does not match,
then should pass

2036
02:21:04,680 --> 02:21:08,240
in our current scenario
because we have a bug index.

2037
02:21:08,720 --> 02:21:12,080
So I will talk to the developers as well
today after this class

2038
02:21:12,120 --> 02:21:14,040
so that they can fix that bug.

2039
02:21:14,040 --> 02:21:18,600
But we will write a scenario in which
we will make sure that the first name

2040
02:21:18,600 --> 02:21:24,840
that we are putting from the frontend
is not same, that we get from the backend.

2041
02:21:24,840 --> 02:21:27,600
This is how the website is behaving
currently, right?

2042
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,040
If I am not wrong

2043
02:21:44,560 --> 02:21:48,240
or a also

2044
02:21:48,840 --> 02:21:51,840
just to make sure that

2045
02:21:53,040 --> 02:21:56,240
just to make sure
that we are getting all the information

2046
02:21:56,240 --> 02:21:59,920
from backend and further,
let's also print out this information

2047
02:22:01,040 --> 02:22:07,040
in here. So

2048
02:22:09,600 --> 02:22:12,520
MP underscore I'd be

2049
02:22:20,760 --> 02:22:23,480
R&D and

2050
02:22:27,600 --> 02:22:32,600
the first rule we always do

2051
02:22:33,520 --> 02:22:35,160
get the first

2052
02:22:38,600 --> 02:22:41,000
me know

2053
02:22:41,120 --> 02:22:55,640
once you guys have by default.

2054
02:22:55,640 --> 02:23:01,640
So we have successfully implemented
one step in here right?

2055
02:23:01,640 --> 02:23:04,560
Let's check the next step

2056
02:23:08,400 --> 02:23:10,600
then verify the results

2057
02:23:10,600 --> 02:23:15,320
from the UI and the backend of the.

2058
02:23:15,320 --> 02:23:19,080
So let's create
a separate class for No, no, no.

2059
02:23:19,080 --> 02:23:24,080
We should also be having
one more step, right? Yes.

2060
02:23:24,080 --> 02:23:27,920
You read the information from the backend,
looks something like this.

2061
02:23:28,440 --> 02:23:33,960
So I am creating a separate class
to write all the steps that involve

2062
02:23:34,400 --> 02:23:36,680
during the recoveries

2063
02:23:43,520 --> 02:23:45,160
and you send the page or.

2064
02:23:45,160 --> 02:23:51,360
Yes. Or I'm just going.

2065
02:23:51,360 --> 02:23:54,720
So let's define this step in here.

2066
02:23:54,720 --> 02:23:58,400
You want the adding place
page dot feature on the page.

2067
02:23:59,400 --> 02:24:01,040
This add new imply page.

2068
02:24:01,040 --> 02:24:01,880
This one

2069
02:24:05,640 --> 02:24:06,720
along with

2070
02:24:07,560 --> 02:24:09,680
well but you why do you guys need

2071
02:24:09,960 --> 02:24:15,040
Have you not launched
the French project from GitHub?

2072
02:24:15,040 --> 02:24:16,960
You guys might run into problems

2073
02:24:16,960 --> 02:24:21,200
if you are having some things
missing in your framework.

2074
02:24:21,200 --> 02:24:23,520
Can you try to furthermore
define those things?

2075
02:24:24,360 --> 02:24:26,560
Oh, you lost, but I don't think so.

2076
02:24:26,560 --> 02:24:30,760
You have made any changes in here?

2077
02:24:30,760 --> 02:24:43,000
I have not made any changes in here,
so let's implement

2078
02:24:43,160 --> 02:24:45,480
this part of the code as well.

2079
02:24:46,760 --> 02:24:49,360
But before I am using my framework

2080
02:24:49,360 --> 02:24:51,520
code, I don't regret this defeat.

2081
02:24:53,160 --> 02:24:55,880
We're willing to be personal.

2082
02:24:55,880 --> 02:24:58,520
Link to the first, don't link it anywhere.

2083
02:24:58,520 --> 02:25:01,480
Distorted entire the global variables.

2084
02:25:01,880 --> 02:25:22,320
If you are unable to follow me, you can
you can stop me.

2085
02:25:22,320 --> 02:25:28,360
So now this is the time to write back.

2086
02:25:28,360 --> 02:25:33,920
And let's just store the variables
inside the global variables class.

2087
02:25:33,920 --> 02:25:55,960
Just store this idea and first name.

2088
02:25:55,960 --> 02:25:57,920
Then you open global variables.

2089
02:25:57,920 --> 02:26:00,480
New. Yep.

2090
02:26:00,480 --> 02:26:17,360
This is the global variables.

2091
02:26:17,360 --> 02:26:33,680
Is there anyone else
who is lagging behind?

2092
02:26:33,680 --> 02:26:35,400
It's all crazy. My you.

2093
02:26:35,400 --> 02:26:38,920
You both die together like the way

2094
02:26:39,320 --> 02:26:42,400
it was written in behind the card there
there are no bags.

2095
02:26:42,400 --> 02:26:46,520
Will will die like legend tries
to be like three elements.

2096
02:26:47,560 --> 02:26:49,680
You implement one method So far? Yes.

2097
02:26:49,720 --> 02:26:50,840
One step so far.

2098
02:26:50,840 --> 02:26:54,400
Yes. No. We please open query database.

2099
02:26:54,400 --> 02:27:17,960
There is nothing in particular database
except that step.

2100
02:27:17,960 --> 02:27:19,240
I have error.

2101
02:27:19,240 --> 02:27:24,560
Alex, are you using your
have you uploaded a fresh project

2102
02:27:24,560 --> 02:27:30,480
or you are using an existing framework?

2103
02:27:30,480 --> 02:27:34,720
Then you should not be having this issue.

2104
02:27:34,720 --> 02:27:37,640
Then you should not be having this issue

2105
02:27:44,200 --> 02:27:44,720
global.

2106
02:27:44,720 --> 02:27:46,640
It is boarding for

2107
02:27:46,880 --> 02:27:48,480
an employee.

2108
02:27:48,480 --> 02:27:49,640
No, no, no.

2109
02:27:49,880 --> 02:27:51,320
The class name is different.

2110
02:27:51,320 --> 02:27:54,200
Not on the class name is different.
You have missed by for the class name.

2111
02:27:54,200 --> 02:27:56,440
The class name is

2112
02:27:56,440 --> 02:27:58,080
really that

2113
02:28:05,960 --> 02:28:08,160
it is add new employee page.

2114
02:28:08,640 --> 02:28:11,080
You have written add employer steps

2115
02:28:15,560 --> 02:28:18,520
it should we add new employee page?

2116
02:28:19,800 --> 02:28:31,640
Is there anyone else
who is getting any issues?

2117
02:28:31,640 --> 02:28:34,440
All good. So again,
I move to the next step.

2118
02:28:34,480 --> 02:28:39,360
Guys.

2119
02:28:39,360 --> 02:28:41,280
So now we need to

2120
02:28:42,840 --> 02:28:46,280
have a class inside the European spec

2121
02:28:46,520 --> 02:28:51,960
so as we have methods, common methods,
configurator constraint, excavators.

2122
02:28:52,480 --> 02:28:57,840
Now we will also have a class that will
help us deal with the databases, right?

2123
02:28:57,840 --> 02:29:00,760
So let's create a class

2124
02:29:00,760 --> 02:29:03,040
and let's call it

2125
02:29:04,440 --> 02:29:05,760
baby utils.

2126
02:29:05,760 --> 02:29:10,400
So it will have all the common methods
that we can use reused again and again.

2127
02:29:10,400 --> 02:29:13,800
Right? So db utils

2128
02:29:13,800 --> 02:29:15,640
and the methods

2129
02:29:15,640 --> 02:29:19,640
that we wrote inside in here,
inside of this neighborhood

2130
02:29:19,680 --> 02:29:21,720
is let's copy these methods

2131
02:29:34,920 --> 02:29:38,640
and also

2132
02:29:38,640 --> 02:29:40,400
let's do this guys,

2133
02:29:40,400 --> 02:29:43,120
the last method that we developed,

2134
02:29:44,520 --> 02:29:47,480
let's
copy this method and let's modify this

2135
02:29:47,480 --> 02:29:52,880
so that once we put a wide acuity to this
method,

2136
02:29:54,360 --> 02:29:57,120
we get a list of maps

2137
02:29:57,360 --> 02:30:01,400
that contains the results
set against that guilty.

2138
02:30:03,160 --> 02:30:06,080
So let me copy this piece of information

2139
02:30:06,080 --> 02:30:14,520
in here, and let's create a method to

2140
02:30:16,360 --> 02:30:20,400
complete a static list

2141
02:30:23,880 --> 02:30:28,320
list of maps.

2142
02:30:28,320 --> 02:30:31,360
And we contain

2143
02:30:31,360 --> 02:30:32,360
strings

2144
02:30:41,160 --> 02:30:43,400
and let's call it get

2145
02:30:44,520 --> 02:30:49,760
able that is.

2146
02:30:50,520 --> 02:30:54,440
And in here we will be providing

2147
02:30:56,480 --> 02:30:59,480
only the query, right?

2148
02:30:59,480 --> 02:31:03,080
Let's be based
whatever code we have written in here

2149
02:31:03,080 --> 02:31:10,640
and looks modified, the results.

2150
02:31:10,640 --> 02:31:13,920
So what do you guys think we are?

2151
02:31:13,920 --> 02:31:16,320
Should I call this piece of information?

2152
02:31:16,320 --> 02:31:18,480
Should it go inside?

2153
02:31:18,480 --> 02:31:21,720
Global Variables Configurator

2154
02:31:21,720 --> 02:31:24,520
Constants Configuration file.

2155
02:31:24,840 --> 02:31:35,240
Where should I put this this?

2156
02:31:35,240 --> 02:31:38,160
I should do this

2157
02:31:39,760 --> 02:31:41,560
inside the configurator.

2158
02:31:41,560 --> 02:31:44,160
This is where
I will put the information. Right?

2159
02:31:44,160 --> 02:31:51,720
So I will say.

2160
02:31:51,720 --> 02:31:55,360
So let's change it to

2161
02:31:56,480 --> 02:31:56,920
maybe

2162
02:31:56,920 --> 02:32:04,040
password.

2163
02:32:04,040 --> 02:32:06,120
Go back to utils so we can.

2164
02:32:06,120 --> 02:32:08,720
You want me to go back
to your distributive

2165
02:32:12,320 --> 02:32:31,400
property?

2166
02:32:31,400 --> 02:32:34,920
Where did we based From the demo

2167
02:32:34,920 --> 02:32:37,920
that we did before the break.

2168
02:32:37,920 --> 02:32:41,520
Okay, let me develop this db utils method
then I will share with you

2169
02:32:42,240 --> 02:32:46,360
the last demo.

2170
02:32:46,360 --> 02:32:48,640
Let me let me develop it completely.

2171
02:32:49,240 --> 02:32:51,000
Then I would share it. So guys,

2172
02:32:52,560 --> 02:32:56,120
I have stored the information in here.

2173
02:32:57,080 --> 02:33:01,360
Now how can I bring this information
from here

2174
02:33:02,120 --> 02:33:07,080
inside this DB Which class
I should use to fight this information?

2175
02:33:07,080 --> 02:33:08,560
I need this information in here.

2176
02:33:08,560 --> 02:33:14,160
DB You are a username and password,

2177
02:33:14,160 --> 02:33:18,280
so I should use my configurator
config reader Dog

2178
02:33:19,880 --> 02:33:22,920
guard property value.

2179
02:33:22,920 --> 02:33:26,280
And what do I specify
inside the get property guide?

2180
02:33:27,520 --> 02:33:30,840
I specify the name of the property.

2181
02:33:30,840 --> 02:33:38,840
What is the name of the property?

2182
02:33:38,840 --> 02:33:40,880
This is the name of the property. Right?

2183
02:33:40,880 --> 02:33:43,640
So db is

2184
02:33:44,320 --> 02:33:45,840
like this.

2185
02:33:45,880 --> 02:33:47,080
Then again.

2186
02:33:47,080 --> 02:33:49,440
Okay.

2187
02:33:49,440 --> 02:33:52,960
Same for the

2188
02:33:53,080 --> 02:33:54,640
username

2189
02:33:55,320 --> 02:33:56,440
and password.

2190
02:33:56,440 --> 02:33:57,360
Right.

2191
02:33:57,640 --> 02:34:00,000
So guys, make sure that you guys are using
the exact

2192
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,040
same simple

2193
02:34:03,920 --> 02:34:07,000
username and password.

2194
02:34:08,520 --> 02:34:10,160
All looks good

2195
02:34:11,800 --> 02:34:17,640
up till now.

2196
02:34:17,640 --> 02:34:18,200
Okay.

2197
02:34:19,160 --> 02:34:23,520
Do you guys need these comments
or I should remove it to just make sure

2198
02:34:23,520 --> 02:34:24,840
the code.

2199
02:34:24,840 --> 02:34:30,440
I think it will be better
to keep these comments right.

2200
02:34:30,440 --> 02:34:30,800
Okay.

2201
02:34:30,800 --> 02:34:37,440
So we have created the connection
right now instead of hard coding the query

2202
02:34:39,120 --> 02:34:41,760
should change to config.

2203
02:34:42,240 --> 02:34:44,080
Okay.

2204
02:34:44,080 --> 02:34:46,240
In the config

2205
02:34:46,360 --> 02:34:50,480
we have added the WRAL username
and password and the will.

2206
02:34:50,480 --> 02:34:57,880
Do you want me to send it to you?

2207
02:34:57,880 --> 02:35:03,760
Oh, here it is.

2208
02:35:03,760 --> 02:35:04,920
Come on

2209
02:35:11,040 --> 02:35:11,400
today.

2210
02:35:11,440 --> 02:35:12,200
Stop.

2211
02:35:12,880 --> 02:35:13,760
Stop. Are you.

2212
02:35:13,760 --> 02:35:16,120
Is it worth effort and the code.

2213
02:35:16,120 --> 02:35:18,200
Let me modify it completely.

2214
02:35:18,200 --> 02:35:29,040
Let me do the modification
then I need you.

2215
02:35:29,040 --> 02:35:30,840
Do you guys know your goal?

2216
02:35:30,840 --> 02:35:33,040
Any one of you know
you are going from batch?

2217
02:35:33,080 --> 02:35:43,080
Well, no.

2218
02:35:44,640 --> 02:35:45,920
Okay.

2219
02:35:45,920 --> 02:35:51,040
So what I see is both so many questions
in this channel.

2220
02:35:51,040 --> 02:35:54,840
I mean, literally, if there is a semicolon
missing, she will not look at it.

2221
02:35:55,200 --> 02:35:58,080
She will pass
first post request an export channel,

2222
02:35:58,440 --> 02:36:00,360
and then she will

2223
02:36:02,480 --> 02:36:03,240
be calling.

2224
02:36:03,240 --> 02:36:05,680
This is missing.

2225
02:36:06,040 --> 02:36:06,960
I know.

2226
02:36:08,600 --> 02:36:11,400
So the duty that is being passed to this

2227
02:36:11,400 --> 02:36:15,480
method, I will
I will pass this query in here

2228
02:36:17,960 --> 02:36:20,840
inside to the executed right.

2229
02:36:20,840 --> 02:36:22,920
Then it will automatically check

2230
02:36:22,920 --> 02:36:25,520
all the columns that are inside of this

2231
02:36:26,080 --> 02:36:28,080
that we are getting

2232
02:36:28,560 --> 02:36:31,160
as a result of this query

2233
02:36:31,160 --> 02:36:34,880
and a list of map will be created.

2234
02:36:35,560 --> 02:36:36,680
Do I need this for.

2235
02:36:36,680 --> 02:36:43,800
Look guys,
it only prints the column names.

2236
02:36:43,800 --> 02:36:45,160
Do I need this?

2237
02:36:45,920 --> 02:36:49,160
I know this time

2238
02:36:49,160 --> 02:36:52,440
I also don't need this new line.

2239
02:36:53,560 --> 02:36:55,560
I create bitmaps

2240
02:36:55,560 --> 02:36:59,160
then copy all these
that are stored inside of the table row.

2241
02:36:59,160 --> 02:37:01,680
I also don't need to print in here.

2242
02:37:01,680 --> 02:37:03,920
I also don't need this one.

2243
02:37:03,920 --> 02:37:06,960
And once I am done I close the connection.

2244
02:37:06,960 --> 02:37:09,000
And finally I have done

2245
02:37:13,280 --> 02:37:20,360
the table

2246
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:23,640
that I have declared this.

2247
02:37:23,640 --> 02:37:26,200
So it should be

2248
02:37:26,200 --> 02:37:28,640
before the project

2249
02:37:28,920 --> 02:37:36,840
so that we can easily access it.

2250
02:37:36,840 --> 02:37:38,280
And then I return

2251
02:37:39,960 --> 02:37:41,080
the table

2252
02:37:41,080 --> 02:37:45,000
that right?

2253
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:47,600
Why? We get an error

2254
02:37:47,920 --> 02:37:52,320
list of map strings, string.

2255
02:37:52,320 --> 02:37:54,720
Oh we have not initialized it very.

2256
02:37:54,720 --> 02:37:58,040
The table

2257
02:37:59,160 --> 02:38:01,560
variable that might not have any fly.

2258
02:38:01,680 --> 02:38:02,160
Okay.

2259
02:38:02,160 --> 02:38:08,160
But we're on

2260
02:38:09,160 --> 02:38:11,240
here. Not appropriate.

2261
02:38:11,240 --> 02:38:11,880
Let's

2262
02:38:13,560 --> 02:38:14,920
all looks good.

2263
02:38:14,920 --> 02:38:19,200
So what will happen
once we pass the query to this method?

2264
02:38:20,200 --> 02:38:22,600
We will get a list of maps

2265
02:38:22,600 --> 02:38:25,560
that will contain the data against this.

2266
02:38:26,040 --> 02:38:26,880
All looks good.

2267
02:38:26,880 --> 02:38:30,240
All clear. Any confidence?

2268
02:38:30,320 --> 02:38:32,760
I need your db utils after

2269
02:38:32,880 --> 02:38:35,760
you are sure I will get it right.

2270
02:38:36,040 --> 02:38:43,720
Do you guys have any questions?

2271
02:38:43,720 --> 02:38:48,600
Do you guys want me to share
the complete utils or just this table

2272
02:38:48,600 --> 02:39:20,520
that our method complete?

2273
02:39:20,520 --> 02:39:28,640
There is no more?

2274
02:39:28,640 --> 02:39:33,680
Might need to change the variable name
for database user name and password.

2275
02:39:33,680 --> 02:39:35,520
Yes. Yes.

2276
02:39:35,520 --> 02:39:38,440
Yes and yes. You are right.

2277
02:39:38,520 --> 02:39:40,920
Nice build. Right.

2278
02:39:40,920 --> 02:39:43,120
What did I do with the names I use?

2279
02:39:43,960 --> 02:39:48,120
User name?

2280
02:39:48,120 --> 02:39:49,040
Okay. So

2281
02:39:51,880 --> 02:39:53,520
I think I updated it.

2282
02:39:53,520 --> 02:39:54,600
DB password.

2283
02:39:54,600 --> 02:39:59,000
I have already updated it.

2284
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:02,760
No. Yes, you're right.

2285
02:40:02,800 --> 02:40:04,720
We don't need to modify.

2286
02:40:04,720 --> 02:40:08,880
Okay then this method looks good.

2287
02:40:08,880 --> 02:40:09,520
Okay.

2288
02:40:09,600 --> 02:40:19,800
So do we have a break up?

2289
02:40:19,800 --> 02:40:22,680
So as per the instructions from Manager
Lobo,

2290
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:26,280
could you scroll down?

2291
02:40:26,280 --> 02:40:29,040
Guys, let me do
the second push this to GitHub

2292
02:40:29,760 --> 02:40:38,000
so that you guys can, you guys can chat

2293
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:51,320
and get all the objects.

2294
02:40:51,320 --> 02:40:54,520
So we finally played this game

2295
02:40:59,520 --> 02:41:01,080
here is defined

2296
02:41:01,760 --> 02:41:03,920
and the code has been pushed.

2297
02:41:03,920 --> 02:41:09,840
You guys can also get it from this.

2298
02:41:09,840 --> 02:41:16,240
We can.

2299
02:41:16,240 --> 02:41:19,480
You guys.

2300
02:41:19,480 --> 02:41:21,360
What happened to your analogy?

2301
02:41:21,360 --> 02:41:26,640
I remember those days, initial Java days,
everyone was so

2302
02:41:26,640 --> 02:41:30,800
and rejected to be posting
so many questions

2303
02:41:33,840 --> 02:41:36,240
and everything is dead

2304
02:41:36,760 --> 02:41:39,720
inside is

2305
02:41:41,280 --> 02:41:42,960
red. That is missing my mood

2306
02:41:44,240 --> 02:41:45,360
battery low.

2307
02:41:45,360 --> 02:41:49,280
I think we are really tired
doing assignments.

2308
02:41:49,280 --> 02:41:52,600
I think just 25 or 20 more days. Right.

2309
02:41:52,760 --> 02:41:56,320
How many more guys before
you are done with your API classes then?

2310
02:41:56,640 --> 02:41:58,680
These are the mandatory classes.

2311
02:41:58,680 --> 02:42:01,040
All other things are optional.

2312
02:42:01,040 --> 02:42:03,280
Two weeks, just 15 days, guys.

2313
02:42:03,320 --> 02:42:08,480
Just for 15 days. Yes.

2314
02:42:08,480 --> 02:42:10,560
Please have some

2315
02:42:13,040 --> 02:42:14,880
something to keep your end ready for.

2316
02:42:14,880 --> 02:42:15,920
Next two weeks.

2317
02:42:15,920 --> 02:42:19,720
Will we have access to video recording
after we finish to revise the concept?

2318
02:42:19,720 --> 02:42:21,360
Oh, don't worry. About that.

2319
02:42:21,360 --> 02:42:23,520
I think still

2320
02:42:23,520 --> 02:42:25,800
there was a student from Batch six.

2321
02:42:25,800 --> 02:42:27,880
I don't know what happened to him.

2322
02:42:27,880 --> 02:42:31,680
And after six he now there are two.

2323
02:42:31,680 --> 02:42:33,920
Have the access any large pool again?

2324
02:42:33,920 --> 02:42:37,680
Go on the market
and you want to prepare everything.

2325
02:42:37,680 --> 02:42:42,240
So I am still helping him
plot his interviews coding as guiding you

2326
02:42:42,360 --> 02:42:45,360
everything. Don't worry about that.

2327
02:42:45,360 --> 02:42:48,840
I find you a little difficult then.

2328
02:42:48,840 --> 02:42:50,800
Other topics we learned so far.

2329
02:42:50,800 --> 02:42:52,080
All that's very different

2330
02:42:54,120 --> 02:42:58,200
and I'll

2331
02:42:59,320 --> 02:43:01,800
be bringing you

2332
02:43:07,920 --> 02:43:13,560
so that I can also use something.

2333
02:43:13,560 --> 02:43:22,440
20 minutes will be enough, right?

2334
02:43:22,440 --> 02:43:26,240
Please be back by 137.

2335
02:43:26,240 --> 02:43:29,400
But no appetite so that

2336
02:43:29,600 --> 02:43:32,280
I don't know all the details,

2337
02:43:32,680 --> 02:43:36,000
but it does mean something related.

2338
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:37,280
Food. Right.

2339
02:43:37,280 --> 02:43:38,640
All right, guys, please.

2340
02:43:38,640 --> 02:43:41,280
If you are facing an issues,
please read all your issues.

2341
02:43:41,280 --> 02:43:45,160
Make sure you are in sync with me
after the break.

2342
02:43:45,160 --> 02:43:50,520
And will have followed all the steps here.

2343
02:43:50,520 --> 02:43:52,880
Have a nice minute.
Thank you, guys. I see you.

2344
02:43:53,240 --> 02:43:57,720
I think we should revise all of this again
if we want to change our job in future.

2345
02:43:58,440 --> 02:44:00,200
Yes, definitely.

2346
02:44:00,200 --> 02:44:01,680
You guys are right.

2347
02:44:01,920 --> 02:44:04,080
Should not quit on us.

2348
02:44:04,560 --> 02:44:08,160
I think we are still missing two steps,
so I don't know what

2349
02:44:08,160 --> 02:44:09,520
will be the results. Want

2350
02:44:12,720 --> 02:44:14,280
to upload the code we use?

2351
02:44:14,280 --> 02:44:17,000
Get fetch to upload the code?

2352
02:44:17,280 --> 02:44:17,880
No. No.

2353
02:44:17,880 --> 02:44:18,680
To upload the code.

2354
02:44:18,680 --> 02:44:19,080
Why would?

2355
02:44:19,080 --> 02:44:22,200
We use the fetch

2356
02:44:22,320 --> 02:44:23,920
on date.

2357
02:44:24,440 --> 02:44:27,920
You mean download to download the code

2358
02:44:27,960 --> 02:44:34,200
to clone it.

2359
02:44:34,200 --> 02:44:36,640
Updated

2360
02:44:39,160 --> 02:44:43,920
to update the code.

2361
02:44:43,920 --> 02:44:44,840
Just press this.

2362
02:44:44,840 --> 02:44:47,760
This blue arrow, this update project.

2363
02:44:49,720 --> 02:44:51,200
No, no, no. Don't clone it again.

2364
02:44:51,200 --> 02:44:54,840
Just Click on this blue arrow.

2365
02:44:54,840 --> 02:44:58,320
Every one of you can get all of this
update by just speaking on this.

2366
02:44:58,320 --> 02:44:58,840
Settle

2367
02:45:04,240 --> 02:45:06,560
or you have also cloned from there.

2368
02:45:06,560 --> 02:45:11,000
And so you can click on this
and let the incoming changes in

2369
02:45:11,040 --> 02:45:13,560
to the current branch
and you can ignore your changes

2370
02:45:13,560 --> 02:45:16,040
with changes that you have made
and you can accept my changes.

2371
02:45:17,040 --> 02:45:19,320
Okay,
You guys are already pro in a good pride.

2372
02:45:19,440 --> 02:45:21,400
You should be teaching me how to use it.

2373
02:45:22,680 --> 02:45:24,720
I don't know anything about it.

2374
02:45:24,720 --> 02:45:26,680
I just know about these desperados.

2375
02:45:26,680 --> 02:45:27,480
Blue Arrow.

2376
02:45:27,480 --> 02:45:29,680
Green Arrow. Green Arrow Mean turned over.

2377
02:45:29,680 --> 02:45:33,080
The thing to the blue arrow means that
I would have been from bigger to

2378
02:45:41,840 --> 02:45:43,360
actually we lack knowledge of

2379
02:45:43,360 --> 02:45:47,160
get from intelligent directly.

2380
02:45:47,160 --> 02:45:50,720
Yes you guys are all next level actors

2381
02:45:51,200 --> 02:45:53,640
using command to do everything.

2382
02:45:54,840 --> 02:45:57,480
This is this guy is for

2383
02:45:58,920 --> 02:46:01,160
less knowledgeable persons like me.

2384
02:46:01,560 --> 02:46:24,600
I name it.

2385
02:46:24,600 --> 02:46:37,320
I think you have the wrong
Katrina in here.

2386
02:46:37,320 --> 02:46:38,360
Okay.

2387
02:46:38,360 --> 02:46:41,320
Or he will send me a message
that has some for us.

2388
02:46:41,520 --> 02:46:42,520
For us.

2389
02:46:42,520 --> 02:46:45,200
But thanks me for something.

2390
02:46:45,200 --> 02:46:47,480
She takes your duties very seriously.

2391
02:46:48,800 --> 02:46:49,840
All right, guys.

2392
02:46:49,840 --> 02:46:51,960
So I hope

2393
02:46:52,680 --> 02:46:56,560
all of you have this code

2394
02:46:56,560 --> 02:46:59,160
in your cucumber frameworks

2395
02:47:00,360 --> 02:47:02,760
that we have written in here

2396
02:47:02,760 --> 02:47:12,840
right.

2397
02:47:12,840 --> 02:47:14,440
Anyway, thanks, Carter.

2398
02:47:14,440 --> 02:47:17,560
Yawn. Now, after Katrina,

2399
02:47:18,760 --> 02:47:20,640
I almost

2400
02:47:20,640 --> 02:47:22,000
to be

2401
02:47:27,840 --> 02:47:28,600
okay.

2402
02:47:28,600 --> 02:47:35,480
So we have a method
that can give us detect.

2403
02:47:35,480 --> 02:47:38,800
You have the utilities.

2404
02:47:38,800 --> 02:47:41,400
So what were we doing, guys?

2405
02:47:42,480 --> 02:47:48,520
You were implementing these steps right.

2406
02:47:48,520 --> 02:47:51,720
Uh, which step we were implementing before

2407
02:47:51,720 --> 02:47:56,640
this.

2408
02:47:56,640 --> 02:47:59,040
So global variables in here.

2409
02:47:59,040 --> 02:48:04,880
And of course, I'll be damned
if that database right.

2410
02:48:04,880 --> 02:48:08,720
So guys write down right security

2411
02:48:08,760 --> 02:48:11,920
to bring the same information

2412
02:48:11,920 --> 02:48:18,520
from the database.

2413
02:48:18,520 --> 02:48:21,760
So if let's say

2414
02:48:21,760 --> 02:48:25,720
I give you this i.t write down acuity

2415
02:48:26,640 --> 02:48:30,200
to bring to fetch the first
and the last name

2416
02:48:30,840 --> 02:48:34,280
from the database in here.

2417
02:48:34,280 --> 02:49:03,080
Well we already had all this query.

2418
02:49:03,080 --> 02:49:06,120
Okay, so let me copy the security

2419
02:49:06,120 --> 02:49:12,240
from here.

2420
02:49:12,240 --> 02:49:14,440
So how can I write?

2421
02:49:15,240 --> 02:49:19,000
How can I which method I should call

2422
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:23,480
and where should I boss this query
or what would I do?

2423
02:49:23,480 --> 02:49:25,920
Guys, let's say spring

2424
02:49:27,240 --> 02:49:30,200
duty equal to this is my query.

2425
02:49:30,840 --> 02:49:33,960
So instead of hard coding this idea,

2426
02:49:34,720 --> 02:49:37,760
the idea that I have stored inside

2427
02:49:37,920 --> 02:49:42,360
Global Variables class,
I want to use that idea in here.

2428
02:49:42,360 --> 02:49:48,040
So I want to create the query
dynamically instead of hardening.

2429
02:49:48,040 --> 02:49:50,400
So how can I do that

2430
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:05,200
in the table?

2431
02:50:05,200 --> 02:50:08,360
Yes, but let's just let's first create
the query, Right?

2432
02:50:09,560 --> 02:50:10,880
Let's first create the query.

2433
02:50:10,880 --> 02:50:12,600
How can I do that

2434
02:50:13,800 --> 02:50:14,840
if I tried?

2435
02:50:14,840 --> 02:50:27,800
Plus signs in here, how can I
how can I modify the string I is Michael,

2436
02:50:27,880 --> 02:50:34,440
How can I modify the screen?

2437
02:50:34,440 --> 02:50:39,000
No, no one knows how to do that right?

2438
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:42,800
I have a string and I want to concatenate
i d with the string

2439
02:51:05,520 --> 02:51:08,960
or per here.

2440
02:51:09,360 --> 02:51:11,440
And so when we are calling

2441
02:51:13,960 --> 02:51:16,040
so delegate brains, then it's

2442
02:51:18,880 --> 02:51:20,040
E plus, plus

2443
02:51:20,040 --> 02:51:26,120
blah, blah, blah.

2444
02:51:26,120 --> 02:51:29,000
How can I concatenate a

2445
02:51:30,120 --> 02:51:32,560
I want to do a single code in here.

2446
02:51:32,560 --> 02:51:36,760
Is it okay.

2447
02:51:36,760 --> 02:51:40,680
Let me show you a demo actually first

2448
02:51:41,160 --> 02:51:43,000
baby wise

2449
02:51:43,080 --> 02:51:56,480
you have I think for what everything.

2450
02:51:56,480 --> 02:52:02,200
So what I have, let's say
if I have a string already in here,

2451
02:52:02,200 --> 02:52:04,880
something this let's

2452
02:52:18,760 --> 02:52:19,920
and if I do this

2453
02:52:19,920 --> 02:52:30,200
and then print out to verify my theory.

2454
02:52:30,200 --> 02:52:35,360
So I will be getting this security
as a result right?

2455
02:52:35,360 --> 02:52:39,360
If I do the concatenation this way,
I am copying the security from here

2456
02:52:40,200 --> 02:52:42,600
and I execute that.

2457
02:52:42,600 --> 02:52:46,120
You re in here. Whoops.

2458
02:52:46,120 --> 02:52:57,400
My little very quickly,
I don't get any results.

2459
02:52:57,920 --> 02:53:02,080
How can I write this code in here?

2460
02:53:02,400 --> 02:53:03,200
How can I do that

2461
02:53:11,920 --> 02:53:13,680
in double course

2462
02:53:14,880 --> 02:53:15,400
in here?

2463
02:53:15,400 --> 02:53:20,640
I need to run the single course like this.

2464
02:53:20,640 --> 02:53:29,080
Like this.

2465
02:53:29,080 --> 02:53:32,440
So if now I execute

2466
02:53:35,320 --> 02:53:37,440
in this query

2467
02:53:37,440 --> 02:53:40,040
new line for one, you want it.

2468
02:53:40,760 --> 02:53:43,720
You want to have new line

2469
02:53:47,160 --> 02:53:47,520
voting.

2470
02:53:47,520 --> 02:53:53,320
I be like,

2471
02:53:53,320 --> 02:54:03,000
Looks good, right?

2472
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:15,880
Look, copy this query unit
or bring it to our friend.

2473
02:54:15,880 --> 02:54:18,000
So single course in here

2474
02:54:19,680 --> 02:54:21,240
and in here.

2475
02:54:21,440 --> 02:54:26,600
So we have successfully created
the query seemed like only alone.

2476
02:54:26,600 --> 02:54:30,240
Our brains is working.

2477
02:54:30,240 --> 02:54:32,480
What is going on? I didn't not understand.

2478
02:54:32,720 --> 02:54:35,040
Most of you also don't understand.
It's fine.

2479
02:54:35,200 --> 02:54:37,200
I don't understand anything from love.

2480
02:54:37,200 --> 02:54:41,680
For the last seven years.

2481
02:54:41,680 --> 02:54:44,800
Why? We're near
the same query twice in my equal.

2482
02:54:46,280 --> 02:54:49,640
We don't need the same beauty
twice in equal.

2483
02:54:49,640 --> 02:54:53,640
We were just learning how to build

2484
02:54:53,640 --> 02:55:00,240
a query dynamically,

2485
02:55:00,240 --> 02:55:02,800
how to build a query,

2486
02:55:03,600 --> 02:55:07,320
how to build a curious heart,
how to build a query like this.

2487
02:55:07,840 --> 02:55:08,360
Right.

2488
02:55:08,360 --> 02:55:10,320
This is how we specify the idea, right?

2489
02:55:12,200 --> 02:55:12,560
You guys

2490
02:55:12,560 --> 02:55:16,480
remember if something is off,
what are data type

2491
02:55:16,480 --> 02:55:20,640
and if I am not using these codes in here,
do you guys remember

2492
02:55:20,640 --> 02:55:24,400
what happens?

2493
02:55:24,400 --> 02:55:27,280
You will not get the results.

2494
02:55:27,280 --> 02:55:30,840
You might not get an error,
but definitely not the proper results.

2495
02:55:31,120 --> 02:55:31,840
Right.

2496
02:55:31,880 --> 02:55:35,280
And in this case, because the dynamic URI
also contains a letter,

2497
02:55:35,280 --> 02:55:37,680
so definitely it will not work.

2498
02:55:37,680 --> 02:55:41,040
So that's why we learned
how to place these

2499
02:55:41,040 --> 02:55:44,280
a single course after and before we ID

2500
02:55:45,640 --> 02:55:46,200
should not.

2501
02:55:46,200 --> 02:55:48,480
We put this semicolon inside this thing.

2502
02:55:48,600 --> 02:55:49,480
It is not required.

2503
02:55:49,480 --> 02:55:51,760
But if you want to do that, you can do
that.

2504
02:55:51,840 --> 02:55:56,840
Semicolon is when you have
multiple queries inside an editor

2505
02:55:56,840 --> 02:56:01,800
or if you are executing multiple queries
to distinguish one query from another.

2506
02:56:01,800 --> 02:56:03,560
If the query is single.

2507
02:56:03,560 --> 02:56:06,920
So for example,
if I remove all of these queries

2508
02:56:07,800 --> 02:56:10,880
so I can also aggregate it
without the semicolon.

2509
02:56:10,880 --> 02:56:16,920
Semicolon is an iterative and than one
lines of queries you are writing together

2510
02:56:18,160 --> 02:56:19,040
so that your tools

2511
02:56:19,040 --> 02:56:22,800
can work correctly.

2512
02:56:22,800 --> 02:56:26,400
Is it good to

2513
02:56:26,400 --> 02:56:28,800
make it make sense?

2514
02:56:28,800 --> 02:56:31,680
All right, so I have built ambiguity.

2515
02:56:31,680 --> 02:56:34,280
So what do you suggest to add or not?

2516
02:56:34,280 --> 02:56:35,680
In here we have a single query.

2517
02:56:35,680 --> 02:56:36,720
We don't need it.

2518
02:56:36,720 --> 02:56:38,880
If you even if you edit it is fine.

2519
02:56:39,320 --> 02:56:42,120
It is fine.

2520
02:56:42,120 --> 02:56:44,280
You want to edit, you can edit no issues.

2521
02:56:45,000 --> 02:56:45,800
So which method?

2522
02:56:45,800 --> 02:56:47,640
I should call guys

2523
02:56:48,560 --> 02:56:50,360
from db utils.

2524
02:56:50,360 --> 02:56:53,840
I should call get the table data right

2525
02:56:54,400 --> 02:56:57,240
and I should pass the query in here

2526
02:56:57,840 --> 02:57:01,280
and let's let store the results

2527
02:57:01,280 --> 02:57:14,120
in global variable again.

2528
02:57:14,120 --> 02:57:18,280
And because we don't have this variable,
yes, we will be getting an error.

2529
02:57:18,280 --> 02:57:24,240
So let's this field in here
and the type of the field

2530
02:57:24,240 --> 02:57:27,280
should be list of maps
and what the things should

2531
02:57:27,280 --> 02:57:30,560
be asking.

2532
02:57:30,560 --> 02:57:32,040
All good guys here

2533
02:57:37,200 --> 02:58:28,680
for you.

2534
02:58:28,680 --> 02:58:31,200
And I see query database.

2535
02:58:32,280 --> 02:58:33,400
You have to

2536
02:58:37,040 --> 02:58:38,720
this one right

2537
02:58:46,240 --> 02:58:47,840
if you

2538
02:59:29,640 --> 02:59:31,680
and you explain line well please

2539
02:59:32,960 --> 02:59:34,800
so in here of this

2540
02:59:34,800 --> 02:59:39,080
DB utils is a class it has a static method

2541
02:59:39,080 --> 02:59:41,560
I am calling it with only the class name

2542
02:59:42,240 --> 02:59:45,000
and I am passing the duty to this method.

2543
02:59:45,000 --> 02:59:48,840
This method takes security
and returns us a list of maps

2544
02:59:49,280 --> 02:59:53,480
that contains the data against that
good in show global place here.

2545
02:59:53,480 --> 02:59:55,000
Sure. This.

2546
02:59:55,000 --> 02:59:57,960
This is the global.

2547
02:59:57,960 --> 02:59:58,840
It's fine guys.

2548
02:59:58,840 --> 03:00:14,600
If you guys have more questions,
please ask.

2549
03:00:14,600 --> 03:00:18,320
Did you guys realize how these six months
passed?

2550
03:00:18,320 --> 03:00:19,320
So quickly?

2551
03:00:19,320 --> 03:00:22,120
It's just two more weeks

2552
03:00:30,320 --> 03:00:31,480
too quick.

2553
03:00:31,480 --> 03:00:33,800
I know. So scary.

2554
03:00:33,800 --> 03:00:40,880
Please don't start.

2555
03:00:40,880 --> 03:00:57,160
I think it is time
you guys should start revising things.

2556
03:00:57,160 --> 03:00:59,160
I don't believe it is two weeks only.

2557
03:00:59,960 --> 03:01:02,160
First,
I don't believe it is two weeks only.

2558
03:01:02,160 --> 03:01:10,120
So mandatory part is only two weeks
remaining is optional.

2559
03:01:10,120 --> 03:01:16,560
You can start applying after two weeks.

2560
03:01:16,560 --> 03:01:18,640
Can I see the Q2 database please?

2561
03:01:18,680 --> 03:01:24,280
Here, Raghu, please.

2562
03:01:24,280 --> 03:01:36,240
Yes, we will have sessions
for back as well.

2563
03:01:36,240 --> 03:01:38,280
But first we have to pass all them.

2564
03:01:38,280 --> 03:01:40,160
All contribute, right? Yes. Clicking?

2565
03:01:40,160 --> 03:01:45,400
Yes. And second,
still thinking in our brains

2566
03:01:46,960 --> 03:01:49,600
that I know for sure, but

2567
03:01:51,240 --> 03:01:53,640
oh no, you guys are all really.

2568
03:01:53,640 --> 03:02:11,040
You have to learn
so many things in interview as well.

2569
03:02:11,040 --> 03:02:13,680
Is there anyone who is still lagging
behind

2570
03:02:15,720 --> 03:02:17,600
third guys try to shake your hand.

2571
03:02:17,600 --> 03:02:20,200
Do you feel some java in there?

2572
03:02:20,200 --> 03:02:24,880
How just kind of just confirming
to get updated with

2573
03:02:24,880 --> 03:02:28,840
get quickly all we have to do is press
on which arrow exactly and I will

2574
03:02:28,880 --> 03:02:31,000
this one and this blue one

2575
03:02:31,240 --> 03:02:36,360
update project is update project.

2576
03:02:36,360 --> 03:02:37,920
We will take more interviews.

2577
03:02:37,920 --> 03:02:41,160
Your seniors
most probably students from Batch nine

2578
03:02:45,280 --> 03:02:48,440
because their Yes, yes,

2579
03:02:48,960 --> 03:02:51,720
yes they have already filled
ten interviews.

2580
03:02:52,320 --> 03:02:55,320
We will be teaching interview
prep class and Java.

2581
03:02:55,320 --> 03:02:56,520
Ask you Will Jenkins.

2582
03:02:56,520 --> 03:03:00,400
I will teach API most probably so Hal

2583
03:03:00,560 --> 03:03:04,600
cucumber test and most ASL and wisdom.

2584
03:03:04,960 --> 03:03:10,440
We get Amazon
and we have another instructor who will

2585
03:03:10,600 --> 03:03:14,080
teach how to how to dress,

2586
03:03:14,760 --> 03:03:18,600
what perfumes,
to use of audio, online interviews

2587
03:03:18,680 --> 03:03:23,040
with what jewelry to wear, literally.

2588
03:03:23,480 --> 03:03:27,680
I mean, it's not because as the other side
cannot feel it,

2589
03:03:27,680 --> 03:03:31,680
but it is for you guys, the perfumes,
they make you feel

2590
03:03:32,280 --> 03:03:35,320
they can change your mood,
the jewelry, the

2591
03:03:36,120 --> 03:03:39,240
the dresses that you wear,
they give you confidence.

2592
03:03:39,800 --> 03:03:41,160
So he has a Ph.D.

2593
03:03:41,160 --> 03:03:43,440
in Social or something like that.

2594
03:03:43,920 --> 03:03:46,680
So he will teach you all of this stuff.

2595
03:03:47,160 --> 03:03:48,960
And believe me, it effects it.

2596
03:03:48,960 --> 03:03:51,720
It effects.

2597
03:03:51,720 --> 03:03:56,440
I don't want you to give the interviews
in your pajamas sitting in front of

2598
03:03:56,440 --> 03:04:01,080
just laptops all by God, we haven't really
let's have a call for that.

2599
03:04:01,080 --> 03:04:05,280
So we want to have you mentally ready
for like, for example,

2600
03:04:05,280 --> 03:04:08,280
if you are sitting in front of it,
in front of maybe

2601
03:04:08,280 --> 03:04:14,000
two or three persons for in your real life
interviews making out in Nice,

2602
03:04:14,000 --> 03:04:16,920
what I never hear,
the interviewer would not see

2603
03:04:17,760 --> 03:04:21,400
but and you will feel it.

2604
03:04:21,400 --> 03:04:22,640
You will feel it.

2605
03:04:22,640 --> 03:04:25,360
No, but seriously,
when you are online, we need perfume.

2606
03:04:26,600 --> 03:04:27,760
When When

2607
03:04:27,760 --> 03:04:31,400
we are online, we need perfume. Yes.

2608
03:04:31,520 --> 03:04:34,320
So that you don't get killed
by your own smell.

2609
03:04:34,320 --> 03:04:36,920
You know. Nice.

2610
03:04:36,920 --> 03:04:40,400
But you never feel

2611
03:04:42,720 --> 03:04:43,200
it's.

2612
03:04:45,120 --> 03:04:49,880
I mean, it is also possible to write it

2613
03:04:51,360 --> 03:04:52,080
with level.

2614
03:04:52,080 --> 03:04:54,760
We will have after course,
in the middle of

2615
03:04:55,280 --> 03:04:57,600
you will be having
five years of experience

2616
03:04:58,560 --> 03:04:59,440
after

2617
03:05:01,200 --> 03:05:01,760
Simon.

2618
03:05:01,760 --> 03:05:02,840
You are right. Why?

2619
03:05:02,840 --> 03:05:05,320
I never read

2620
03:05:08,480 --> 03:05:09,600
so 30 guys.

2621
03:05:09,600 --> 03:05:11,920
I cannot control myself.

2622
03:05:11,920 --> 03:05:15,600
My thought is never feel
as good as they look.

2623
03:05:15,600 --> 03:05:17,040
I can tell about my galaxy.

2624
03:05:17,040 --> 03:05:21,960
Watch It looks and feels good.

2625
03:05:21,960 --> 03:05:24,240
Is it middle or zero zero? Fred?

2626
03:05:24,280 --> 03:05:28,960
Why are you guys ready?

2627
03:05:28,960 --> 03:05:31,480
We have to do some

2628
03:05:38,200 --> 03:05:38,720
like we are

2629
03:05:38,720 --> 03:05:43,080
all with five years of experience.

2630
03:05:43,080 --> 03:05:44,400
Mine is an old Omega.

2631
03:05:44,400 --> 03:05:47,520
Yes. My God. They also have good watches

2632
03:05:48,520 --> 03:05:49,840
for silly guys.

2633
03:05:49,840 --> 03:05:52,240
They also have good.

2634
03:05:52,240 --> 03:05:53,160
Okay,

2635
03:05:54,240 --> 03:05:57,920
so is there anyone
who don't understand this line? 12.

2636
03:05:58,280 --> 03:06:00,960
So until this point, we have successfully

2637
03:06:01,000 --> 03:06:03,400
captured idea of the employee.

2638
03:06:04,680 --> 03:06:06,360
That's why you are not wearing them.

2639
03:06:06,360 --> 03:06:07,680
Oh, I have actually started it.

2640
03:06:07,680 --> 03:06:08,840
It is starting.

2641
03:06:08,840 --> 03:06:12,400
So that's why I just placed it
on the on the charger.

2642
03:06:12,440 --> 03:06:15,560
Otherwise I was wearing
when I started the class

2643
03:06:17,960 --> 03:06:21,440
here that told us.

2644
03:06:22,000 --> 03:06:25,000
So we have successfully captured

2645
03:06:25,000 --> 03:06:27,800
the ID, constructed the query

2646
03:06:28,320 --> 03:06:33,400
and then passed that query
to the get table data method

2647
03:06:33,600 --> 03:06:37,320
and it will give us a list of map
that will contain the data.

2648
03:06:38,520 --> 03:06:41,040
So there is one more step

2649
03:06:41,040 --> 03:06:43,080
that we have to implement

2650
03:06:46,920 --> 03:06:49,680
and that is the result verified.

2651
03:06:49,680 --> 03:06:52,360
The results have been here

2652
03:06:53,440 --> 03:07:04,880
and so

2653
03:07:05,480 --> 03:07:11,720
let's pick in.

2654
03:07:11,720 --> 03:07:14,120
So guys, I have the

2655
03:07:16,920 --> 03:07:19,320
first name inside

2656
03:07:20,040 --> 03:07:30,760
global variables dot first name right?

2657
03:07:30,760 --> 03:07:35,920
And the first name
that we are getting from the DB.

2658
03:07:37,320 --> 03:07:37,640
Okay.

2659
03:07:37,640 --> 03:07:40,280
Lurking indicator variable

2660
03:07:40,640 --> 03:07:43,560
string of first name.

2661
03:07:43,960 --> 03:07:44,560
Okay.

2662
03:07:44,600 --> 03:07:47,960
From DB,

2663
03:07:47,960 --> 03:07:50,200
so how we can get it

2664
03:07:50,520 --> 03:07:55,200
have already stored that list of maps
inside the global variables.

2665
03:07:55,200 --> 03:07:56,080
Right?

2666
03:07:56,680 --> 03:08:00,920
So global variables dart table data.

2667
03:08:01,440 --> 03:08:05,720
So this table data
contains a list of maps.

2668
03:08:05,840 --> 03:08:10,200
So first I need to fetch
the first index on the list.

2669
03:08:10,720 --> 03:08:12,880
How can I get the

2670
03:08:13,200 --> 03:08:17,280
element at a specific index
if I am inside,

2671
03:08:17,320 --> 03:08:20,400
if I am using a list right

2672
03:08:22,920 --> 03:08:26,480
by get method right, how many rows

2673
03:08:26,480 --> 03:08:41,760
we will be getting as a result
of this query?

2674
03:08:41,760 --> 03:08:42,800
One. Right.

2675
03:08:42,800 --> 03:08:46,800
And at which index that row will be placed

2676
03:08:46,800 --> 03:08:53,160
inside this list of maps.

2677
03:08:53,160 --> 03:08:54,440
Zero. Right.

2678
03:08:54,440 --> 03:08:58,120
Once I have accessed the element
that index number zero.

2679
03:08:58,120 --> 03:09:04,640
What will
what type of element it will be guides.

2680
03:09:04,640 --> 03:09:08,160
What does this list contain?

2681
03:09:08,160 --> 03:09:09,880
No, no, no. What does this list contain?

2682
03:09:10,920 --> 03:09:13,000
It does not contain strings directly.

2683
03:09:13,000 --> 03:09:15,480
It contains maps.

2684
03:09:15,480 --> 03:09:21,120
And from map
I can get data by by passing the key.

2685
03:09:21,120 --> 03:09:21,960
Right.

2686
03:09:22,920 --> 03:09:27,360
What will be the key for the first name?

2687
03:09:27,360 --> 03:09:39,440
What will be the key for the first name?

2688
03:09:39,440 --> 03:09:46,920
MP Underscore First name
or only the first name?

2689
03:09:46,920 --> 03:09:50,720
MP First name right.

2690
03:09:50,720 --> 03:09:55,560
Because remember we wrote a genetic code
that fetches all the columns

2691
03:09:56,160 --> 03:09:59,040
and for each column
then it fetches all the names, right?

2692
03:09:59,040 --> 03:10:07,000
So MP first name.

2693
03:10:07,000 --> 03:10:12,640
So if I pass this MP first name in here,

2694
03:10:12,640 --> 03:10:16,680
this, this is the first name
that I am getting from the database.

2695
03:10:16,680 --> 03:10:18,400
Everyone understand this.

2696
03:10:18,400 --> 03:10:26,760
This is the first name that I am getting
from the database, right?

2697
03:10:27,120 --> 03:10:29,720
So let me write

2698
03:10:31,080 --> 03:10:34,040
the first name from

2699
03:10:34,040 --> 03:10:34,800
that obvious

2700
03:10:35,920 --> 03:10:38,880
plus first name

2701
03:10:39,520 --> 03:10:44,240
and where we have stored
the first name that we got from the Dubai.

2702
03:10:44,360 --> 03:10:50,360
Do you guys remember?

2703
03:10:50,360 --> 03:10:53,240
Where did we store
the first name that we got from the UAE?

2704
03:10:53,640 --> 03:10:55,080
Let me show it again.

2705
03:10:55,080 --> 03:10:58,040
We implemented a step

2706
03:11:00,520 --> 03:11:02,680
capture, employ I.D., Right.

2707
03:11:03,280 --> 03:11:05,280
We capture the employee I.D.

2708
03:11:05,280 --> 03:11:08,000
and also the first name that we enter.

2709
03:11:08,040 --> 03:11:09,080
Where do we put it?

2710
03:11:09,080 --> 03:11:12,120
We store it inside
the global variables dot first name

2711
03:11:12,120 --> 03:11:18,480
right face.

2712
03:11:18,480 --> 03:11:22,200
So this is the first name
that we are getting from the Dubai

2713
03:11:22,200 --> 03:11:47,760
right.

2714
03:11:47,760 --> 03:11:49,440
And then

2715
03:11:50,560 --> 03:11:51,960
just print out

2716
03:11:51,960 --> 03:11:54,960
this information
and let's see what information we get.

2717
03:11:54,960 --> 03:11:59,040
Let's because we have written so much code
and we have not tested

2718
03:11:59,040 --> 03:12:02,840
all of these methods, so there are chances
that there might be problems.

2719
03:12:03,240 --> 03:12:06,480
So let's first
print out the things and let's verify

2720
03:12:06,480 --> 03:12:15,400
if everything is fine or not.

2721
03:12:15,400 --> 03:12:20,880
So how can I
how can I execute this test do what is

2722
03:12:21,040 --> 03:12:25,960
why is it that the interface
has a graphical user interface UI or the

2723
03:12:26,960 --> 03:12:29,720
user interface or the.

2724
03:12:29,720 --> 03:12:31,560
So we should go to do it on our class.

2725
03:12:31,560 --> 03:12:34,240
So we change changed
the runner class right already.

2726
03:12:34,240 --> 03:12:37,360
And then we simply need
to execute this class.

2727
03:12:38,040 --> 03:12:42,240
So everyone close your eyes,
have your hand on your heart

2728
03:12:42,600 --> 03:12:47,960
and close your doors and windows
and stop your breath for a second.

2729
03:12:48,400 --> 03:12:51,840
And pray together that it works

2730
03:12:51,840 --> 03:12:56,240
fine.

2731
03:12:56,240 --> 03:12:56,960
It works.

2732
03:12:56,960 --> 03:12:59,120
You have already done it

2733
03:13:00,000 --> 03:13:02,560
or it should be false.

2734
03:13:02,680 --> 03:13:04,440
Sorry. False.

2735
03:13:05,160 --> 03:13:08,400
Actually false.

2736
03:13:08,400 --> 03:13:09,320
Did you change or not?

2737
03:13:09,320 --> 03:13:11,520
I have just seen

2738
03:13:13,720 --> 03:13:17,320
at least I am on the wall

2739
03:13:17,800 --> 03:13:28,160
so it has opened the browser.

2740
03:13:28,160 --> 03:13:33,400
Are you guys also running with me?

2741
03:13:33,400 --> 03:13:35,360
Everyone is running.

2742
03:13:35,360 --> 03:13:40,040
Can you guys please stop for a moment
so that we at least know if it

2743
03:13:40,800 --> 03:13:45,520
if whatever
we have to do today to get there?

2744
03:13:46,920 --> 03:13:47,640
It looks

2745
03:13:47,640 --> 03:14:04,960
good.

2746
03:14:04,960 --> 03:14:05,480
It entered.

2747
03:14:05,480 --> 03:14:08,400
I think I missed something
since I got an error on the last step.

2748
03:14:08,440 --> 03:14:11,640
My utils or the global variable is null
so I missed something

2749
03:14:12,720 --> 03:14:14,560
but we will find out.

2750
03:14:14,560 --> 03:14:17,800
Don't worry and we will find out

2751
03:14:18,200 --> 03:14:19,520
if we are getting it.

2752
03:14:19,520 --> 03:14:22,400
There might be some issues

2753
03:14:33,840 --> 03:14:35,880
related to saving.

2754
03:14:37,040 --> 03:14:40,320
Stephen is not allowed with all the sorry,

2755
03:14:40,480 --> 03:14:48,840
we have to change it for something else.

2756
03:14:48,840 --> 03:14:50,880
Sorry on the

2757
03:14:51,960 --> 03:14:54,680
you cannot wait to get that

2758
03:14:54,800 --> 03:15:01,160
blah blah.

2759
03:15:01,160 --> 03:15:04,600
I have you guys also use the same
same name that I am using in here.

2760
03:15:04,600 --> 03:15:09,320
Maybe every one of you
have you guys use the same save names.

2761
03:15:09,320 --> 03:15:11,080
Please don't copy everything.

2762
03:15:11,080 --> 03:15:13,440
Please don't copy everything.

2763
03:15:14,880 --> 03:15:16,920
You that lists make some changes

2764
03:15:24,280 --> 03:15:27,160
that we're going to be
again this time please vote.

2765
03:15:28,920 --> 03:15:30,280
So it might be my fault

2766
03:15:30,280 --> 03:15:34,880
yours is nursing.

2767
03:15:36,240 --> 03:15:39,520
Actually, this website has already
also have a lot of bugs.

2768
03:15:40,360 --> 03:15:42,360
Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

2769
03:15:42,360 --> 03:15:58,480
You guys know better than me.

2770
03:15:58,480 --> 03:16:00,040
And yes, it was.

2771
03:16:00,040 --> 03:16:02,240
It was the name that caused the problem.

2772
03:16:03,240 --> 03:16:05,280
Employ saved successfully

2773
03:16:06,760 --> 03:16:08,960
and let's see what we have planned.

2774
03:16:10,680 --> 03:16:12,880
So when user

2775
03:16:12,880 --> 03:16:17,000
enters blah blah blah blah blah blah,
no suitable

2776
03:16:17,520 --> 03:16:19,920
found for the day and the dependencies

2777
03:16:22,440 --> 03:16:24,600
formed or tags email.

2778
03:16:24,600 --> 03:16:28,280
And I want to make sure that I reload

2779
03:16:28,320 --> 03:16:29,560
the front of the

2780
03:16:32,920 --> 03:16:36,120
i also guys if you are getting

2781
03:16:36,440 --> 03:16:41,160
even if after using the older word,
then if you are the error you can

2782
03:16:42,560 --> 03:16:45,360
invalidate invalidate your cache as well.

2783
03:16:45,360 --> 03:16:46,640
From here

2784
03:16:48,960 --> 03:16:51,120
and you can restart your intelligence

2785
03:16:51,120 --> 03:16:54,400
so that it builds everything

2786
03:16:54,400 --> 03:17:01,640
from scratch.

2787
03:17:01,640 --> 03:17:19,480
So many tests are working
with this website and it still has bugs.

2788
03:17:19,480 --> 03:17:22,360
Wait for it to index the file.
It might take some time,

2789
03:17:23,480 --> 03:17:25,560
not even to do it and not enough
developers.

2790
03:17:25,560 --> 03:17:33,360
Is there anyone who has also
got this skill?

2791
03:17:33,360 --> 03:17:35,640
Can you show how you did it?

2792
03:17:36,000 --> 03:17:38,280
The invalidate thing it is file

2793
03:17:39,360 --> 03:17:43,080
and then invalidate caching me error.

2794
03:17:43,080 --> 03:17:44,040
Sure.

2795
03:17:44,040 --> 03:17:52,040
Me same.

2796
03:17:52,040 --> 03:17:53,080
Let's wait it for.

2797
03:17:53,080 --> 03:17:56,880
Although being as this is a class
for testers, one could argue

2798
03:17:57,120 --> 03:18:00,720
all bugs on the outside
are not in fact bugs, they are features.

2799
03:18:01,800 --> 03:18:04,200
Was it helpful?

2800
03:18:04,200 --> 03:18:07,440
What then is it?

2801
03:18:07,440 --> 03:18:08,520
Is it still indexing?

2802
03:18:08,520 --> 03:18:11,600
Next, let's see if it was helpful and

2803
03:18:15,480 --> 03:18:18,240
so you guys should see
a progress board in here

2804
03:18:18,240 --> 03:18:24,240
that is indexing.

2805
03:18:24,240 --> 03:18:29,160
Maybe if someone is using a core
I9 or a good laptop, maybe

2806
03:18:29,160 --> 03:18:32,320
the indexing is already done for them
and you guys,

2807
03:18:32,320 --> 03:18:39,600
it is working now.

2808
03:18:39,600 --> 03:18:40,720
And one Mac Yep.

2809
03:18:40,720 --> 03:18:42,960
They are faster, they are faster.

2810
03:18:44,280 --> 03:18:45,320
Still running,

2811
03:18:45,320 --> 03:18:49,080
not working.

2812
03:18:49,080 --> 03:18:59,680
We have millions of projects.

2813
03:18:59,680 --> 03:19:02,560
Look at next to you.

2814
03:19:02,760 --> 03:19:04,360
What did you change for?

2815
03:19:04,360 --> 03:19:07,840
No suitable driver
I have just invalidated the cache.

2816
03:19:08,000 --> 03:19:34,240
Maybe we might need
to change the connector. Got.

2817
03:19:34,240 --> 03:19:47,040
Then we might need to change
the building out in here.

2818
03:19:47,040 --> 03:19:53,400
We did.

2819
03:19:53,400 --> 03:19:56,160
I ran it and it also got that problem

2820
03:19:58,800 --> 03:20:00,480
embedding

2821
03:20:00,480 --> 03:20:08,160
null pointer exception.

2822
03:20:08,160 --> 03:20:16,160
Then it's going to show me
the start of the error.

2823
03:20:16,160 --> 03:20:17,040
NULL pointer is fine.

2824
03:20:17,040 --> 03:20:30,000
We can fix that.

2825
03:20:30,000 --> 03:20:31,240
Let me check. Why? Why?

2826
03:20:31,240 --> 03:20:33,880
Because we want us to say goodbye.

2827
03:20:33,880 --> 03:20:36,520
See my as

2828
03:20:37,160 --> 03:20:37,920
we are

2829
03:20:56,640 --> 03:21:00,520
use the same string

2830
03:21:07,000 --> 03:21:07,360
guys.

2831
03:21:07,360 --> 03:21:09,480
Give me what I think right
now. Understood.

2832
03:21:10,280 --> 03:21:13,800
We need to remove this double course
because it is taking

2833
03:21:13,840 --> 03:21:16,440
this whole string

2834
03:21:17,040 --> 03:21:17,760
like this.

2835
03:21:19,000 --> 03:21:19,720
Nice.

2836
03:21:19,920 --> 03:21:22,440
Go inside your config file

2837
03:21:24,360 --> 03:21:26,720
and remove those double code in here.

2838
03:21:28,080 --> 03:21:32,040
We will fix the null point, but not very.

2839
03:21:32,040 --> 03:21:34,840
We will fix not find that

2840
03:21:36,960 --> 03:21:39,000
notebook and not invoke java list.

2841
03:21:39,000 --> 03:21:41,960
Dart into that because that isn't

2842
03:21:43,320 --> 03:21:45,160
for the username to do.

2843
03:21:45,160 --> 03:21:52,520
We have all the
we also have double course for username.

2844
03:21:52,520 --> 03:21:54,560
Oh yes, yes.

2845
03:21:54,560 --> 03:21:55,880
Yes. You are right.

2846
03:21:55,880 --> 03:21:58,160
We should also with

2847
03:21:58,360 --> 03:22:00,280
this is going to stick

2848
03:22:02,040 --> 03:22:04,040
now we will get another data

2849
03:22:04,040 --> 03:22:16,920
for not entering the property
username and password.

2850
03:22:16,920 --> 03:22:19,840
Okay. Now look

2851
03:22:20,320 --> 03:22:21,880
remove semicolon.

2852
03:22:21,880 --> 03:22:24,840
Yes, I have a little bit, but

2853
03:22:29,720 --> 03:22:31,000
what about semicolon. Yes.

2854
03:22:31,000 --> 03:22:34,800
Remove access denied
because there were double faults

2855
03:22:34,800 --> 03:22:37,600
with the username as well

2856
03:23:00,400 --> 03:23:03,040
as is.

2857
03:23:03,280 --> 03:23:03,840
Great.

2858
03:23:03,840 --> 03:23:06,320
Great. Great.

2859
03:23:06,320 --> 03:23:12,400
Let me also check it on my end.

2860
03:23:12,400 --> 03:23:13,640
Works now.

2861
03:23:13,640 --> 03:23:15,760
Oh but still right.

2862
03:23:15,760 --> 03:23:17,840
It didn't work in the first go.

2863
03:23:18,080 --> 03:23:21,360
It always happened
like no matter how many years

2864
03:23:21,360 --> 03:23:24,840
you have been coding
and if you have written so much code

2865
03:23:24,840 --> 03:23:30,000
and if you run, you at least
at least one after.

2866
03:23:30,000 --> 03:23:32,400
If it happened only once.

2867
03:23:32,400 --> 03:23:36,720
I wrote so much code and it all worked
perfectly fine, but only one

2868
03:23:45,080 --> 03:23:46,040
works fine.

2869
03:23:46,040 --> 03:23:49,000
So slow means

2870
03:23:50,120 --> 03:23:51,360
try removing this all

2871
03:23:51,360 --> 03:23:54,520
the maybe it will become faster

2872
03:23:54,520 --> 03:23:56,640
or you guys now have added blah blah

2873
03:23:56,640 --> 03:23:59,760
as well.

2874
03:23:59,760 --> 03:24:03,360
Who has edited this blah blah now.

2875
03:24:03,360 --> 03:24:08,840
Okay guys, you will never let my desk

2876
03:24:09,000 --> 03:24:22,360
pass right?

2877
03:24:22,360 --> 03:24:28,200
Don't you get answers to.

2878
03:24:28,200 --> 03:24:30,240
I know. Then is it? Is you right?

2879
03:24:31,040 --> 03:24:33,440
Let me be quicker than you.

2880
03:24:34,560 --> 03:24:37,320
Hopefully
my entry will be passed to study it.

2881
03:24:38,640 --> 03:24:39,720
No way.

2882
03:24:40,680 --> 03:24:43,120
I I will.

2883
03:24:43,120 --> 03:24:46,960
If it still does not work,
I will move it to a different screen.

2884
03:24:46,960 --> 03:24:51,600
I will enter something different
and then I will bring that.

2885
03:24:54,200 --> 03:24:56,520
So you see Usman

2886
03:24:56,520 --> 03:24:57,720
in here?

2887
03:24:58,360 --> 03:25:00,520
Mine must be one oligarchic.

2888
03:25:00,520 --> 03:25:04,880
KING Okay, of

2889
03:25:05,920 --> 03:25:07,600
this time it passes.

2890
03:25:07,600 --> 03:25:10,640
So that

2891
03:25:12,120 --> 03:25:15,600
the employ it was going to be 500, right?

2892
03:25:16,120 --> 03:25:18,360
The first name was blah.

2893
03:25:18,360 --> 03:25:21,480
This is the information that we
entered from the front back,

2894
03:25:23,120 --> 03:25:26,520
and then we perform the

2895
03:25:27,000 --> 03:25:28,960
captured employer I.D.

2896
03:25:28,960 --> 03:25:32,520
then save the employer successfully added

2897
03:25:33,120 --> 03:25:35,600
the security information from back

2898
03:25:35,600 --> 03:25:38,360
and the first name from database is bla

2899
03:25:39,480 --> 03:25:42,000
first name from July is also blah.

2900
03:25:42,960 --> 03:25:45,280
Then verify the results from
you are going back

2901
03:25:45,280 --> 03:25:49,840
end so we only need this simple part

2902
03:25:51,520 --> 03:25:54,000
in which we need to write the assertion.

2903
03:25:54,000 --> 03:25:54,640
Right.

2904
03:25:55,360 --> 03:25:56,640
But how do we write it?

2905
03:25:56,640 --> 03:26:05,360
Alert's equal.

2906
03:26:05,360 --> 03:26:07,400
Am I missing some kind of

2907
03:26:08,880 --> 03:26:09,560
alerts.

2908
03:26:09,560 --> 03:26:11,400
Well, this one right?

2909
03:26:11,400 --> 03:26:14,440
And we boss the expected

2910
03:26:14,920 --> 03:26:20,920
and the actual results
are so firstname from baby.

2911
03:26:20,920 --> 03:26:24,240
And then the first name from the guy

2912
03:26:29,160 --> 03:26:30,720
looks work, right?

2913
03:26:30,720 --> 03:26:31,880
Gestures.

2914
03:26:32,120 --> 03:26:34,240
Is there anything that you guys
want to document

2915
03:26:36,080 --> 03:26:39,600
or you want to add something you can

2916
03:26:39,600 --> 03:26:43,640
and now you can remove these print out
statements if it is working, fine.

2917
03:26:44,120 --> 03:26:48,760
But I think it will be good
if instead of removing, we can come out

2918
03:26:49,800 --> 03:26:51,560
show your db utils please.

2919
03:26:51,560 --> 03:26:54,840
Yes. Now let's resolve all of your issues
first, the issues

2920
03:26:54,840 --> 03:26:57,120
that you guys are getting
and then we will run together

2921
03:26:59,000 --> 03:27:01,080
the b utils.

2922
03:27:01,080 --> 03:27:06,520
Here we have the debut documents
and let me also push this to Bertram.

2923
03:27:07,560 --> 03:27:09,080
Just just one

2924
03:27:12,320 --> 03:27:15,240
and be the first thing.

2925
03:27:16,000 --> 03:27:16,640
Dude,

2926
03:27:18,240 --> 03:27:19,760
what does this error means?

2927
03:27:19,760 --> 03:27:23,560
Which error invoke
java list door to get to because

2928
03:27:23,560 --> 03:27:26,960
utils or two global variables
that our table is null,

2929
03:27:27,360 --> 03:27:30,920
you'll get that you are doing
some mistake in your query be met.

2930
03:27:30,920 --> 03:27:34,920
Third to get a table
that is returning you in null value.

2931
03:27:36,160 --> 03:27:38,040
So there is something terrible

2932
03:27:38,040 --> 03:27:41,080
going wrong inside your get table method.

2933
03:27:41,080 --> 03:27:43,920
Do you want the method from me?

2934
03:27:44,120 --> 03:27:47,720
The print out straight
only the print statement statements.

2935
03:27:49,560 --> 03:27:50,840
Let me you mind.

2936
03:27:50,840 --> 03:27:55,080
Maybe you can.

2937
03:27:55,080 --> 03:28:03,040
And I think you would also be needing
these matters.

2938
03:28:03,040 --> 03:28:06,600
And I have guys
I have already pushed the code to the

2939
03:28:07,160 --> 03:28:10,080
YouTube as well as version pass.

2940
03:28:10,120 --> 03:28:11,520
Yes, it should pass.

2941
03:28:11,520 --> 03:28:14,160
We will also execute it. So

2942
03:28:15,240 --> 03:28:18,520
you guys want to have a look at the
this is the db utils

2943
03:28:18,600 --> 03:28:24,760
then if you want to have a look in here.

2944
03:28:24,760 --> 03:28:26,080
Uh, yes.

2945
03:28:26,080 --> 03:28:28,720
The sequence is important for us to leap.

2946
03:28:28,720 --> 03:28:31,080
First we should pass the WRAL,

2947
03:28:31,080 --> 03:28:33,800
then the DB username
and then the DB password.

2948
03:28:34,200 --> 03:28:42,240
The sequence is important.

2949
03:28:42,240 --> 03:28:44,880
Mustafa, you, you have written. Thank you.

2950
03:28:45,120 --> 03:28:46,440
I'm done. I don't know.

2951
03:28:46,440 --> 03:28:48,560
Is it in Afghani?

2952
03:28:49,240 --> 03:28:51,440
What does it mean by done?

2953
03:28:51,440 --> 03:28:53,880
I mean, if you call in Lady John in here

2954
03:28:53,880 --> 03:28:57,080
in Pakistan,
she will beat the hell out of you.

2955
03:28:58,040 --> 03:28:59,880
Yes, G

2956
03:29:02,760 --> 03:29:04,920
John means like

2957
03:29:06,760 --> 03:29:09,680
it's like, like, like you are calling it.

2958
03:29:10,040 --> 03:29:14,160
It's something, for example,
it has a very bad meaning in it.

2959
03:29:15,240 --> 03:29:15,920
Yes dear.

2960
03:29:15,920 --> 03:29:19,320
In but in local in here they call John

2961
03:29:19,320 --> 03:29:22,520
someone like for example
whom you love very much.

2962
03:29:22,520 --> 03:29:26,480
And you want to
you want her to be your wife or something.

2963
03:29:26,480 --> 03:29:29,200
Very, very close in here.

2964
03:29:29,200 --> 03:29:38,120
This is what it means in here.

2965
03:29:38,120 --> 03:29:40,840
Same in my country. Yes.

2966
03:29:40,840 --> 03:29:41,920
In India as well.

2967
03:29:41,920 --> 03:29:45,320
In India
as when you don't accidentally call

2968
03:29:45,320 --> 03:29:48,280
someone done it

2969
03:29:51,240 --> 03:29:52,920
in Turkish as well.

2970
03:29:52,920 --> 03:29:59,080
Yep. Every name has done
after the name hon.

2971
03:29:59,080 --> 03:29:59,720
And John.

2972
03:29:59,720 --> 03:30:02,360
Okay.

2973
03:30:02,360 --> 03:30:04,560
In my country they call everyone John.

2974
03:30:05,000 --> 03:30:05,720
Thank

2975
03:30:06,800 --> 03:30:07,320
everyone.

2976
03:30:07,320 --> 03:30:10,960
John But there is also John studies
also. John

2977
03:30:13,400 --> 03:30:15,360
and Bill is also done do though.

2978
03:30:15,360 --> 03:30:21,840
So John, what does it mean in John
and not in your country?

2979
03:30:21,840 --> 03:30:25,760
B Oh yes, the literal meanings
they are here,

2980
03:30:26,360 --> 03:30:32,160
but the actual meanings are very,
very different here saying

2981
03:30:33,280 --> 03:30:38,160
or is there anyone who is getting issues,

2982
03:30:38,160 --> 03:30:43,320
errors, unable
to get the results, getting no values?

2983
03:30:44,400 --> 03:30:46,000
Yes, same in Farsi.

2984
03:30:46,000 --> 03:30:48,120
You did life, love and

2985
03:30:50,920 --> 03:30:53,080
add steps dot add employ

2986
03:30:53,120 --> 03:30:55,280
steps verify result from db

2987
03:30:57,720 --> 03:30:58,120
logo.

2988
03:30:58,120 --> 03:31:00,360
Share a complete screenshot of the error

2989
03:31:00,360 --> 03:31:03,560
some of you can post in this portal
and some of you can share in here.

2990
03:31:04,760 --> 03:31:08,640
Yes, you want to see the steps which

2991
03:31:10,880 --> 03:31:13,480
the steps to verify the

2992
03:31:17,240 --> 03:31:18,720
we need there to be.

2993
03:31:18,720 --> 03:31:21,120
We we need to do this one

2994
03:31:25,040 --> 03:31:25,520
alone.

2995
03:31:25,520 --> 03:31:28,080
We were using double codes with

2996
03:31:29,280 --> 03:31:33,440
the individual and a semicolon
also with user name and password.

2997
03:31:33,440 --> 03:31:39,960
So we removed those. Yes.

2998
03:31:39,960 --> 03:31:43,680
Because in in config files
we don't use double codes for screens.

2999
03:31:43,680 --> 03:31:45,960
It is automatically treated at this time.

3000
03:31:46,440 --> 03:31:49,240
What was the purpose in this case
we talking different

3001
03:31:49,240 --> 03:31:52,360
we took a different result
from front and back

3002
03:31:52,360 --> 03:31:56,560
and so the purpose was for
but sometimes what can happen is back

3003
03:31:56,560 --> 03:32:00,480
and let's say
developers can make mistake and instead of

3004
03:32:01,760 --> 03:32:03,360
starting this door

3005
03:32:03,360 --> 03:32:07,760
inside the first name column
in your database in here,

3006
03:32:08,040 --> 03:32:10,760
they can store this information
maybe in the middle name

3007
03:32:10,800 --> 03:32:13,080
or maybe in the in the last name.

3008
03:32:13,080 --> 03:32:16,880
Right in the in the logic, there can be
so many things that can go wrong

3009
03:32:17,120 --> 03:32:21,840
or it can also happen that the data is not
stored at all in the backend.

3010
03:32:22,560 --> 03:32:27,320
So we now have verified that
whatever columns we have decided

3011
03:32:27,320 --> 03:32:32,360
for these front end fields,
the data is actually getting stored

3012
03:32:32,360 --> 03:32:36,600
inside the exact same fields in the back
and the frontend.

3013
03:32:36,600 --> 03:32:39,360
One more thing, this database, and

3014
03:32:40,440 --> 03:32:42,600
it might be

3015
03:32:42,600 --> 03:32:47,640
that there might be multiple applications
that might be using this database.

3016
03:32:47,640 --> 03:32:50,040
So for example,
you guys must have noticed that

3017
03:32:50,760 --> 03:32:55,960
for the Facebook, when you use it
from your smartphone and when you use it

3018
03:32:55,960 --> 03:33:00,960
from the laptop, it always contains
the same information, right?

3019
03:33:00,960 --> 03:33:04,400
If there are no bugs,
whatever you post from your computer,

3020
03:33:04,400 --> 03:33:07,760
you should be able to see
from your smartphone and whatever

3021
03:33:07,760 --> 03:33:10,920
you do from your smartphone,
it should be in sync with your desktop.

3022
03:33:10,920 --> 03:33:15,640
So that means that app and the Facebook
page should be web application.

3023
03:33:15,640 --> 03:33:17,240
It is all synchronized.

3024
03:33:17,240 --> 03:33:19,440
They are using the same databases.

3025
03:33:19,440 --> 03:33:22,200
So these databases, your API is my next.

3026
03:33:22,200 --> 03:33:25,960
You will learn the API
if your API might be hitting databases,

3027
03:33:25,960 --> 03:33:29,640
your smartphone app, your desktop
application to your web application.

3028
03:33:30,000 --> 03:33:30,880
So we don't create

3029
03:33:30,880 --> 03:33:34,960
separate databases for that
because this database stays the same.

3030
03:33:34,960 --> 03:33:37,240
We make sure that every application,

3031
03:33:37,240 --> 03:33:41,200
wherever that application
is supposed to be data,

3032
03:33:41,520 --> 03:33:44,200
the data is actually getting stored
in those

3033
03:33:44,200 --> 03:33:48,520
columns.

3034
03:33:48,520 --> 03:33:50,400
Mahlobo is getting a lobotomy.

3035
03:33:50,400 --> 03:33:59,960
The first line of the error.

3036
03:33:59,960 --> 03:34:01,720
Then it is also getting an error

3037
03:34:02,720 --> 03:34:05,440
access denied for the user syntax.

3038
03:34:05,440 --> 03:34:06,960
No to that.

3039
03:34:06,960 --> 03:34:10,720
Remove the semicolon at the end from
if you

3040
03:34:10,840 --> 03:34:23,480
you are also doing the same mistake
in here.

3041
03:34:23,480 --> 03:34:27,400
In here in the config properties
file, remove the semicolon

3042
03:34:27,400 --> 03:34:28,400
and the double course.

3043
03:34:28,400 --> 03:34:34,480
Then if I still have this error, no
suitable driver Marina, please make sure.

3044
03:34:34,480 --> 03:34:38,800
No double course, no semicolons with DB
you are all first name

3045
03:34:38,800 --> 03:34:45,240
and last name.

3046
03:34:45,240 --> 03:34:46,640
I did

3047
03:34:47,280 --> 03:34:50,720
access denied for using password.

3048
03:34:50,720 --> 03:34:53,560
No, your password is incorrect.

3049
03:34:53,560 --> 03:34:54,960
The password that you are using.

3050
03:34:54,960 --> 03:34:56,080
Nobody is incorrect.

3051
03:34:56,080 --> 03:34:58,480
Let me. Let me show you this.

3052
03:34:58,560 --> 03:35:00,960
Maybe you are legal
guys, please use this information

3053
03:35:03,000 --> 03:35:04,240
in your config file.

3054
03:35:04,240 --> 03:35:07,680
Update the db
you are username and password with this.

3055
03:35:08,840 --> 03:35:10,880
Can you paste the code from my sequel?

3056
03:35:11,040 --> 03:35:15,600
Yes. This one?

3057
03:35:15,600 --> 03:35:18,360
Sure.

3058
03:35:18,360 --> 03:35:23,880
Welcome.

3059
03:35:23,880 --> 03:35:28,320
I got mine passed
just now after the fourth trial.

3060
03:35:29,360 --> 03:35:32,200
There it is.

3061
03:35:32,200 --> 03:35:35,680
So guys, I have
a homework for your ability to do this.

3062
03:35:36,240 --> 03:35:39,040
So I want you to add one more scenario

3063
03:35:39,600 --> 03:35:42,640
and this scenario, what I want you to do

3064
03:35:42,640 --> 03:35:46,920
may be you.

3065
03:35:47,200 --> 03:35:50,160
You guys can pretty much write
anything, enter

3066
03:35:50,160 --> 03:35:53,680
any information in the frontend,
fetch the same information

3067
03:35:53,680 --> 03:35:56,760
from the backend,
and make sure the information is same.

3068
03:35:57,720 --> 03:36:00,000
You can choose any of the scenarios.

3069
03:36:00,000 --> 03:36:02,600
It will be good
if you guys can write those scenarios

3070
03:36:02,600 --> 03:36:08,120
before the next review class
and guys also make sure

3071
03:36:08,120 --> 03:36:12,480
that you are to be review classes
because I have intentionally not covered

3072
03:36:12,760 --> 03:36:18,720
some things that might help you,
so I have only covered the basics.

3073
03:36:18,720 --> 03:36:22,040
That is enough,
but it will be better if you guys

3074
03:36:22,040 --> 03:36:26,040
can spend some time
attending the previous classes.

3075
03:36:26,600 --> 03:36:28,280
Who will teach the review?

3076
03:36:28,280 --> 03:36:30,720
You know, guys, I'm getting engaged.

3077
03:36:30,720 --> 03:36:35,880
I am a busy person for the next four days,
so I will not be available.

3078
03:36:35,880 --> 03:36:36,680
Sorry guys.

3079
03:36:38,120 --> 03:36:40,520
It's the right. Now.

3080
03:36:40,800 --> 03:36:45,760
I am supposed to take the review class,
but I am trying my best not to that.

3081
03:36:45,760 --> 03:36:50,440
So I have written a very long message
to ASL that I am not available.

3082
03:36:50,440 --> 03:36:52,800
Let's see what response we get from other

3083
03:36:55,000 --> 03:36:57,880
next review class voltage

3084
03:36:59,880 --> 03:37:00,120
guys.

3085
03:37:00,120 --> 03:37:05,440
All you have to do so many things so

3086
03:37:11,640 --> 03:37:12,720
and by the way,

3087
03:37:12,720 --> 03:37:16,320
you guys might have your review
or tomorrow on Monday.

3088
03:37:17,440 --> 03:37:21,840
And this is the advice from me
guys, please, please.

3089
03:37:23,160 --> 03:37:25,920
Soon you guys will be in your interviews.

3090
03:37:26,440 --> 03:37:29,280
And I have noticed this.

3091
03:37:29,280 --> 03:37:31,920
It happens with many student interviews.

3092
03:37:31,920 --> 03:37:36,480
They just ask them to write a simple class
and a method inside their class

3093
03:37:36,760 --> 03:37:40,800
and maybe a look at students
cannot even do this.

3094
03:37:40,800 --> 03:37:44,840
Please, please start
having some practice with your java.

3095
03:37:46,080 --> 03:37:49,480
No jobs without those Java skills.

3096
03:37:49,480 --> 03:37:51,520
If you want to be applying as a

3097
03:37:52,760 --> 03:37:56,200
automation tester, should we get
our flight tickets to Pakistan?

3098
03:37:56,520 --> 03:37:59,760
I am trying my best to get it done.

3099
03:37:59,760 --> 03:38:02,960
2224, 2022 ends.

3100
03:38:02,960 --> 03:38:05,960
I don't know. Code weird.

3101
03:38:06,200 --> 03:38:08,720
So many things that are going wrong.

3102
03:38:08,720 --> 03:38:11,840
I know maybe the world
will end by this year, so

3103
03:38:12,040 --> 03:38:16,440
I am trying my best to do it before people
get it.

3104
03:38:16,760 --> 03:38:25,200
Plus 92 more guests. Yup.

3105
03:38:25,200 --> 03:38:29,320
Wedding day is not confirmed yet.

3106
03:38:29,320 --> 03:38:31,160
Yes, you guys will be. I will postpone.

3107
03:38:31,160 --> 03:38:35,440
Get off the announcement
about the saw and heard what you said

3108
03:38:35,440 --> 03:38:40,560
and he said you are dramatic.

3109
03:38:40,560 --> 03:38:44,120
Yep. Yep. So

3110
03:38:47,240 --> 03:38:49,680
life in life is very short.

3111
03:38:49,680 --> 03:38:52,440
I think we should be staying happy.

3112
03:38:52,440 --> 03:38:54,160
I am really very.

3113
03:38:54,160 --> 03:38:56,960
It's very, very weird.
I am serious. It's very, very rare.

3114
03:38:56,960 --> 03:39:00,560
And maybe in years
I get serious for 5 to 10 minutes

3115
03:39:00,560 --> 03:39:06,720
and the next moment I start again.

3116
03:39:06,720 --> 03:39:12,080
Even though I can hardly hold my love,
even when I am somebody is dead,

3117
03:39:12,080 --> 03:39:15,720
then you know when we go on funerals
and things like that.

3118
03:39:16,040 --> 03:39:18,760
It's very, very hard for me to know.

3119
03:39:19,160 --> 03:39:27,920
Someday those people,
they will beat the hell out of me.

3120
03:39:27,920 --> 03:39:29,760
Because what you are talking your wedding.

3121
03:39:29,760 --> 03:39:31,120
Usually you

3122
03:39:35,600 --> 03:39:38,280
now you are dramatically funny
and or funny

3123
03:39:38,480 --> 03:39:40,320
and then you

3124
03:39:42,960 --> 03:39:43,800
actually you and I,

3125
03:39:43,800 --> 03:39:48,160
even if I am not making jokes,
I just look at the face of my friend.

3126
03:39:48,840 --> 03:39:51,360
And because we done so many things

3127
03:39:52,240 --> 03:39:57,840
in our childhood,
I we cannot control our love.

3128
03:39:57,840 --> 03:40:00,000
You are not allowed to go to funerals.

3129
03:40:01,920 --> 03:40:03,720
I mean, you you guys must all

3130
03:40:03,720 --> 03:40:12,000
also have those friends, right?

3131
03:40:12,000 --> 03:40:13,680
They don't even speak you.

3132
03:40:13,680 --> 03:40:17,720
You can just be with them
and you will not stop laughing

3133
03:40:19,400 --> 03:40:22,560
all bad calls.

3134
03:40:22,560 --> 03:40:27,240
I am that friend.

3135
03:40:27,240 --> 03:40:31,400
They should be printed his photo
on the funeral gates with this sign

3136
03:40:31,400 --> 03:40:33,120
not allowed

3137
03:40:35,360 --> 03:40:36,760
for me.

3138
03:40:38,720 --> 03:40:39,320
All right.

3139
03:40:39,320 --> 03:40:43,640
Please let me check
if we are missing something there.

3140
03:40:43,640 --> 03:40:56,400
You guys, my client has helpful.

3141
03:40:56,400 --> 03:40:56,720
Okay.

3142
03:40:56,720 --> 03:41:01,000
There is a YouTube series,
so you guys will not be having time

3143
03:41:01,000 --> 03:41:05,120
to go through all these
five or 3 hours videos. Ask

3144
03:41:07,040 --> 03:41:09,520
really?

3145
03:41:09,520 --> 03:41:13,360
So I want you to at least go through.

3146
03:41:14,680 --> 03:41:16,640
These are very good videos.

3147
03:41:16,640 --> 03:41:19,440
I am 5 to 6 minutes

3148
03:41:21,560 --> 03:41:24,040
and it will also teach you

3149
03:41:24,040 --> 03:41:29,040
how to actually install the database
on your computer starting from scratch.

3150
03:41:29,040 --> 03:41:31,200
And they are
these are very detailed videos.

3151
03:41:31,760 --> 03:41:36,160
So just make sure that the only slides
that you have written

3152
03:41:36,160 --> 03:41:38,920
which concepts are important for,
your interviews.

3153
03:41:39,240 --> 03:41:42,120
Just make sure you guys are watching
those videos

3154
03:41:43,200 --> 03:41:44,280
at least.

3155
03:41:44,280 --> 03:41:49,240
So here is the link.

3156
03:41:49,240 --> 03:41:53,040
I think you want us to run yours, please.

3157
03:41:53,040 --> 03:41:55,080
I think you want to sleep. Oscar.

3158
03:41:55,640 --> 03:41:57,480
Did you do that after Save button?

3159
03:41:57,480 --> 03:42:00,000
It shows other potentials that we insert

3160
03:42:01,640 --> 03:42:04,200
video that after

3161
03:42:04,200 --> 03:42:08,000
save button and show other credentials
that insert.

3162
03:42:08,400 --> 03:42:16,320
You mean the first name and the last name?

3163
03:42:16,320 --> 03:42:18,080
You want me to run? Michael?

3164
03:42:18,080 --> 03:42:19,800
Have I done something wrong?

3165
03:42:19,800 --> 03:42:24,960
Where is that step? Is

3166
03:42:25,920 --> 03:42:27,800
is. Is there something wrong in here?

3167
03:42:27,800 --> 03:42:31,440
150 No, no,
You guys got to watch 150 videos.

3168
03:42:31,440 --> 03:42:34,040
Just only those
which are important for your interviews.

3169
03:42:34,600 --> 03:42:39,360
This person has also used
very short tables with only 5 to 10 rows.

3170
03:42:39,360 --> 03:42:42,360
To explain the context.

3171
03:42:42,360 --> 03:42:46,520
And after watching these videos,
by the way, if you have time

3172
03:42:46,520 --> 03:42:48,960
and if you can watch,
you can write on your resume

3173
03:42:49,080 --> 03:42:53,840
that you have experience with Oracle,
as given my skill and skills

3174
03:42:53,840 --> 03:42:56,880
are about three different databases
from three different companies.

3175
03:42:57,400 --> 03:43:00,280
Just if you can manage the time

3176
03:43:01,120 --> 03:43:05,280
and it will be a very,
very good impact on you and to be honest,

3177
03:43:06,440 --> 03:43:11,040
only separate jobs
just for the is in the industry.

3178
03:43:11,040 --> 03:43:26,680
You guys can also do
the research on your own.

3179
03:43:26,680 --> 03:43:28,760
Okay. So then is here is here is the deal.

3180
03:43:28,760 --> 03:43:32,440
Even if we get any errors,
we are not solving those errors.

3181
03:43:32,520 --> 03:43:33,840
We are ending this class

3182
03:43:48,600 --> 03:43:51,280
in fast.

3183
03:43:51,280 --> 03:43:52,240
That's it

3184
03:43:53,760 --> 03:43:57,000
you are you getting any error
on your order?

3185
03:43:57,000 --> 03:44:01,160
No. Can be.

3186
03:44:01,160 --> 03:44:03,200
It did not pass.

3187
03:44:04,040 --> 03:44:05,720
You saw that? What?

3188
03:44:05,720 --> 03:44:08,480
I didn't see anything

3189
03:44:11,960 --> 03:44:13,440
after save button or.

3190
03:44:13,440 --> 03:44:15,600
Yes it changes the name. This is that.

3191
03:44:15,640 --> 03:44:17,200
That's what you guys want to tell me.

3192
03:44:17,200 --> 03:44:19,840
Yes, I know. This is this is a known bug?

3193
03:44:19,840 --> 03:44:20,800
That's what I was saying.

3194
03:44:20,800 --> 03:44:26,960
I will talk to the developers for this.

3195
03:44:26,960 --> 03:44:29,800
I will fix
it will be fixed by in one or two days.

3196
03:44:29,800 --> 03:44:32,280
Don't worry about that will be fixed.

3197
03:44:32,280 --> 03:44:38,080
I will talk to the developers.

3198
03:44:38,080 --> 03:44:41,400
What's the difference between
what are what are to learn and ask

3199
03:44:41,400 --> 03:44:45,240
you also these
What are and what told they are.

3200
03:44:45,400 --> 03:44:48,560
It is the underlying
implementation is different.

3201
03:44:48,680 --> 03:44:51,560
So it is and this stuff is related to

3202
03:44:52,600 --> 03:44:53,880
the DBA is only we

3203
03:44:53,880 --> 03:44:56,880
don't need to do
and we don't need to go into the details.

3204
03:44:56,880 --> 03:44:59,640
These are different variations
of the water as well.

3205
03:44:59,640 --> 03:45:02,960
Something this water is for backward
compatibility.

3206
03:45:03,280 --> 03:45:06,920
This what our tool was added
later in the databases.

3207
03:45:07,320 --> 03:45:11,000
But these tables, the schema, either
the architects or

3208
03:45:11,000 --> 03:45:14,960
the senior as they will be deciding
how to create these things as a tester.

3209
03:45:15,000 --> 03:45:17,920
Well,
you guys will never create these things.

3210
03:45:17,920 --> 03:45:20,680
Tell the developers always change to blah
blah, blah.

3211
03:45:20,680 --> 03:45:21,600
It's a big bug.

3212
03:45:21,600 --> 03:45:23,080
They don't do that to us.

3213
03:45:23,080 --> 03:45:25,640
Yes, I will talk to them tonight.

3214
03:45:25,640 --> 03:45:26,760
Sorry, which one is the bug?

3215
03:45:26,760 --> 03:45:29,120
They're not cool. You don't know the bug.

3216
03:45:29,120 --> 03:45:40,280
You guys have been using this outside
for so many years.

3217
03:45:40,280 --> 03:45:41,400
Five years, right?

3218
03:45:42,480 --> 03:45:44,280
All those five years.

3219
03:45:44,280 --> 03:45:45,480
Two years.

3220
03:45:45,480 --> 03:45:49,400
And all your efforts, right.

3221
03:45:49,480 --> 03:45:58,440
That you have put in this website.

3222
03:45:58,440 --> 03:46:00,520
Oh, by the way, is dated a student.

3223
03:46:00,520 --> 03:46:05,240
If you want to join, but I don't think so.

3224
03:46:05,240 --> 03:46:06,680
You guys need them, right?

3225
03:46:06,680 --> 03:46:10,200
You were also sleeping yesterday.

3226
03:46:10,200 --> 03:46:15,480
We are now enrolling in program.

3227
03:46:15,480 --> 03:46:18,320
All right, guys.

3228
03:46:18,600 --> 03:46:20,000

3229
03:46:20,000 --> 03:46:21,800
Take some rest

3230
03:46:21,960 --> 03:46:24,360
and I will see you next week.

3231
03:46:24,360 --> 03:46:26,000
Maybe for the Jenkins classes.

3232
03:46:26,000 --> 03:46:28,800
We have to prepare
one list of questions for

3233
03:46:31,280 --> 03:46:33,800
for previous library

3234
03:46:33,920 --> 03:46:43,760
guys, for the students.

3235
03:46:43,760 --> 03:46:44,840
It works better.

3236
03:46:44,840 --> 03:46:45,640
Take care.

3237
03:46:45,640 --> 03:46:49,320
Thank you, guys. Thank you so much.
